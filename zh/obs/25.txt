Satan said, “If you are the Son of God, turn these rocks into bread so you can eat!”


撒旦说；“你若是神的儿子，把这些石头变成你可以吃的食物。”

Jesus replied, “It is written in God’s Word, ‘Man does not live only on bread, but on every word that God speaks!’”


耶稣回答说："经上记着说‘人活着，不是单靠食物，乃是靠着神口里所出的一切话’”。

Then Satan took Jesus to the highest point on the Temple and said, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written, ‘He will command His angels to catch you so your foot does not hit the ground.’”


撒旦带着耶稣到殿顶上说：“你若是神的儿子，跳下去，因为经上记着说‘主要为你吩咐他的使者用手托着你，免得你的脚碰在石头上’”。

But Jesus replied, “It is also written in God’s Word, ‘Do not test God.’”


耶稣回答说：“经上又记着说：'不可试探主你的神’。”

Then Satan showed Jesus all the kingdoms of the world and all their glory and said, “I will give you all this if you bow down and worship me.”


撒旦将世上的万国和万国的荣华都指给他看，对他说：“你若俯伏拜我，我就把这一切都赐给你。”

Jesus replied, “Get away from me, Satan! It is written in God’s Word, ‘Worship only the Lord your God.’”


耶稣说：“撒旦退去吧。因为经上记着说：‘当拜主你的神’。”

Then Satan left him to wait for a better time. Angels came and took care of Jesus.


于是撒旦就走了等待时机。天使就来伺候他。
