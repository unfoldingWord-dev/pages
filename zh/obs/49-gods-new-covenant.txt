Because of your sin, you are guilty. You deserve death and God’s anger, but God poured out His anger on Jesus instead. When Jesus died on the cross, he received your punishment.由于你的罪，你是有罪恶感的。你应得的就是死和神的愤怒，但是神将他的愤怒倾倒在了耶稣的身上。当耶稣在十字架上死去的时候，他接受了你应受到的惩罚。

{{:en:obs:obs-49-11.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

Jesus chose to die as a perfect, sinless sacrifice to take away your sins and the sins of the whole world. Because of Jesus, any sin can be forgiven, no matter what it is.耶稣选择成为一个完美无罪的祭品来洗去你的罪和这世界的罪。由于耶稣，无论何罪，都能被赦免。

{{:en:obs:obs-49-12.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

No one can be saved by doing good things. Nothing you do can fix your relationship with God. Your sins can only be washed away if you believe that Jesus is the Son of God, and that he died and rose again to take away your sins.没有人能因为做了好事就能得救。你没有办法修复你与神的关系。你的罪只有通过你相信耶稣是神的儿子，而他死而复活后除去你的罪才能得到赦免。

{{:en:obs:obs-49-13.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

Anyone who believes in Jesus and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be rejected. It does not matter if you are rich or poor, man or woman, old or young, or where you are from. God loves you and wants you to believe in Jesus so He can have a relationship with you.任何相信耶稣并受洗的人都可以得救，但那些不相信的就不能得救。这跟你无论是富有还是贫穷，是男人还是女人，是老人还是小孩，是来自哪里没有关系。神爱你，想要你相信耶稣，这样，他就能和你建立关系。

{{:en:obs:obs-49-14.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

Do you believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the only Son of God? Do you believe that you are a sinner and deserve God’s punishment? Do you believe that Jesus died on the cross to take away your sins? Jesus invites you to come to him, believe in him, and be baptized.你相信耶稣就是弥赛亚，神的儿子么？你相信你是罪人，应得神的惩罚么？你相信耶稣死在了十字架上，除去了你的罪么？耶稣邀请你来到他那里，相信他，来受洗。

{{:en:obs:obs-49-15.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

If you believe this, you are a Christian! God has taken you out of Satan’s kingdom of darkness and put you into God’s Kingdom of light. All the old things are gone, because God makes all things new.如果你相信，你就是一个基督徒了！神已经带你出了撒旦的黑暗王国，把你放到神的光明王国里。所有的旧事都去了，因为神让所有的都成为了新的。

{{:en:obs:obs-49-16.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

If you are a Christian, your sins are forgiven because of what Jesus did. Now, when God looks at you, He does not see you as an enemy, but He sees you as a close friend.如果你是一个基督徒，你的罪就因为耶稣所做的得到了赦免。现在，当神看到你的时候，他就不把你当成一个敌人，而是把你看成一个朋友。

God tells you to pray, study His Word, worship Him with other Christians, and tell others what He has done for you. All of these things help you to grow in your relationship with Him.神让你去祷告，学他的话语，和其他基督徒一起敬拜他，告诉其他人他所为你做的。所有这些都帮助你在与神的关系里得到成长。
