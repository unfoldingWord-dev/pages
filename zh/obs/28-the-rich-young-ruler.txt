One day a rich young ruler came up to Jesus and asked him, “Good teacher, what good thing must I do to have eternal life?” Jesus said to him, “Why do you call me good? There is only One who is good, and that is God. But if you want to have eternal life, obey God’s laws.”


一天，一个青年财主来到耶稣面前问他：“良善的夫子，我当作什么事才可以承受永生？”耶稣对他说：“你为什么称我是良善的呢？除了神以外，再没有良善的。如果你想承受永生，就当遵守神的诫命。”

“Which ones?” he asked. Jesus replied, “Do not murder. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not lie. Honor your father and mother, and love your neighbor as you love yourself.”


“你说的是哪一条呢？”他问到。耶稣说：“不可杀人，不可奸淫，不可偷盗，不可说谎，当孝敬你的父母，又当爱人如己。”

The young man, trying to prove that he was right, said, “I have obeyed all these laws ever since I was a boy. What do I still need to do?” Jesus looked at him and loved him.


青年人为了证明自己是对的，又问道：“这一切我从小就遵守了。我还要做什么？” 耶稣看着他就爱他。

Jesus answered, “If you want to be perfect, then go and sell everything you own and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure waiting for you in heaven. Then come and follow me.”


耶稣回答说：“如果你想要完美，那就变卖你所有的分给穷人，就必有财宝在天上，你还要来跟从我。”

When the young man heard this, he became very sad, because he was very rich. He turned and went away from Jesus, unwilling to give up his wealth.


他听见这些就就忧愁了，因为他很富有。于是他走掉了，不愿意放弃他的财富。

Then Jesus said to his disciples, “How hard it is for rich people to enter into the Kingdom of God! Yes, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God.”


耶稣对门徒说：“有钱财的人进神的国是何等地难啊！骆驼穿过针的眼，比财主进神的国还容易呢。”

When the disciples heard this they were shocked and said, “Then who can be saved?”


门徒听到他的话就希奇问：“那谁能得救？”

Jesus looked at them and said, “With people this is impossible, but with God, all things are possible.”


耶稣看着他们说：“在人是不能，在神却不然，因为神，凡事都能。”

Peter said to Jesus, “We have left everything and followed you. What will be our reward?”


彼得就对他说：“我们已经撇下所有的跟从你了。我们的奖赏会是什么呢？”

Jesus answered, “Everyone who has left houses, brothers, sisters, father, mother, children, or property for my name’s sake, will inherit 100 times more in the next world and also eternal life. But many who are first will be last, and those who are last will be first.”


耶稣回答说：“人为我撇下房屋，或者弟兄、姐妹、父母、儿女、天地，在今世就会得到百倍多来世得永生的。然而，许多在前的，将要在后，在后的将要在前。”
