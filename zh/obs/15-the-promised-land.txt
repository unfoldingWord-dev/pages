终于到了以色列民可以进入到应许之地的时候了。约书亚差派了两个探子进入迦南地和耶利哥城。这城被高大的城墙保护着。一名叫喇合的妓女，因为信神的缘故，救了两个探子并且帮助他们逃跑。两个探子也承诺当神将这座城赐给他们的时候，他们必恩待这个女人和她的家庭。At last it was time for the Israelites to enter the Promised Land. Joshua sent two spies to the Canaanite city of Jericho. It was protected by strong walls. A prostitute named Rahab protected the spies and helped them escape because she believed God. They promised to protect Rahab and her family when Jericho was destroyed.

要进入应许之地，必须先过约旦河。神告诉约书亚：“使祭司走在前面。”当祭司的脚站在约旦河里的时候，水就停止了流动，以色列民就可以从干地上直接走过了。To enter into the Promised Land, the Israelites had to cross the Jordan River. God told Joshua, “Have the priests go first.” When the priests’ feet touched the Jordan River, the water stopped flowing so the Israelites could cross over on dry ground.

当百姓穿过约旦河后，神告诉约书亚怎样攻打强大的耶利哥城。百姓顺服了神。士兵和祭司六天来每天绕耶利哥城行进一圈。After the people crossed the Jordan River, God told Joshua how to attack the powerful city of Jericho. The people obeyed God. The soldiers and priests marched around the city of Jericho once a day for six days.

到了第七日，他们绕城七圈。在最后一圈时，祭司吹响号角，士兵听到角声就大声呼喊。On the seventh day, they marched around the city seven times. On the last time around the city, the soldiers shouted while the priests blew on their trumpets.

这围绕这城的墙就倒塌了！以色列人按神的命令摧毁了这城的一切。只有喇合和她的家人幸免。她们也成为了以色列的百姓。当迦南地其他的人听到耶利哥城的事都十分地害怕。And the walls around the city fell down! The Israelites destroyed everything in the city as God had commanded. Only Rahab and her family were saved. They became part of the Israelites. When the rest of the Canaanites heard about what had happened to Jericho they were terrified.

迦南人的一族，基遍人俯伏在约书亚面前说，他们住在很远的地方。他请求和约书亚和他们立约讲和。神告诉以色列人不要与迦南地的人和平相处，但是约书亚和以色列人没有向神求问，基遍人从哪而来。因此，约束亚就与基遍人立了约。。The Canaanite tribe of Gibeon lied to Joshua and said they were from far away. They asked Joshua to make peace with them. God had commanded the Israelites not to make peace with any Canaanites, but Joshua and the Israelites did not ask God where the Gibeonites were from. So Joshua made peace with them.

当迦南地的其他族人听说基遍人与以色列人立了约，就集结在一起攻打基遍。基遍就向约书亚发信求救。When the other Canaanites heard that the Gibeonites had made peace with the Israelites, they joined their armies and attacked Gibeon. The Gibeonites sent a message to Joshua asking for help.

约书亚因为被骗而非常生气，（因为基遍人就住在附近）但他还是召集了以色列的军队连夜行进至基遍。在清晨的时候，他们突袭了迦南军队。Joshua was angry that he had been tricked, but he gathered the Israelite army, and they marched all night to reach the Gibeonites. In the early morning they surprised their Canaanite enemies and attacked them.

神使迦南人陷入迷惑中。这天神为以色列民争战，巨石砸向迦南人，消灭了众多。God threw the Canaanites into confusion. God fought for Israel that day by sending large hailstones that killed many of the Canaanites.


{{:en:obs:obs-15-10.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


神甚至使日头不落，以此以色列人能在白日中完成攻击。神在那日为以色列民赢得了巨大的胜利。God also made the sun stand still in the sky so that Israel could finish defeating the Canaanites. God won a great victory for Israel that day.


{{:en:obs:obs-15-11.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


这次败战之后，其余的迦南人集聚在一起攻打以色列人，约书亚带领百姓消灭了他们。After this defeat, the rest of the Canaanites who were left gathered together to attack Israel. Joshua and the Israelites attacked and destroyed them.

战役结束后，神给以色列每个支派相应的地界作为他们的应许之地，并且使四围都与他们和平相处。After this battle, God gave each tribe of Israel their own section of the Promised Land. Then God gave Israel peace along all its borders.


{{:en:obs:obs-15-13.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


当约书亚年老时，他聚集了以色列的百姓。他重申了神在西奈山上与以色列民所立的约。百姓承诺会持守对神的信心，并且遵行神所立的律法。When Joshua was an old man, he called all the people of Israel together. Then Joshua renewed the covenant that God had made with the Israelites at Sinai. The people promised to remain faithful to God and follow his laws.
