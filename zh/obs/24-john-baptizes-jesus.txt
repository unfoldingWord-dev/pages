When John grew up, he became a prophet. He lived in the wilderness, ate wild honey and locusts, and wore clothes made from camel hair.约翰长大后，成了一个先知。他住在旷野，吃野蜜和昆虫，穿骆驼毛的衣服。

Many people came to listen to John. He preached to them, saying, “Repent, for the Kingdom of God is near!”许多人来听约翰讲道。他教训他们，说，“悔改吧，神的天国已经近了！”

Some people repented and were baptized when they heard John’s message, but there were many religious leaders who came to be baptized without repenting and confessing their sins.有一些人悔改，当他们听了约翰的道后就受洗了，但是仍有很多宗教领袖来受洗时既不悔改，也不承认自己的罪。

John said to the religious leaders, “You bunch of snakes! Repent and change your behavior. Every tree that does not bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.” This fulfilled what the prophet Isaiah said, “Behold, I send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way.”约翰对这些宗教领袖们说，“你们这毒蛇的种类！当悔改，改变你们的行为。不结好果子的树都要被砍下来，丢进火里。”这正应了先知以赛亚所说的，“看啊，在你之前，我预备了信使，好预备你的路。”

Some Jews asked John if he was the Messiah. John replied, “I am not the Messiah, but there is someone coming after me who is much greater than I am. I am not even worthy to untie his sandals.”有些犹太人问约翰他是否是弥赛亚。约翰说，“我不是弥赛亚，但那在我之后将来的，比我更大。我连给他系鞋带也不配。”

The next day, Jesus came to be baptized by John. When John saw him, he said, “Look! There is the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world.”第二天，耶稣来要约翰为他施洗。约翰看到他后说，“看啊！神的羔羊，带走这世界罪的。！”

John said to Jesus, “I am not worthy to baptize you. You should baptize me instead.” But Jesus said, “You should baptize me, because it is the right thing to do.” So John baptized him, but not because Jesus had sinned—he never sinned.约翰对耶稣说，“我不配为你施洗。你应该为我施洗。”耶稣说，“你当为我施洗，因为这样做是对的。”

When Jesus came out of the water, the Spirit of God took the appearance of a dove and landed on him. At the same time a voice from heaven said, “You are My beloved Son, and with you I am well pleased.”当耶稣送水里出来的时候，神的灵像鸽子般落在他身上。与此同时，天上有声音说，“你是我的爱子，我所喜悦的。”

God had told John, “The Holy Spirit will land on someone you baptize. He is the Son of God.” There is only one God. But God is three persons, the Father, Jesus the Son, and the Holy Spirit.神曾告诉约翰，“圣灵将降在你所施洗的某个人身上，他就是神的儿子。”神只有一位，但神是三个位份，父，儿子耶稣，和圣灵。
