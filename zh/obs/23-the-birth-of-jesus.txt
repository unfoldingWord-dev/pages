The angel said, “Joseph, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife. What is in her has been conceived by the Holy Spirit. She will give birth to a son. Name him Jesus, because he will save the people from their sins.”天使说，“约瑟，不要怕，尽管娶回玛利亚。她乃是从圣灵怀的孕。她将生一个儿子。叫他耶稣，因为他将救他的民脱离罪。

About the time Mary was to give birth, the Roman government told everyone to go to the town of their ancestors for a census. Mary and Joseph had to make a long journey from where they lived in Nazareth to Bethlehem.玛利亚快生的时候，罗马政府命令人民回到他们祖先居住的地方来报名上册。玛利亚和约瑟走了很长的路，才从他们居住的地方拿撒勒来到了伯利恒。

When they arrived in Bethlehem, there was no place to stay. The only room they could find was a place where animals stayed. The baby was born there and his mother laid him in a feeding trough, since they did not have a bed for him. They named him Jesus.他们到达伯利恒后，已经没有住宿的地方了。只有一个动物呆的地方可供他们歇脚。孩子就在那里出生。因为没有床，他的母亲只能把孩子放在食槽里。他们叫他耶稣。

That night, there were some shepherds in a nearby field watching their flocks. Suddenly, a shining angel appeared to them, and they were terrified. The angel said, “Do not be afraid, because I have some good news for you. The Messiah has been born!”那晚，有一些牧羊人在附近的田里看管羊群。突然，一个天使向他们显现，他们非常害怕。天使说，“不要怕，因我带来了好消息给你们。弥赛亚已经降生了！”

“Go search for the baby, and you will find him wrapped in pieces of cloth and lying in a manger.” Suddenly, the skies were filled with angels singing and praising God, saying, “Glory to God in heaven and peace on earth to the people He favors!”寻找那孩子，你们会发现他被几块布包裹，躺在食槽里。”突然，空中满是天使歌唱，赞美神，说，“荣耀归于神，和平归向全地，和他所宠爱的人！”

When the shepherds arrived at the place where Jesus was, they found him lying in a manger, just as the angel had told them. They were very excited. Mary was very happy, too. The shepherds returned to the fields, praising God for all they had heard and seen.

Some time later, wise men from countries far to the east saw an unusual star in the sky. They realized it meant a new king of the Jews was born. So, they traveled a great distance to see this king. They came to Bethlehem and found the place where Jesus was living.

When they saw Jesus with his mother, they fell down and worshiped him. They gave Jesus expensive gifts. Then they returned home.
