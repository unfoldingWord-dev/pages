Saul was the first king of Israel. He was tall and handsome, just like the people wanted. Saul did well at first, but he became a wicked man who did not obey God, so God chose a different man to be king in his place.
扫罗是以色列的第一位国王，生的高大俊美，正如百姓所期望的。扫罗一开始做的很好，讨神喜欢，但是后来他变得悖逆，不遵从神了。所以神选了另外一个人来代替扫罗。

This man’s name was David. He was a shepherd. While watching the sheep, David had killed both a lion and a bear which had attacked the sheep. David was also a humble and righteous man who trusted and obeyed God.
这个人就是大卫，他是一个牧羊人。大卫放羊的时候，杀死了袭击羊群的一只狮子和一头熊。大卫为人谦卑正直，信靠神。

David was also a great soldier and leader. When David was still a young man, he fought against a giant named Goliath. Goliath was a trained soldier, very strong, and almost three meters tall! But God helped David kill Goliath and save Israel.
大卫也是一个英勇的战士和领导。在他还年轻时，他与一个叫歌利亚的人对战。歌利亚是一个个头差不多三米，经过训练的强壮的战士。但是神帮助大卫杀死了歌利亚，挽救了以色列。

Saul became jealous of David and tried many times to kill him. One day Saul was looking for David so he could kill him. Saul went into the same cave where David was hiding. Instead of killing Saul, David cut off a piece of his clothes to prove to Saul that he would not kill him to become king.
扫罗开始嫉妒大卫了，还曾多次想杀死他。有天，扫罗找大卫想杀死他，就去了大卫的藏身之洞。大卫擒住了扫罗，没有杀他，反而从身上扯下一块布证明给扫罗看他不会杀掉扫罗取代他的王位。

Eventually, Saul died in battle, and David became king of Israel. He was a good king, and the people loved him. God blessed David and made him successful. David fought many battles and God gave him victory. David conquered Jerusalem and made it his capital. During David’s reign, Israel became powerful and wealthy.
最终，扫罗死在战场，大卫取代他成为以色列国王。大卫是一个好国王，深得百姓爱戴。神祝福大卫，叫他凡事顺利。大卫身经百战，都取得了胜利。大卫还攻克了耶路撒冷，使它成为以色列首都。在大卫统治期间，以色列变得强大富有。

David wanted to build a temple where everybody could worship God and offer Him sacrifices. For about 400 years, the people had been worshiping God and offering sacrifices to Him at the Tent of Meeting that Moses had built.

God sent the prophet Nathan to David with this message, “Because you are a man of war, you will not build Me this house; your son will. But, I will bless you greatly. Someone from your family will always sit on the throne of Israel. And the Messiah will be one of your descendants!” The Messiah is God’s Chosen One who would save the world from sin.

{{:en:obs:obs-17-08.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

When David heard these words, he immediately thanked and praised God because He had promised David great honor and many blessings. The Israelites would have to wait a long time before the Messiah came, almost 1,000 years.

David ruled with justice and faithfulness for many years, and God blessed him. However, toward the end of his life he sinned terribly before God.

One day, when all of his soldiers were out fighting, David got up from an afternoon nap and saw a beautiful woman bathing. Her name was Bathsheba.

{{:en:obs:obs-17-11.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

Instead of looking away, David sent someone to bring her to him. He slept with her and sent her back home. A short time later Bathsheba sent a message to David saying that she was pregnant.

Her husband, Uriah, was one of David’s best soldiers. David called Uriah back from the battle and told him to go be with his wife. But Uriah refused to go home while the rest of the soldiers were in battle. So David sent Uriah back to the battle and had him placed where the enemy was strongest so that he would be killed.

{{:en:obs:obs-17-13.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

After Uriah was killed, David married Bathsheba. Later, she gave birth to a son. God was not pleased with what David had done, so He sent the prophet Nathan to show David his sin. David repented of his sin and God forgave him. For the rest of his life, David trusted God, even in difficult times.

{{:en:obs:obs-17-14.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

But as punishment for his sin, David’s baby boy died. There was also fighting in David’s family for the rest of his life, and David’s power was greatly weakened. Though David had been unfaithful to God, God was still faithful to His promises. Bathsheba gave birth to another son named Solomon.
