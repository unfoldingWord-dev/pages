Saul was the first king of Israel. He was tall and handsome, just like the people wanted. Saul did well at first, but he became a wicked man who did not obey God, so God chose a different man to be king in his place.
扫罗是以色列的第一位国王，生的高大俊美，正如百姓所期望的。扫罗一开始做的很好，讨神喜欢，但是后来他变得悖逆，不遵从神了。所以神选了另外一个人来代替扫罗。

This man’s name was David. He was a shepherd. While watching the sheep, David had killed both a lion and a bear which had attacked the sheep. David was also a humble and righteous man who trusted and obeyed God.
这个人就是大卫，他是一个牧羊人。大卫放羊的时候，杀死了袭击羊群的一只狮子和一头熊。大卫为人谦卑正直，信靠神。

David was also a great soldier and leader. When David was still a young man, he fought against a giant named Goliath. Goliath was a trained soldier, very strong, and almost three meters tall! But God helped David kill Goliath and save Israel.
大卫也是一个英勇的战士和领导。在他还年轻时，他与一个叫歌利亚的人对战。歌利亚是一个个头差不多三米，经过训练的强壮的战士。但是神帮助大卫杀死了歌利亚，挽救了以色列。

Saul became jealous of David and tried many times to kill him. One day Saul was looking for David so he could kill him. Saul went into the same cave where David was hiding. Instead of killing Saul, David cut off a piece of his clothes to prove to Saul that he would not kill him to become king.
扫罗开始嫉妒大卫了，还曾多次想杀死他。有天，扫罗找大卫想杀死他，就去了大卫的藏身之洞。大卫擒住了扫罗，没有杀他，反而从身上扯下一块布证明给扫罗看他不会杀掉扫罗取代他的王位。

Eventually, Saul died in battle, and David became king of Israel. He was a good king, and the people loved him. God blessed David and made him successful. David fought many battles and God gave him victory. David conquered Jerusalem and made it his capital. During David’s reign, Israel became powerful and wealthy.
最终，扫罗死在战场，大卫取代他成为以色列国王。大卫是一个好国王，深得百姓爱戴。神祝福大卫，叫他凡事顺利。大卫身经百战，都取得了胜利。大卫还攻克了耶路撒冷，使它成为以色列首都。在大卫统治期间，以色列变得强大富有。

David wanted to build a temple where everybody could worship God and offer Him sacrifices. For about 400 years, the people had been worshiping God and offering sacrifices to Him at the Tent of Meeting that Moses had built.
大卫想建造一个神殿，叫百姓可以在这敬拜神和献祭。这四百多年里，人们一直在摩西修建的会幕里敬拜和献祭。

God sent the prophet Nathan to David with this message, “Because you are a man of war, you will not build Me this house; your son will. But, I will bless you greatly. Someone from your family will always sit on the throne of Israel. And the Messiah will be one of your descendants!” The Messiah is God’s Chosen One who would save the world from sin.
神派先知内森告诉大卫，说：“因为你是属战争的，你不可为我建殿，但是你的儿子可以。我将大大的祝福与你。你家中一人将一直坐在以色列宝座上。弥赛亚也将是你的后裔。弥赛亚就是神拣选的将救世人脱离于罪。

When David heard these words, he immediately thanked and praised God because He had promised David great honor and many blessings. The Israelites would have to wait a long time before the Messiah came, almost 1,000 years.
大卫听到这些后，就感谢赞美神。因为神给了大卫荣耀的应许和很多祝福。以色列人等弥赛亚来要很长时间，差不多1000年。

David ruled with justice and faithfulness for many years, and God blessed him. However, toward the end of his life he sinned terribly before God.
大卫用公义和信实管理国家很多年，神也祝福于他。然而，年老时，大卫却在神面前犯了很多罪。

One day, when all of his soldiers were out fighting, David got up from an afternoon nap and saw a beautiful woman bathing. Her name was Bathsheba.
有一天，所以士兵都出去征战了。大卫午觉醒来后看到一个拔示巴叫美丽的女子在沐浴。
{{:en:obs:obs-17-11.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

Instead of looking away, David sent someone to bring her to him. He slept with her and sent her back home. A short time later Bathsheba sent a message to David saying that she was pregnant.
大卫没有转过头，反而派人带那女子到他跟前来。大卫与她同房，然后她就回家去了。一段日子后，她打发人去告诉大卫她怀孕了。{{:en:obs:obs-17-12.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

Her husband, Uriah, was one of David’s best soldiers. David called Uriah back from the battle and told him to go be with his wife. But Uriah refused to go home while the rest of the soldiers were in battle. So David sent Uriah back to the battle and had him placed where the enemy was strongest so that he would be killed.
她的丈夫，乌利亚是大卫最好的士兵之一。大卫差人把乌利亚从战场带回到他的妻子身边。乌利亚拒绝回家去，因为其他士兵还在战场杀敌。大卫就把乌利亚放在敌人罪凶猛的地方，乌利亚因此被杀了。

After Uriah was killed, David married Bathsheba. Later, she gave birth to a son. God was not pleased with what David had done, so He sent the prophet Nathan to show David his sin. David repented of his sin and God forgave him. For the rest of his life, David trusted God, even in difficult times.
乌利亚被杀后，大卫就娶了拔示巴。她给大卫生了一个儿子。但大卫所行的事，神很不喜欢，就差那单去告诉大卫他所犯的罪。大卫悔改了，神原谅了他。以后的日子里，大卫一直信靠神，即使在很困难的日子里。

But as punishment for his sin, David’s baby boy died. There was also fighting in David’s family for the rest of his life, and David’s power was greatly weakened. Though David had been unfaithful to God, God was still faithful to His promises. Bathsheba gave birth to another son named Solomon.
但作为罪的惩罚，大卫的儿子死了，在他的余生里，家中也一直有争战，他的势力也大大的消弱了。尽管大卫曾对神不忠，但神是信实的，恪守着他的应许。拔示巴又给大卫生了一个儿子，叫所罗门。
