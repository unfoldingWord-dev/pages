They came to a place called “The Skull” and nailed his arms and feet to the cross. But Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, because they do not know what they are doing.” Pilate commanded that a sign be put above Jesus’ head that read, “King of the Jews.”
他们来到一个叫“骷髅”的地方，把耶稣的手脚钉在十字架上。但是耶稣却祷告说：“父啊，请原谅他们，因为他们自己在做什么。”彼拉多吩咐人把写着“犹太人的王”的牌子放在耶稣头上。

The soldiers gambled for Jesus’ clothing. When they did this, they fulfilled a prophecy which said, “They divided my garments among them, and gambled for my clothing.”
士兵分抢耶稣的衣服。这也正应验了先知说的话，“他们分了我的外衣，为我的里衣抓阄。”

Jesus was crucified between two robbers. One of them mocked Jesus, but the other said, “Don’t you fear God? We are guilty, but this man is innocent. Jesus, please remember me in your Kingdom.” Jesus said to him, “Today, you will be with me in Paradise.”
耶稣被钉在两个强盗中间。一个强盗笑话他，另外一个却说：“你不怕神吗？我们是有罪的，但是这个人却是无辜的。耶稣，请在你的国里纪念哦。”耶稣说：“今天，你将和我同进天堂。”

Then Jesus cried out, “It is finished! Father, I give my spirit into your hands.” Then he bowed his head and gave up his spirit. When he died, there was an earthquake and the large curtain in the Temple that separated the presence of God from the people was torn in two, from the top to the bottom.
耶稣大声呼喊说：“成了！我把我的灵交托在你手上。”然后低下头，将自己的灵魂交付神了。他死的时候，有地震发生，将殿里的幔子（用来将人和神分开）从上到下撕开了。

Through his death, Jesus opened a way for people to come to God. When the soldier guarding Jesus saw everything that happened, he said, “Certainly, this man was innocent. He must have been the Son of God.”
耶稣用他的死为人们开了一条通往神的路。守卫的士兵看到一切后说：“诚然，这个人是无辜的。他确实是神的儿子。”

Then Joseph and Nicodemus, two Jewish leaders who believed Jesus was the Messiah, asked Pilate for Jesus’ body. They wrapped his body in cloth and buried it in a tomb cut out of rock. Then they rolled a large stone over the opening.
两个犹太人领袖约瑟和尼哥德慕相信耶稣是神的儿子，他们向彼拉多求要耶稣的尸体。他们用布裹住耶稣的身体后，把他葬在石头堆地坟墓里，在墓口还放了一块大石头。
