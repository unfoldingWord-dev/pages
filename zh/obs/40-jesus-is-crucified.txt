They came to a place called “The Skull” and nailed his arms and feet to the cross. But Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, because they do not know what they are doing.” Pilate commanded that a sign be put above Jesus’ head that read, “King of the Jews.”
他们来到一个叫“骷髅”的地方，把耶稣的手脚钉在十字架上。但是耶稣却祷告说：“父啊，请原谅他们，因为他们自己在做什么。”彼拉多吩咐人把写着“犹太人的王”的牌子放在耶稣头上。

The soldiers gambled for Jesus’ clothing. When they did this, they fulfilled a prophecy which said, “They divided my garments among them, and gambled for my clothing.”

Jesus was crucified between two robbers. One of them mocked Jesus, but the other said, “Don’t you fear God? We are guilty, but this man is innocent. Jesus, please remember me in your Kingdom.” Jesus said to him, “Today, you will be with me in Paradise.”

The crowd and the Jewish leaders mocked Jesus, saying, “If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross and save yourself! Then we will believe you.”

It was the middle of the day, but darkness came over the whole land. It stayed dark from noon until 3:00 in the afternoon.

Then Jesus cried out, “It is finished! Father, I give my spirit into your hands.” Then he bowed his head and gave up his spirit. When he died, there was an earthquake and the large curtain in the Temple that separated the presence of God from the people was torn in two, from the top to the bottom.

Through his death, Jesus opened a way for people to come to God. When the soldier guarding Jesus saw everything that happened, he said, “Certainly, this man was innocent. He must have been the Son of God.”

Then Joseph and Nicodemus, two Jewish leaders who believed Jesus was the Messiah, asked Pilate for Jesus’ body. They wrapped his body in cloth and buried it in a tomb cut out of rock. Then they rolled a large stone over the opening.
