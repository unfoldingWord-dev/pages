耶稣差派门徒去各地宣讲福音。他们回来就告诉耶稣教了什么，做了什么。于是，耶稣便邀请他们至安静处稍事休息。因此，他们就上了船，离开了。

但有许多人看到了耶稣和门徒离开，他们便沿着河岸跑到了对面。当耶稣和门徒到达时，有成群结队的人来欢迎他们。

这人群中，不算妇人和孩子，有五千人。耶稣就大大地怜悯他们。耶稣看这些人就像没有牧人的羊群。耶稣就教导他们并医治他们的疾病。

天色将晚，门徒告诉耶稣附近没有村庄，请叫大家散开，自己找东西吃。

But Jesus said to them, “You give them something to eat!” The disciples responded, “How can we do that? We only have five loaves of bread and two fish.”

Jesus called the crowd to him and told them to sit down in groups on the grass.

Then he took the five loaves of bread and the two fish, looked up to heaven, and blessed the food.

Jesus then started breaking the bread and fish. He gave the pieces to his disciples to give to the people. The disciples kept passing out the food, and it never ran out! All the people ate and were satisfied.

The disciples even picked up twelve baskets full of leftover food that had not been eaten. All the food came from the five loaves of bread and two fish.
