More than 400 years after the last prophet spoke to the Jews, an angel appeared to an old priest named Zechariah. He was a godly man, but his wife, Elizabeth, could not have any children.在最后一个先知对以色列人说话之后400多年，一个天使向一个叫撒迦利亚的祭司显现。他是一个圣洁的人，但他的妻子，伊丽莎白，不能生育。

The angel said to Zechariah, “Your wife will have a son. You will name him John. He will be the great prophet that comes before the Messiah!” Zechariah responded, “My wife and I are too old to have children! How will I know this will happen?”天使对撒迦利亚说，“你的妻子将有一个儿子。你要给他起名叫约翰。他将成为弥赛亚到来之前的大先知！”撒迦利亚回应道，“我的妻和我都太老了，不可能有孩子的！我怎会知道这些事会不会发生呢？”

The angel answered, “I was sent by God to bring you this good news. Because you did not believe me, you will not be able to speak until the child is born.” Immediately, Zechariah was unable to speak. Then the angel left. Zechariah returned home, and his wife became pregnant.天使回答道，“我是奉神差遣带给你这个好消息的。因为你不信我，你从现在起将不能说话，直到那孩子出世。”立刻，撒迦利亚便哑了。天使离开。撒迦利亚回家，她的妻子便怀孕了。

When Elizabeth was six months pregnant, the same angel appeared to Elizabeth’s relative, whose name was Mary. She was a virgin and was engaged to a man named Joseph. The angel said, “You will become pregnant and give birth to a son.”当伊丽莎白怀孕六个月的时候，同一个天使向伊丽莎白的亲戚，玛利亚显现。她还是处女，并且已经许配给了一个男人，名叫约瑟。天使说，“你会怀孕并且会生一个男孩。”

The angel continued, “You are to name him Jesus. He will be the Messiah!” Mary replied, “How can this be, since I am a virgin?” The angel explained, “The Holy Spirit will come over you, and you will conceive. So your son will be called the Son of the Most High God.”天使继续说，“你要叫他耶稣。他就是弥赛亚！”玛利亚回应道，“这事怎么能成呢？我还是个处女啊？”天使解释道，“圣灵将会降临到你身上，你会怀孕。所以你的儿子将会被称为至高神的儿子。”

Not long after this, Mary went and visited Elizabeth. As soon as Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, Elizabeth’s baby jumped inside her. The women rejoiced together about what God had done for them. After visiting for three months, Mary returned home.不久之后，玛利亚去拜访伊丽莎白。当伊丽莎白一听到玛利亚打招呼，她腹中的胎儿就跳跃。女人们因为神为她们所做的而喜乐。玛利亚在那住了三个月后就回去自己家。

After Elizabeth gave birth to her baby boy, they named him John as the angel commanded. Then God allowed Zechariah to speak again. He said, “Praise God, because He has remembered His people! You, my son, will be called the prophet of the Most High God! You will prepare the way for the Messiah!”当伊丽莎白生下男孩后，他们按照天使的命令，给他起名约翰。神又允许撒迦利亚说话。他说，“赞美神，因为他仍记得他的民！你，我的儿子，将被称为至高神的先知！你将为弥赛亚预备道路！”
