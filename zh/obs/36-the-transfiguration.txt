One day, Jesus took three of his disciples, Peter, James, and John with him. (This John was not the same person who baptized Jesus.) They went up on a high mountain by themselves.  一天，耶稣带着他的三个徒弟彼得、杰姆斯和约翰出行。（这里的约翰不是给耶稣能够施洗的约翰。）他们徒步登上一座高山。

All of a sudden, Jesus’ face became as bright as the sun and his clothes became as white as light, whiter than anyone on earth could make them.突然之间，耶稣的脸变得跟太阳光一样闪亮，他的衣服发出和光一样的白色，比世上所有人都要闪耀。

Then Moses and Elijah, who had both lived hundreds of years earlier, appeared. They talked with Jesus about his death which would soon happen in Jerusalem.后来曾经生活在几百年前的摩西和以利亚都显现了。他们之间互相讨论耶稣即将要在耶路撒冷受死的事情。

As Moses and Elijah were talking with Jesus, Peter said, “Jesus, it is good for us to be here. Let us make three tents, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.” Peter did not know what he was saying.正当摩西和以利亚与耶稣交谈之际。彼得说“耶稣，我们在这里很不错。让我们来搭建三个帐篷吧。一个给你，一个给摩西，还有一个给以利亚。”彼得并不知道他在说什么。

As Peter was talking, a bright cloud came down on top of them and a voice from the cloud said, “This is My Son whom I love. I am pleased with him. Listen to him.” The three disciples were terrified and fell on the ground.彼得说话的时候，一束光亮的云朵降临到他们头顶，还伴随着一个声音“这是我喜爱的儿子，我非常爱他。你们要听从他。"

Then Jesus touched them and said, “Do not be afraid. Get up.” When they looked around they saw no one but Jesus.于是抚摸着他们说道，“不要害怕，快快起来。”当他们环顾四周的时候，他们除了耶稣谁也没有看见。

As they went back down the mountain, Jesus said, “Do not tell anyone about what happened here until after I have been raised from the dead.”他们下山的时候，耶稣说，“直到我从死里复活之前，不要告诉其他人在山上发生的事情。”
