One day, a lawyer came to Jesus to test him, saying, “Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?” Jesus answered, “What is written in God’s law?”一天，一个律师来到耶稣面前试探他，说：“老师，我怎样才能长生不老呢？”耶稣回答说：“圣经里面怎么说的呢？”

“Love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, strength, and mind. And love your neighbor as yourself,” the lawyer said. Jesus answered, “You are correct! Do this and you will live.” “用尽你所有的心思，灵魂，力量和思想爱你的主，并且爱你的邻居像爱自己一样”律师说道，耶稣说：“完全正确，你可以照着经上说的去做。”

But the lawyer wanted to prove that he was right, so he asked, “Who is my neighbor?”但是律师想要证明自己才是对的，他又问道’谁是我的邻居呢？

Jesus answered with a story. “There was a Jewish man who was traveling along the road from Jerusalem to Jericho.”耶稣用一个故事回答了他的疑问。“曾经有一个犹太人，她从耶路撒冷去往杰利科”

“While he was traveling, he was attacked by a group of robbers. They took everything he had and beat him until he was almost dead. Then they went away.”在路途中，他遭遇了一群强盗的打劫。他们将他洗劫一空，并且毒打一顿之后逃之夭夭。

“Soon after that, a Jewish priest happened to walk down that same road. When this religious leader saw the man who had been robbed and beaten, he moved to the other side of the road, ignored the man in need, and kept on going.”不一会儿，一个犹太牧师碰巧路过这条路。当这个宗教领袖看见那个被打劫的人躺在路边时，他完全无视这个可怜人，仍然继续走自己的。

“Not long after that, a Levite came down the road. (Levites were a tribe of Jews who helped the priests at the Temple.) The Levite also crossed over to the other side of the road and ignored the man who had been robbed and beaten.”没过多久，一个利未人也经过这条路。（利未是犹太的一个部落，他们在圣殿帮助牧师们。）利未人同样走在道路的另一侧，无视这个遭遇打劫和毒打的可怜人。

“The next person to walk down that road was a Samaritan. (Samaritans were the descendants of Jews and people from other nations. Samaritans and Jews hated each other.) When the Samaritan saw the man, he was filled with compassion. He cared for him and bandaged his wounds.”下一位路过的是一个撒玛利亚人。(撒玛利亚人是犹太族和其它民族的后裔。撒玛利亚人和犹太人曾经互相憎恨彼此。）当撒玛利亚人看见这个人时，他充满了同情，怜悯。他细心照顾他，并且为他包扎伤口。

“The Samaritan then lifted the man onto his own donkey and took him to a hotel where he took care of him.”撒玛利亚人将他抬到自己的驴上 ，把他带到客栈照料他。

“The next day, the Samaritan needed to continue his journey. He gave the person in charge of the hotel some money and said, ‘Take care of him, and if any extra money is spent, I will repay those expenses when I return.’”次日，撒玛利亚人需要继续赶路。他给了客栈的主人一些钱，说道：“请照料他，如果花了多余的钱，我回来的时候会再支付给你。‘

Then Jesus asked the lawyer, “Which one of the three men do you think was a neighbor to the man who was robbed and beaten?” The lawyer replied, “The one who showed mercy.” Jesus told the lawyer, “You go and do the same thing.”耶稣问律师：“你认为，对于一个遭遇打劫和毒打的人来说，这三个人之中谁才是自己的邻居呢？”律师回答说：“那个有仁慈的撒玛利亚人。”耶稣说，“你也可以去做同样的事情。”
