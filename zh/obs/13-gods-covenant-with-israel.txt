在带领以色列人穿过红海后，神又带领他们穿过旷野，来到了一座名叫西奈的山下。人们在山下安营扎寨。After God led the Israelites through the Red Sea, He led them through the wilderness to a mountain called Sinai. The people set up their tents at the base of the mountain.

神对摩西以及以色列的民说，“你们若听我的话，守我的约，就是我贵重的产业，祭祀的王国，神圣的国度。God said to Moses and the people of Israel, “If you will obey My voice and keep My covenant, you will be My prized possession, a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation.”

三天后，人们做好了准备，神便降临到西奈山顶，伴随着电闪雷鸣，和极大的吹号角声。只有摩西被准许到山上去。Three days later, after the people had prepared themselves, God came down on top of Mount Sinai with thunder, lightning, smoke, and a loud trumpet blast. Only Moses was allowed to go up the mountain.

神给了他们约，并说道，“我是你的神你的主，将你从埃及地救出来的。不要侍奉别的神。”Then God gave them the covenant and said, “I am the LORD your God, who saved you from slavery in Egypt. Do not worship other gods.”

“不要制作偶像，也不要敬拜他们。因为我，你的神你的主，是妒忌的神。不要亵渎你神的名。记住要守安息圣日。在六日内做完所有的工，而第七日是要用来休息，以纪念你的神。“Do not make idols or worship them, for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God. Do not use God’s name in a disrespectful way. Remember to keep the Sabbath day holy. Do all your work in six days, for the seventh day is a day of rest to remember the LORD.”

“尊敬你的父母。不可杀人。不可奸淫。不可偷盗。不可说谎。不可贪图邻居的妻子，房子，或任何属于他的东西。
“Honor your father and your mother. Do not murder. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not lie. Do not wish you had your neighbor’s wife, his house, or anything that belongs to him.”

神在石板上写下了这十诫，并把它们给了摩西。神也给了很多其它需遵守的条例。只要人们遵守这些条例，神应许会祝福并保护他们。但如果人们不遵守这些条例，神就要惩罚他们。Then God wrote these Ten Commandments on two stone tablets and gave them to Moses. God also gave many other laws and rules to follow. If the people obeyed these laws, God promised that He would bless and protect them. If they disobeyed them, God would punish them.

为了让以色列人造出合他心意的帐幕，神给了他们一套详细的指示。那帐幕被称为会幕。会幕有两个房间，用一个很大的帘子隔开。除了大祭司，没有人可以进入到帘子后面的房间，因为神住在那里。God gave the Israelites a detailed description of a tent He wanted them to make. It was called the Tent of Meeting. The Tent of Meeting had two rooms, separated by a large curtain. No one could enter the room behind the curtain except the high priest, because God lived there.

如果有人违反了神的律例，他可以带一个动物到会幕里作为祭物献给神。有祭祀会在祭坛上杀掉并焚烧这个动物。祭物的血将掩盖那个人的罪，使他在神的眼里得以清洁。神选了亚伦，也就是摩西的哥哥，和他的后代作为祭司。Anyone who disobeyed God’s law could bring an animal to the Tent of Meeting to sacrifice to God. A priest would kill the animal and burn it on the altar. The blood of the sacrifice covered the person’s sin and made them clean in God’s sight. God chose Aaron, Moses’ brother, and his descendants to be His priests.

人们都愿意遵守神赐给他们的律例，只敬拜神，成为神的选民。但仅仅在承诺顺服神之后不久，他们就犯了很大的罪。The people all agreed to obey the laws that God had given them, to worship only God, and to be His special people. But a short time after they promised to obey God, they sinned terribly.

{{:en:obs:obs-13-11.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

摩西在西奈山上很多天，和神说话。人们厌倦了等待他归来。所以他们把金子带到亚伦面前，让他为他们造一个偶像！For many days, Moses was on top of Mount Sinai talking with God. The people became tired of waiting for him to return. So they brought gold to Aaron and asked him to make an idol for them!

{{:en:obs:obs-13-12.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

亚伦造了一个牛形的偶像。人们开始大肆的向偶像敬拜和献祭。神对他们犯的罪非常愤怒，想要除灭他们。摩西却为他们祷告，神聆听了他的祷告，没有除灭他们。Aaron made a golden idol in the shape of a calf. The people began to wildly worship and sacrifice to the idol! God was very angry with their sin and planned to destroy them. But Moses prayed for them, and God listened to his prayer and did not destroy them.

{{:en:obs:obs-13-13.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

当摩西下山看到那尊偶像，非常愤怒。他摔碎了那写上了神的十诫的石板。When Moses came down the mountain and saw the idol, he was so angry that he smashed the stones on which God had written the Ten Commandments.

{{:en:obs:obs-13-14.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

他将偶像击成粉末，然后将粉末放在水里，让人们喝。神降灾到人群中，很多人死去。Then he beat the idol into powder, threw the powder into some water and made the people drink the water. God sent a plague on the people and many of them died.

{{:en:obs:obs-13-15.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

摩西再次上山，向神祷告，求神原谅他的民。神听了摩西的祷告，原谅了他们。摩西在新的石板上写上十诫，以替换之前损毁的石板。接下来，神便带领以色列人离开西奈山，向应许之地前进。Then Moses climbed the mountain again and prayed that God would forgive the people. God listened to Moses and forgave them. Moses wrote the Ten Commandments on new stone tablets to replace the ones he had broken. Then God led the Israelites away from Mount Sinai toward the Promised Land.
