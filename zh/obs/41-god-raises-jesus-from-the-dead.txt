After Jesus was crucified, the unbelieving Jewish leaders said to Pilate, “That liar, Jesus, said he would rise from the dead after three days. The tomb must be guarded so that his disciples do not steal the body and then say he has risen from the dead.”
耶稣被钉死十字架后，一些不信的犹太人领袖对彼拉多说：“这个骗子耶稣曾说要在三天后复活。这墓一定要看好，免得他的门徒偷走他的尸体说他死里复活了。”

Pilate said, “Make the tomb as secure as you can.” So they sealed the stone at the entrance of the tomb and put soldiers there to make sure no one could steal the body.
彼拉多说：“你们要看好墓。”于是他们把墓口用石头封住了，并派士兵在那看守确保没有人来偷耶稣的尸身。

The day after Jesus was buried was a Sabbath, a day of rest. Very early on the morning after the Sabbath, several women went to Jesus’ tomb to put more burial spices on his body.
耶稣埋葬的那一日是安息日。安息日之后的一天早晨，几个妇人来到耶稣的墓边，想用香料膏抹耶稣。

There was a great earthquake. An angel of the Lord appeared from heaven, as bright as lightning. He rolled away the stone that was covering the entrance to the tomb and sat on it. The soldiers guarding the tomb were terrified and fell to the ground like dead men.
地有震动。一个天使从天上下来，犹如光一样明亮。他把墓口的石头滚开，坐在上面。看守墓的士兵吓呆了，跌倒在地上，和死人一样。

The angel told the women, “Do not be afraid. Jesus is not here. He has risen from the dead, just like he said he would! Look in the tomb and see.” The women looked into the tomb and saw where Jesus had been lying. His body was not there!
天使对妇女说：“不要害怕。耶稣不在这里。他已经从死里复活了，正如他所说的那样。看看这墓。”妇女们朝里面看了看，之前安放耶稣的地方已经不见他的尸身了。

Then the angel told the women, “Tell the disciples that Jesus has risen from the dead and is going before you into Galilee.”
天使对妇女们说：“去告诉耶稣的门徒，耶稣已从死里复活，并且在你们以先往加利利去了。”

妇女们又是害怕又是惊喜，跑去报给门徒这个好消息。

On the way, Jesus appeared to them, and they worshiped him. Jesus said, “Do not be afraid. Go and tell my disciples that I will see them in Galilee.”
路上，耶稣向他们显现，他们就敬拜他。耶稣说：“不要害怕。去告诉我的门徒我将要在加利利见他们。”
