The nations of Israel and Judah both sinned against God. They broke the Covenant that God made with them at Mount Sinai. God sent His prophets to warn them to repent and worship Him again, but they refused to listen.以色列族和犹大族都对上帝犯了罪。他们打破了曾经和上帝在西奈山所定下的契约。上帝派遣先知来警告他们，使他们重新敬拜神，可是他们不听上帝的警告。

So God punished both nations by allowing them to be destroyed. Israel was destroyed by the Assyrian Empire, a powerful, cruel nation. The Assyrians killed many Israelites, took away everything of value, and burned much of the country.所以神惩罚了以色列人和犹大人，上帝让他们被其它名族摧毁。以色列被一个强大而残酷的亚述族打败。亚述人杀死很多以色列人，掳走他们所有财物，并且几乎烧毁他们的国家。

The Assyrians gathered all the leaders, the rich people, and the people with skills and took them to Assyria. Only the very poor Israelites who had not been killed remained in Israel.亚述人将他们中的领袖、富人、还有一些有技能的人聚集在一起，统统带到亚述国去。剩下的只有那些幸存的穷人留在以色列。

Then the Assyrians brought foreigners to live in Israel. The foreigners rebuilt the destroyed cities and married the Israelites who were left there. Their descendants were called Samaritans.后来亚述人带别国居民定居于以色列。这些外国人重建了以色列，还和剩余的以色列人通婚。他们的后裔被称为撒玛利亚人。

The people in the kingdom of Judah saw how God had punished the kingdom of Israel for not believing and obeying Him. But they still worshiped idols and the gods of the Canaanites. God sent prophets to warn them, but they refused to listen.犹大人亲眼看见神因为以色列族背叛上帝而惩罚他们。但是他们仍然拜偶像，仍然相信迦南人的神。即使上帝派遣先知警告他们，他们也不听。

About 100 years after the Assyrians destroyed Israel, God sent Nebuchadnezzar, king of the Babylonians, to attack Judah. Babylon was a powerful empire. The king of Judah agreed to be Nebuchadnezzar’s servant and pay him lots of money every year.大约在亚述国摧毁以色列国后一百年，上帝派巴比伦国王尼布甲尼撒去攻打犹大国。巴比伦是一个强大的帝国。犹大国王同意作尼布甲尼撒的仆人，并且每年缴纳巨额钱财给他。

But soon the people of Judah rebelled against the Babylonians. So, the Babylonians came back and attacked them. They captured the city of Jerusalem, destroyed the Temple, and took away all the treasures.但是很快的犹大人民反叛巴比伦国。所以巴比伦人又攻击他们。他们占领耶路撒冷圣城，摧毁他们的神殿，掳走他们所有的财物。

To punish Judah’s king for rebelling, Nebuchadnezzar’s soldiers killed the king’s sons in front of him and then made him blind. After that, they took the king away to die in prison in Babylon.为了惩罚犹大国王的背叛，尼布甲尼撒的士兵当着他的面杀害了他的亲生子还弄瞎了他的双眼。之后他们将犹大国王囚禁于巴比伦监狱中，直到死去。

Nebuchadnezzar and his army took all the people of Judah to Babylon, leaving only the poorest people behind to plant the fields. This is called the Exile.尼布甲尼撒和他的军队将犹大国的所有人带到巴比伦，只留下最穷困的一些人种植庄稼。这就是所谓的放逐。

Even though the Exile was punishment for their sin, God did not forget His people or His promises. God watched over His people and spoke to them through His prophets. He promised that, after seventy years, they would return to the Promised Land again.尽管他们因着罪被放逐，上帝并没有忘记他的民和他的应许。上帝眷顾他的子民并且派先知和他们说话。上帝答应70年后，会让他们重新回到应许之地。

About seventy years later, Cyrus, the king of the Persians, defeated Babylon. The Persians were a strong but merciful people. The Israelites were now called Jews and most of them had lived their whole lives in Babylon. Only a few very old Jews even remembered the land of Judah.大约70年后，波斯国王塞勒斯打败了巴比伦帝国。波斯是一个强大而仁慈的帝国。这时候的以色列人被称为犹太人，他们中的大多数都在巴比伦度过一生。只有为数不多的老年人还记得犹大国得故土。

Shortly after Cyrus came to power, he did something that had never been done before in history. He gave an order that any Jew who wanted to return to Judah could go. He even gave them money to rebuild the Temple! After seventy years in exile, a small group of Jews returned to Jerusalem.塞勒斯执政不久，他就做了一件在历史上绝无仅有的壮举。他颁布一条法令：犹太人可以自由重返自己的犹大国故土。他甚至出资让犹太人重建神殿。被放逐了70年后，一小群的犹太人返回到耶路撒冷城。

When they arrived, they rebuilt the Temple and the wall around the city of Jerusalem. Although they were still ruled by other people, they lived in the Promised Land again and worshiped at the Temple.到了以后，他们重建神殿，重修耶路撒冷城墙。尽管他们仍然受别人控制，但是他们重回应许之地，并且在神殿敬拜自己的上帝。
