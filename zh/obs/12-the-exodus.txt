以色列人因可以离开埃及而感到愉快。他们从此不再被奴役，而可以前往应许之地。埃及人送给以色列人一些金子，银子以及其他贵重的物品。一些埃及人信了神以后也加入了，与他们一起离开了埃及。The Israelites were very happy to leave Egypt. They were no longer slaves, and they were going to the Promised Land! The Egyptians gave the Israelites gifts of gold and silver and other valuable things. Some Egyptians believed in God and joined the Israelites as they left Egypt.

神在白天以高大的云柱引领他们，到了晚上就变成了火柱。在他们的行进中神一直与他们同在并且引领他们。他们所要做的就是跟从。God led them by going ahead of them as a tall cloud pillar during the day, which became a tall fire pillar at night. God was always with them and guided them as they traveled. All they had to do was follow.

过了不久，法老和他的人民改变了主意，希望以色列人可以继续被他们奴役。神这样做是要在法老和他的军队上得荣耀，埃及人就知道祂是大而可畏的神了。After a short time, Pharaoh and his people changed their minds and wanted the Israelites to be their slaves again. God did this to get glory for Himself by showing that He is more powerful than Pharaoh and his gods.

所以法老和他的军队就追赶以色列人，使他们继续做奴隶。当以色列看见埃及军队正在临近，发现自己身陷敌军和红海之间，就非常得害怕，哭喊道：“我们为什么要离开埃及啊？我们会死在这里啊!"So Pharaoh and his army chased after the Israelites to make them their slaves again. When the Israelites saw the Egyptian army coming, they realized they were trapped between Pharaoh’s army and the Red Sea. They were very afraid and cried out, “Why did we leave Egypt? We are going to die!”

摩西告诉百姓”不要害怕！神今天会为我们争战，拯救我们。”神告诉摩西“告诉百姓，让他们向红海走去。”Moses told the people, “Do not be afraid! God will fight for you today and save you.” Then God told Moses, “Tell the people to move toward the Red Sea.”

此时，云柱就转到以色列人和埃及人中间。埃及人就看不到以色列人了。The cloud pillar then moved between the Israelites and the Egyptians so the Egyptians could not see the Israelites.

摩西举起手来，神就使风刮起，大风就将海里的水分向左右两边，从中间开辟了一条道路。Moses lifted his hand over the sea, and God caused the wind to blow. The wind made the water in the sea separate to the left and the right, making a path through the sea.

以色列人就在海中的干地里行走，水在两边作了墙。The Israelites marched through the sea on dry ground with a wall of water on either side of them.

云柱升起，埃及人看到以色列人逃走了。他们决定追赶。Then the cloud lifted and the Egyptians saw the Israelites escaping. They decided to chase after them.

因此，他们随以色列人也下了红海，走在那条干路上。但是神使埃及人产生混乱，他们就大喊道：“逃跑吧！因为耶和华在为以色列人攻打我们。So they followed the Israelites onto the path through the sea, but God threw the Egyptians into a panic and caused their chariots to get stuck. They shouted, “Run away! God is fighting for the Israelites!”


{{:en:obs:obs-12-11.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


After the Israelites all made it safely to the other side, God told Moses to stretch out his hand again. When he obeyed, the water fell on the Egyptian army and returned to its normal place. The whole Egyptian army drowned.


{{:en:obs:obs-12-12.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


When the Israelites saw that the Egyptians were dead, they believed in God and trusted that Moses was a prophet of God.


{{:en:obs:obs-12-13.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


They also rejoiced with much excitement because God had saved them from death and slavery! Now they were free to serve God. The Israelites sang many songs to celebrate their new freedom and to praise God for saving them.


{{:en:obs:obs-12-14.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


God commanded the Israelites to remember His victory over the Egyptians and their deliverance from slavery by celebrating the Passover Feast every year. They celebrated by killing a perfect lamb, having a big feast, and telling the story of how God had saved them from the Egyptians.
