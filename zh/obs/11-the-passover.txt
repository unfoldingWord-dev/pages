神警告法老，如果他不让以色列人离开，神将杀掉埃及所有头生的人和动物。法老听到这些后仍然拒绝相信神。God warned Pharaoh that if he did not let the Israelites go, then He would kill all the firstborn males of both people and animals. When Pharaoh heard this he still refused to believe God.

神给所有相信他的人一个方法来拯救他们家所有头生的人和动物。每个家庭要选出一只无残疾的山羊或绵羊，并且杀掉它。God provided a way to save the firstborn of anyone who believed in Him. Each family had to choose a perfect lamb or goat and kill it.

他们要在自己家房屋的门框和门楣上涂上一些血。他们要烤了羊肉，并同无酵饼一起吃。他们吃的时候就要准备好离开埃及。Then they needed to put some of its blood around the door of their house. They were to roast the meat and eat it as a feast, along with bread that was made without yeast. They were to be ready to leave Egypt when they ate.

以色列人做了神命令他们当做的事。那天晚上，神的使者遍行埃及，杀了埃及所有头生的。The Israelites did everything just as God had commanded them. That night the angel of God went throughout Egypt killing every firstborn son.

所有门框和门楣上有血的房子，神的使者就越过它们。在这些房子里面的人都是安全的。他们都因为羊羔的血而得救了。All the houses of the Israelites had blood around the doors, so the angel of God passed over those houses and everybody inside was safe. They were saved because of the lamb’s blood.

但是埃及人不相信神，也不遵守他的命令。所以神的使者没有越过他们的房子，杀掉了所有埃及人头生的儿子和牲畜。But the Egyptians did not believe God or obey His commands. So the angel of God did not pass over their houses. The angel of God killed every firstborn son in Egypt.

从罪犯的头生的儿子，到法老头生的儿子，每个头生的，都被杀了。在埃及地有大哀哭。From the firstborn of the prisoner in jail, to the firstborn of Pharaoh, every firstborn died. There was much weeping in Egypt.

法老接来摩西和亚伦，告诉他们：“让以色列人立刻离开埃及！”埃及人也催促以色列人赶紧离开埃及。Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron and said, “Take the Israelites and leave Egypt immediately!” The Egyptians encouraged the Israelites to leave right away.
