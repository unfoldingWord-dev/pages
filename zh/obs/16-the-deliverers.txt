After Joshua died, the Israelites disobeyed God and did not drive out the rest of the Canaanites or obey God’s laws. The Israelites began to worship the Canaanite gods instead of the One True God. The Israelites had no king, so everyone did what they thought was right for them. 约书亚死后，以色列人又不顺服神，他们不再驱赶迦南人，也没有遵守上帝的律法。以色列人开始崇拜迦南人的神，放弃了唯一的真神。以色列人没有国王，所以他们为所欲为。

As a result of this disobedience, God punished the Israelites by allowing them to be defeated by their enemies. These enemies stole from the Israelites, destroyed their property, and killed many of them. After many years, the Israelites repented and asked God to rescue them.因为他们违背神的旨意，上帝不断派遣他们的敌人来攻打他们，以此作为惩罚。这些敌人偷盗他们，毁坏他们的财物，还杀了很多以色列人。多年以后，以色列人忏悔所犯的罪过并且祈求上帝来拯救他们。

Then God provided a deliverer who rescued them from their enemies and brought peace to the land. But then the people forgot about God and started worshiping idols again. So God allowed the Midianites, a nearby enemy tribe, to defeat them.于是上帝派遣了一位士师，使他们脱离了敌人的攻打，重新回到了和平，安宁的生活。但是他们随后又忘记了上帝的恩典，再次崇拜偶像。所以上帝让处于他们周边的米甸部落将他们打败。

They took all of the Israelites’ crops for seven years. The Israelites were so scared, they hid in caves so the Midianites would not find them. Finally, they cried out to God to save them.米甸人连续七年掳走以色列人的粮食。他们十分害怕，为了不被米甸人发现，他们躲进了洞穴。最终，他们大声呼叫上帝来拯救他们。

One day, a man named Gideon was secretly harvesting grain so the Midianites would not steal it. The angel of God came to Gideon and said, “God is with you, mighty warrior. Go and save Israel from the Midianites.”一天，一个叫吉迪恩的勇士暗中收割谷物，防止米甸人过来盗窃。上帝的使者对他说“上帝与你同在，坚强的勇士。去拯救以色列人吧。"

God told Gideon to tear down his father’s idol. Gideon was afraid of the people, so he waited until nighttime. Then he tore down the idol and smashed it to pieces. He built an altar to God where the idol used to be and made a sacrifice to God. 上帝让吉迪恩去摧毁他父亲的偶像。吉迪恩怕众人反对，于是等到夜间才行动。他摧毁了曾经的偶像，重新给上帝建了一座圣坛，并且向上帝献祭。

The next morning the people saw that the idol had been torn down, and they were very angry. They went to Gideon’s house to kill him, but Gideon’s father said, “Why are you trying to help your gods? If they are gods, let them protect themselves!” So Gideon was saved.次日早晨，人们看见偶像被摧毁，于是十分生气。他们来到吉迪恩家中，想要杀死他。但是吉迪恩的父亲说:" 你们为什么企图拯救你们的神呢？如果他们真是上帝，那就让他们自己拯救自己吧！最后，吉迪恩获救了。

Then the Midianites came again to steal from the Israelites. There were so many of them that they could not be counted. Gideon called the Israelites together to fight them. Gideon asked God for two signs so he could be sure that God would use him to save Israel.后来米甸人又来盗窃以色列人。米甸人数量之多，数不胜数。吉迪恩号召以色列人同心协力起来反抗。吉迪恩请求上帝给了两个暗示，以此确保上帝是派遣他来拯救以色列民的。

First, he laid a cloth on the ground and asked God to let the morning dew fall only on the cloth and not on the ground. God did that. The next night, he asked that the ground be wet but the cloth dry. God did that too.首先他在地上铺了一块布，求上帝使清晨的露珠单单落在这布上。上帝成全了。次日晚上，他请求上帝使地面潮湿，唯有布是干的。上帝也成全了。

32,000 Israelite soldiers came to Gideon, but God told him this was too many. So Gideon sent home 22,000 who were too scared to fight. God told Gideon that he still had too many men. So Gideon sent all of them home except for 300 soldiers.32000名以色列人来跟随吉迪恩，但是上帝说人数太多了。于是吉迪恩打发了22000个惧怕战斗的人回家。上帝告诉他人数仍然很多。所以吉迪恩最后只留下300名战士。

That night God told Gideon, “Go down to the Midianite camp and when you hear what they say, you will no longer be afraid.” So that night, Gideon went down to the camp and heard a Midianite soldier telling his friend about a dream. The man’s friend said, “This dream means that Gideon will defeat Midian!” Gideon worshiped God.当天晚上上帝对吉迪恩说：”去到米甸人的军营听听他们如何说，之后你便不会惧怕了。“所以吉迪恩去了去了米甸人的军营，听到一个米甸士兵在和他的朋友说一个梦。他的朋友说，这个梦预示着吉迪恩将会大败米甸。吉迪恩敬拜了大能的主。

Then Gideon returned to his soldiers and gave each of them a horn, a clay pot, and a torch. They surrounded the place where the Midianites were sleeping. The 300 men had the torches in the pots so they could not be seen.后来，吉迪恩来到以色列士兵那里，给每个人发了号角，粘土锅还有一个火炬。他们趁米甸人睡觉的时候将他们包围了。这300个人将火炬统统放入锅中，这样就没有人看到他们了。


{{:en:obs:obs-16-13.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Then, at the same time, they all broke the pots that were hiding the torches. They blew their horns and shouted, “A sword for God and for Gideon!”与此同时，他们将藏着火炬的粘土锅打碎。他们吹响号角，大声呼喊“为上帝而战，为吉迪恩而战！”

God confused the Midianites, so that they attacked each other and started killing each other. Immediately, the rest of the Israelites were called from their homes to come help chase the Midianites. They killed many of them and chased the rest of them out of their land. 120,000 Midianites died that day. God had saved Israel.上帝迷惑了米甸人，于是他们彼此攻击，互相残杀。他们杀害了很多自己人，还将剩余的人赶出他们的土地。120000米甸人死了，上帝拯救了以色列人。

The people wanted to make Gideon their king. Gideon wisely refused their offer, but he asked them for some of the money that each of them had taken from the enemy. Gideon received a lot of money.以色列人想要使吉迪恩成为他们的王。吉迪恩聪明的拒绝了他们的请求。但是吉迪恩向他们要了一些从敌人那里获得的金钱。吉迪恩得到了一大笔钱。


{{:en:obs:obs-16-16.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Then Gideon did a foolish thing. He made an idol with the money, and the people turned away from God again. They started worshiping Gideon’s idol.吉迪恩做了一件愚蠢的事情。他将金钱视为偶像，于是人们再一次远离上帝。他们开始拜吉迪恩为偶像。


{{:en:obs:obs-16-17.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


God punished Israel again for worshiping idols. Their enemies defeated them. They finally asked God for help, and God sent them another deliverer. This pattern of sin, punishment, repentance, and deliverance was repeated many times. God sent many deliverers who saved Israel from their enemies.上帝再一次因以色列人拜偶像而惩罚他们。他们被敌人打败。最后去求上帝，上帝派遣另外一个士师。这种犯罪，惩罚，忏悔，士师的模式一次次重复着。上帝派遣了很多士师，他们拯救以色列人，摆脱了敌人。


{{:en:obs:obs-16-18.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Finally, the people asked God for a king like all the other nations had. They wanted a king who was tall, strong, and could lead them into battle. God did not like this request, but He gave them what they wanted.最后，以色列人也想和其它名族一样拥有自己的国王。他们想要一个高大强壮，能够带领他们的国王。上帝并不月喜欢这个请求。但他还是应许他们，为他们设立了国王。
