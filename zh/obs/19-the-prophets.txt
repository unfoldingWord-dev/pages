Throughout the history of the Israelites, God sent them prophets. The prophets heard messages from God and then told the people God’s messages.综观以色列人的历史，神一直在向他们差派先知。先知可以听到来自神的信息并将这些信息传给以色列人。

Elijah was a prophet when Ahab was king over Israel. Ahab was an evil man who encouraged people to worship a false god named Baal. Elijah said to Ahab, “There will be no rain or dew in Israel until I say so.“亚哈作以色列王的时候，以利亚是先知。亚哈很邪恶，他鼓励民众去敬拜假神巴力。以利亚对亚哈说，“除非我祈求，否则以色列全地就不会下一滴雨。”

Then God told Elijah to hide in the wilderness near a stream. Every morning and every evening, birds would bring him bread and meat. Ahab and his army looked for Elijah, but they could not find him. The drought was so severe that the stream eventually dried up.神让以利亚藏在一条小溪旁的野地里。每天早晚，有鸟儿为他衔来饼和肉。亚哈和他的军队寻找以利亚，却找不到。

So Elijah went to a neighboring country. A widow and her son had almost run out of food because of the famine. But they took care of Elijah, and God provided so that neither their flour jar nor their bottle of oil ever ran out. They had food through the whole famine. Elijah stayed there a long time.以利亚去了邻国。一个寡妇带着他的儿子，快要没有食物了，因为地大旱。但他们照顾以利亚，而神供应他们，以至于他们的粮罐和油瓶充充足足。在整个大饥荒，他们都有足够的食物。以利亚在那里待了很久。

After three years, God told Elijah to return to Israel and speak with Ahab because He was going to send rain again. When Ahab saw Elijah he said, “There you are, you troublemaker!” Elijah said, “You are the troublemaker! You have abandoned the true God and worshiped Baal. Bring all of Israel to Mount Carmel.”三年后，神让以利亚回到以色列并与亚哈说话，因为他将再次降雨。亚哈见到以利亚的时候说，“你这个闹事者在这呢。”以利亚说，“你才是闹事者呢！你背弃了真神，却去拜巴力。把以色列人都带到迦密山来！”

All of Israel, including the 400 prophets of Baal, came to Mount Carmel. Elijah said, “How long will you keep changing your mind? If the LORD is God, serve Him! If Baal is God, serve him!”所有的以色列人，包括400个拜巴力的先知，都来到了迦密山。以利亚说，“你们多久才会改变心意呢？如果主是神，你们就拜主，如果巴力是神，你们就拜巴力！”

Then he said to the prophets of Baal, “Kill a bull and prepare a sacrifice, but do not light the fire. I will do the same. The God who answers with fire is the real God.” So the priests of Baal prepared a sacrifice but did not light the fire.他对巴力的先知们说，“杀掉一头牛，准备一个祭品，但不要生火。我也这样做。哪位神能用火回答，这位神就是真神。”巴力的祭司便准备了祭品，但是没有生火。

Then they prayed to Baal, “Hear us, O Baal!” All day long they prayed and shouted and even cut themselves with knives, but Baal did not answer.他们向巴力祈求说，“巴力啊，听我们！”他们祈求呼喊了一整天，甚至用刀割自己的身体，巴力也没有回应。

At the end of the day, Elijah prepared a sacrifice to God. Then he had twelve huge pots of water poured on top of the sacrifice until the meat, the wood, and even the ground around the altar was completely wet.天将晚，以利亚为神准备了一份祭品。然后他用12大锅的水浇在祭品上，直到整个祭品，木头，甚至祭坛周边的地面全都潮湿了。


{{:en:obs:obs-19-10.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Then Elijah prayed, “O LORD, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, show us today that You are the God of Israel and that I am Your servant. Answer me so that these people will know that You are God.”以利亚接着祷告道，“哦我的主啊，亚伯拉罕，以撒，雅各的神，向我们显示你是以色列的神，而我是你的仆人。请回答我，好叫这些人直到你就是神。”


{{:en:obs:obs-19-11.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Immediately, fire fell from the sky and burned up the meat, the wood, the rocks, and even the wet ground around the altar. When the people saw this, they fell on the ground and said, “The LORD is God! The LORD is God!”立刻，火从天上降下，烧着了祭品，木头，岩石，甚至祭坛周围的地面。人们看到这些，纷纷跪在地上说，“主是神！主是神！”


{{:en:obs:obs-19-12.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Then Elijah said, “Do not let any of the prophets of Baal escape!” So the people captured the prophets of Baal. Then Elijah took them away and killed them.以利亚接着说，“不要让拜巴力的先知跑掉！”人们抓住拜巴力的先知。以利亚把他们带走并杀了他们。

Then Elijah said to King Ahab, “Return immediately to the city, for the rain is coming.” Soon the sky grew black, and a large rain storm came. God had ended the drought and proved that He is the only God.以利亚对亚哈说，“速速回城，雨要降下来了。”不久，天就变黑了，大雨降下。神结束了大旱并证明了他是唯一的真神。

After Elijah, God chose Elisha to be His prophet. God did many miracles through Elisha. One time, Naaman, an enemy commander, found out he had a horrible skin disease called leprosy. He had heard of Elisha so he went and asked Elisha to be healed. Elisha told him to dip himself seven times in the Jordan River.以利亚以后，神拣选了以利沙作先知。神通过以利沙行了很多神迹。一次，一个叫乃缦的敌军元帅，发现自己得了一种叫大麻疯的皮肤病。他听说过以利沙，于是他去见以利沙，求他医治。以利沙让他将自己浸到约旦河里7次。


{{:en:obs:obs-19-15.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


At first Naaman was angry and would not do it. But later he changed his mind and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan River. When he came up the last time, his skin was completely healed! God had healed him.起初，乃缦很生气，不愿这样做。但是后来，他改变心意，将自己7次浸到约旦河里。当他最后一次从约旦河里出来时，他的皮肤被完全治愈了。神使他痊愈。


{{:en:obs:obs-19-16.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


There were many other prophets. They all told the people to stop worshiping idols and to start showing justice and mercy. The prophets warned the people that if they did not turn from their sins and start living obedient lives, then God’s judgment would come, and He would punish them.有许多其他的先知。他们都告诉人们停止敬拜偶像并显示公义和怜悯。先知们警告人们如果他们不从罪里回头，过上顺服的生命，神的审判就要来临，他将要惩罚他们。


{{:en:obs:obs-19-17.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Most of the time, the people did not listen. They often mistreated the prophets and sometimes even killed them. Once, the prophet Jeremiah was put into a dry well and left there to die. He sank down into the mud that was in the bottom of the well, but then the king had mercy on him and pulled him out before he died.大多数时候，人们不会听先知的话。他们经常虐待先知，甚至会杀掉他们。有一次，先知耶利米被丢到一口枯井里等死。他沉到井底的泥里，但是国王怜悯他，在他快死之前将他拉了出来。


{{:en:obs:obs-19-18.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Even though the prophets were hated, they continued to speak for God. They warned people that they would be destroyed if they did not repent. They also reminded people of the promise that God’s Messiah would come.尽管先知们被人们厌恶，他们仍然为神说话。他们警告人们如果不悔改，他们就要被毁灭。他们也提醒人们神应许的弥赛亚将要来到。
