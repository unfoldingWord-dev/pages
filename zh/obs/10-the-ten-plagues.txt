摩西和亚伦去见法老。他们说：“以色列的神这样说，'让我的民离开埃及!'”法老嘲笑他们。他不仅没有让以色列人离开，还加给他们更繁重的工作。Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh. They said, “This is what the God of Israel says, ‘Let my people go!’” Pharaoh laughed at them. Instead of letting the Israelites go free, he made their work even harder!

因为法老一直拒绝让以色列民离开埃及，于是神就在埃及地降下了十灾。通过这些灾祸，神让法老明白他比法老及埃及所有的神都要伟大。Pharaoh kept refusing to let the people go, so God sent ten plagues on Egypt. (A plague is a terrible disaster.) Through these plagues, God showed Pharaoh that He is more powerful than Pharaoh and all of Egypt’s gods.

神让尼罗河水变为血水，但法老仍不愿让以色列人离开。God turned the Nile River into blood, but Pharaoh still would not let the Israelites go.

神让埃及全地遍布青蛙。法老求摩西把青蛙变走。但是在青蛙都死掉之后，法老的心又刚硬，不愿让以色列人离开。God sent frogs all over Egypt. Pharaoh begged Moses to take away the frogs. But after all the frogs died, Pharaoh hardened his heart and would not let the Israelites go.

神又降下虱灾和蝇灾。法老召来摩西和亚伦，告诉他们如果能停止这些灾祸，以色列人就可以离开。于是摩西向神祷告，神从埃及地移走了所有的苍蝇。但是法老的心又变得刚硬，不愿让以色列人离开。So God sent a plague of gnats and then a plague of flies. Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron and told them they could leave if they stopped the plague. Moses prayed, and God removed all the flies from Egypt, but Pharaoh hardened his heart and would not let the people go.

接下来，神降下疾病，杀掉了所有属于埃及人的牲畜。法老的心很刚硬，不愿让以色列人离开。Next God sent a sickness to kill all the farm animals that belonged to the Egyptians. Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he would not let the Israelites go.

然后，神让摩西在法老面前扬起炉灰。当他做完这件事，埃及人的皮肤上就出现了很多疮，但是以色列人身上没有。神让法老的心刚硬，他仍然不愿意让以色列人离开埃及。Then God told Moses to throw ashes into the air in front of Pharaoh. When he did, painful skin sores appeared on the Egyptians, but not on the Israelites. God hardened Pharaoh's heart, and Pharaoh would not let the Israelites go free.

在那之后，神降下冰雹，毁坏埃及人的种的菜蔬，砸死任何在户外的人。法老召来摩西和亚伦，对他们说，“我犯罪了，你们可以离开。”于是摩西向神祷告，雹灾就停止了。After that, God sent hail that destroyed the crops in Egypt and killed anybody who went outside. Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron and told them, “I have sinned. You may go.” So Moses prayed, and the hail stopped.

但是法老又犯罪，心里刚硬，不愿让以色列人离开。But Pharaoh sinned again and hardened his heart and would not let the Israelites go.

神使一大群蝗虫覆盖全埃及地。这些蝗虫吃尽了雹灾没有毁掉的菜蔬。So God caused swarms of locusts to come over Egypt. These locusts ate what remained of the crops that the hail had not destroyed.

神又使全埃及地黑暗了三天。埃及人根本无法出门，因为遍地如此黑暗。但是以色列人住的地方，就有亮光。Then God sent darkness that lasted for three days. It was so dark that the Egyptians could not leave their houses. But where the Israelites lived, there was light.

即使经过了九灾，法老仍然不愿让以色列人获得自由，离开埃及。既然法老不愿意再听，于是神便决定降下最后一灾。这将改变法老的心意。Even after these nine plagues, Pharaoh still refused to let the Israelites go free. Since Pharaoh would not listen, there was one last plague that God planned to send. This would change Pharaoh’s mind.
