以色列人在西奈山得到了神的约。之后，神继续引领他们去向应许之地，那地也叫迦南地。云柱指引他们前进的方向。After the Israelites received God’s Covenant at Mount Sinai, God began leading them toward the Promised Land, which was also called Canaan. The cloud pillar showed them the way.

神曾向亚伯拉罕，以撒，雅各应许赐给他们后代一块应许之地，但是现在那地住了许多其他部落的人。他们被称作迦南人。迦南人不信神。他们敬拜假神，且作了很多恶事。God had promised Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob that He would give the Promised Land to their descendants, but now there were many tribes of people living there. They were called Canaanites. The Canaanites did not believe in God. They worshiped false gods and did many evil things.

神告诉以色列人，“你必要除灭这地上的迦南人。不要和他们和好，也不要与他们婚配。你们必要彻底摧毁他们所有的偶像。如果你们不这么做，就会去敬拜别的偶像，而不是敬拜我。”God told the Israelites, “You must get rid of all the Canaanites in the Promised Land. Do not make peace with them and do not marry them. You must completely destroy all of their idols. If you do not do these things, you will worship their idols instead of Me.”

以色列人到达迦南边境后，摩西从十二个支派中各选出一个人。他指示这些人去刺探那地，看那地的情形。他们也去窥探那地的迦南人是强壮还是瘦弱。When the Israelites reached the edge of Canaan, Moses chose twelve men, one from each tribe of Israel. He gave the men instructions to go and spy on the land to see what it was like. They were also to spy on the Canaanites to see if they were strong or weak.

在窥探那地四十天后，这些人回来了。十个探子报告了坏消息，说，“那地是很好的，出产也极丰盛！但那城非常坚固，人也非常巨大！如果攻击他们，我们必死！”The men spied on Canaan for forty days, then they came back. Ten of the spies gave a bad report, saying, “The land is very good, and the crops are great! But the cities are very strong, and the people are giants! If we attack them, we will surely die!”

另两个探子，迦勒和约书亚，立刻说道，“那地的人确实又高又壮，但是我们能击败他们！神会为我们而战！”Immediately Caleb and Joshua, the other two spies, said, “It is true that the people of Canaan are tall and strong, but we can certainly defeat them! God will fight for us!”

以色列人恼怒摩西和亚伦，说，“你们为什么把我们带到这个可怕的地方？我们应该呆在埃及地，而不是在战场上被杀死，使我们的妻子儿女沦为奴隶。”人们想要杀掉他们，并选出新的领导人带领他们回到埃及。But the people were mad at Moses and Aaron and said, “Oh, why did you bring us to this horrible place? We should have stayed in Egypt rather than be killed in battle and our wives and children made slaves.” The people wanted to kill them and choose a new leader to bring them back to Egypt.

神很生气，他在会幕出现。神说，“除了约书亚和迦勒，所有二十岁及以上的人都要在旷野游荡，直到他们死去。他们永远也不会进到应许之地。”God was very angry, and His presence appeared at the Tent of Meeting. God said, “Except for Joshua and Caleb, all of the people who are twenty years old or older will wander in the wilderness until they die. They will never enter the Promised Land.”

当人们听到这些，他们为他们犯的罪悔恨。他们带上武器去进攻迦南地。摩西警告他们不要去，因为神没有与他们同在，但他们不听摩西。When the people heard this, they were sorry they had sinned. They took their weapons and went to attack Canaan. Moses warned them not to go because God was not with them, but they did not listen to him.

这场战役中神没有与他们同在，所以他们被打败了，并且很多人被杀了。剩下的以色列人从迦南地退回并且在旷野游荡了四十年。God did not go with them into this battle, so they were defeated and many of them were killed. Then the rest of the Israelites turned back from Canaan and wandered through the wilderness for forty years.

在旷野游荡的日子里，神供给他们。他给他们从天上来的饼，叫做“吗哪”。他也送来了鹌鹑到他们的帐篷前，使得他们有肉吃。在那四十年里，神保守他们的衣服和鞋子不会被穿坏。During that time of wandering, God provided for them. He gave them bread from heaven, called “manna.” He also sent quail (a kind of bird) into their camp so they could have meat to eat. During those forty years, God kept their clothes and shoes from wearing out.

神甚至奇迹般的从岩石中变出水来。但即使这样，以色列民仍然抱怨神和摩西。神却仍持守他对亚伯拉罕，以撒，雅各的约。God even miraculously gave them water from a rock. But despite all this, the people of Israel complained and grumbled against God and against Moses. God was still faithful to His promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

{{:en:obs:obs-14-13.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

有一次，人们没有水了，神告诉摩西，“对石头说话，水就会出来。”但是摩西违背了神，他当着人们的面用棍子击打了两次岩石，而不是对岩石说话。岩石流出了水让人们喝。但是神对摩西发怒，说，“你必不得进入应许之地。”One time, the people had no water. God told Moses, “Speak to the rock, and water will come out of it.” But Moses dishonored God in front of all the people by hitting the rock twice with a stick instead of speaking to it. Water came out of the rock for everyone to drink, but God was angry with Moses and said, “You will not enter the Promised Land.”

在游荡四十年之后，所有悖逆神的人都死去了。神便带领以色列民又来到应许之地的边境。摩西已经非常老了，他便选了约书亚帮助他领导人民。神应许摩西将兴起另一位像他一样的先知。After they had wandered in the wilderness for forty years, all the people who had rebelled against God were dead. God led the Israelites to the edge of the Promised Land again. Moses was now very old, so he chose Joshua to help him lead the people. God promised Moses that one day He would raise up another prophet like Moses.

神把摩西带到了山顶，他便能看到应许之地。摩西看到了，但却进不去。不久，摩西死了，以色列人哀哭三十天。约书亚成为了他们新的领导人。约书亚是一个好的首领，因为他全心信靠神。God brought Moses to the top of a mountain so he could see the Promised Land. Moses saw the Promised Land but never entered it. Then Moses died, and the Israelites mourned for thirty days. Joshua became their new leader. Joshua was a good leader because he trusted and obeyed God.
