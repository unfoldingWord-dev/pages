====== 3. The Flood ======

{{:en:obs:obs-03-01.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

Many years later, many people were living in the world. They had become very wicked and violent. It became so bad that God decided to destroy the whole world with a huge flood.

Kalpasan nga pinapanaw ti Dios ti lalaki ken ti babai idiay kakaykaywan, ket naadaanda iti annak, ket immadu nga immadu ti tattao ditoy lubong. Nakita ti Dios nga nalablabesen ti kinadakes dagiti tattao. 
Ket nagbabawi isuna nga nangiparsua kadakuada.

But Noah found grace in God’s eyes. He was the only righteous man among all the wicked people. God told Noah about the flood He was planning to send. He told Noah to build a huge boat called an ark.

Adda laeng ti maysa kadakuada nga nasayaat iti immatang ti Dios, isu ni Noah. Nasingpet ken naturnog ni Noah iti Dios. Kunana kenni Noah, "Pukawek ida nga maminpinsan. Layusek tu ti daga ket matay tu amin nga addaan ti biagna ditoy. 
Kinunana pay kenni Noah, "Isalakankanto ken dagiti pamilyam. Mangaramidka iti dakkel nga bangka ket aglugankayto idiay."

God told Noah to make the boat about 140 meters long, 23 meters wide, and 13.5 meters high. It was to be made of wood and have three levels, many rooms, a roof, and a window. The boat would keep Noah, his family, and two of every kind of animal safe during the flood.

"Mangalaka iti maysa nga pangasawaan iti amin nga klase dagiti ananimal ken tumatayab."

Noah obeyed God. He and his three sons built the boat just the way God had told them. It took many years to build the boat, because it was so big. Noah warned the people about the coming flood and told them to turn to God, but they just laughed at him.

Inaramid ngarud ni Noah ti nakadakdakel nga bangka.

Noah and his family also gathered enough food for themselves and the animals. When everything was ready, God told Noah it was time for him, his wife, his three sons, and their wives to get into the boat—eight people in all.

Ket idi nalpasen, naglugan ngarud ni Noah ken dagiti pamilyana, agraman dagiti ananimal ken tumatayab nga kas imbilin ti Dios.

God sent a male and a female of every animal and bird to Noah so they could go into the boat and be kept safe during the flood. God sent seven males and seven females of every type of animal which could be used for sacrifices. When they were all in the boat, God Himself closed the door.

Then it began to rain, and rain, and rain. It rained for forty days and forty nights without stopping! Water also came gushing up out of the earth. Everything in the whole world was covered with water, even the highest mountains.

Idi kuan nagtudo iti nakapigpigsa unay nagpaot daytoy iti uppat nga pulo nga aldaw. 
Naglayos iti nakapigpigsa ken nakadakdakel.

Everything that lived on the dry land died, except the people and animals who were in the boat. The boat floated on the water and everything inside the boat was kept safe.

Nalapunos pay ultimo kangangatoan nga banbantay. Ket natay amin nga addaan ti biagna nga agnaed iti daga. 

{{:en:obs:obs-03-09.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

After the rains stopped, the boat floated on the water for five months, and then one day the boat rested on the top of a mountain. But the world was still covered with water. After three more months, the tops of the mountains were visible.

Nagbayag ti layos ket nabayag met nga panawen sa imbaas ti danum. 


{{:en:obs:obs-03-10.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

After forty more days, Noah sent out a bird called a raven to see if the water had dried up. The raven flew back and forth looking for dry land, but it could not find any.

{{:en:obs:obs-03-11.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

Later Noah sent out a bird called a dove. But it also could not find any dry land, so it came back to Noah. A week later he sent the dove out again, and it came back with an olive branch in its beak! The water was going down, and the plants were growing again!

{{:en:obs:obs-03-12.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

Noah waited another week and sent out the dove a third time. This time, it did not come back. The water had dried up!

{{:en:obs:obs-03-13.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

Two months later God said to Noah, “You and your family and all the animals may leave the boat now. Have many children and grandchildren and fill the earth.” So they obeyed and left the boat.

Ket idi nagmagan ti daga, rimmuaren ni Noah ken dagiti kakaduana manipud idiay bangka. 


{{:en:obs:obs-03-14.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

After he got off the boat, Noah built an altar and sacrificed some of each kind of animal which could be used for a sacrifice. God was happy with the sacrifice and blessed Noah and his family.

{{:en:obs:obs-03-15.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

God said, “I will never again curse the ground because of humans or destroy the world with a flood, even though humans are sinful from their youth.”

Kinuna ti Dios kenni Noah, "Ikarik Noah, saankonton nga patayen manen nga mamaminsan. Dagiti addaan iti biag ditoy daga babaen iti layus."

God then made the first rainbow as a sign of His promise. Every time the rainbow appeared in the sky, God would remember what He promised and so would His people.

"Mangikabilak iti bulalayaw idiay langit. Ket kada agparang daytoy ket maipalagip daytoy nainak inkari."
