Saul was the first king of Israel. He was tall and handsome, just like the people wanted. Saul did well at first, but he became a wicked man who did not obey God, so God chose a different man to be king in his place.

Ni Saul ti immuna nga ari ti Israel. Numampay natayag ken nataer kas pinili dagiti tao, ngem nadangkes a tao ken dina kayat ti agtulnog iti Dios. Isu't gapuna a nangpili ti Dios iti kasukatna nga ari.

This man’s name was David. He was a shepherd. While watching the sheep, David had killed both a lion and a bear which had attacked the sheep. David was also a humble and righteous man who trusted and obeyed God.

Ti nagan daytoy a tao ket David. Maysa a pastor iti ayop. Napakumbaba ken natulnog a tao, nalinteg ken agtalek iti Dios.

David was also a great soldier and leader. When David was still a young man, he fought against a giant named Goliath. Goliath was a trained soldier, very strong, and almost three meters tall! But God helped David kill Goliath and save Israel.

Saul became jealous of David and tried many times to kill him. One day Saul was looking for David so he could kill him. Saul went into the same cave where David was hiding. Instead of killing Saul, David cut off a piece of his clothes to prove to Saul that he would not kill him to become king.

Napalalo ti imon ni Saul ken ni David ket sumagmamano a  daras a pinadasna a patayen. Ngem saan a binales ni David tapno isu koman ti agtugaw nga ari. Maysa nga aldaw, simrek ni Saul iti rukib a paglemlemmengan ni David.  Gundaway koman ni David a patayen, ngem nangpigis laeng iti gayadan ti kagay ni Saul tapno paneknekanna nga awan ti gandatna a mangpatay kenkuana. Saan a nagbayag natay met laeng ni Saul iti pannakigaubatna kadagiti Palistino ket nagtugaw ni David a kasukatna nga ari.

Eventually, Saul died in battle, and David became king of Israel. He was a good king, and the people loved him. God blessed David and made him successful. David fought many battles and God gave him victory. David conquered Jerusalem and made it his capital. During David’s reign, Israel became powerful and wealthy.

David wanted to build a temple where everybody could worship God and offer Him sacrifices. For about 400 years, the people had been worshiping God and offering sacrifices to Him at the Tent of Meeting that Moses had built.

Kalpasanna, kayat met ni David ti mangibangon iti patakder a Pagdayawan ken pagidatonanda amin. Ngamin iti las-ud iti agarup sangaribu a tawen, ti Tabernakulo nga inaramid ni Moses ti pagdaydayawan dagiti tao.

God sent the prophet Nathan to David with this message, “Because you are a man of war, you will not build Me this house; your son will. But, I will bless you greatly. Someone from your family will always sit on the throne of Israel. And the Messiah will be one of your descendants!” The Messiah is God’s Chosen One who would save the world from sin.

Rinugian ngarud ni David ti nagaramid iti plano ti patakder, ngem imbaon ti Dios ni propeta Natan ken ni David ket kinunana, “Saan a sika ti mangibangon daytoy a patakder, maysanto kadagiti annakmo. Nupay no kasta, ibukbukko kenka ti adu a bindesyon, kanayon a maysanto kadagiti kaputotam  agari iti Israel. Saan laeng a dayta, ti Mesias agtaudto iti maysa kadakuada.

When David heard these words, he immediately thanked and praised God because He had promised David great honor and many blessings. The Israelites would have to wait a long time before the Messiah came, almost 1,000 years.

Idi nangeg daytoy ni David, nagyaman ken nagdaydayaw iti Dios gapu iti kinaimbagna kenkuana.

David ruled with justice and faithfulness for many years, and God blessed him. However, toward the end of his life he sinned terribly before God.

Ni David ti ari iti Israel. Nabileg  ken nagturay a nalinteg iti adu a tawtawen. Ngem urayno kasta, iti maudi a paset ti  panagbiagna, nadagsen a basol ti naaramidna iti sangoanan ti Dios.

One day, when all of his soldiers were out fighting, David got up from an afternoon nap and saw a beautiful woman bathing. Her name was Bathsheba.

Maysa a malem, kabayatanna nga adda iti paggugubatan dagiti soldadona, bimmangon sa napan nagpagnapagna iti rabaw ti balayna. Kabayatanna nga agpagpagna, natan-awanna ti maysa a napintas a babai nga agdigdigos.


{{:en:obs:obs-17-11.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Instead of looking away, David sent someone to bring her to him. He slept with her and sent her back home. A short time later Bathsheba sent a message to David saying that she was pregnant.

Ket embes a tallikudanna, nangibaun ketdi iti napan nangala kenkuana ket kinaiddana, kalpasanna pinagawidna. Iti saan a nagbayag, impakaammo ti babai  ken ni David a nagsikog isuna.


{{:en:obs:obs-17-12.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Her husband, Uriah, was one of David’s best soldiers. David called Uriah back from the battle and told him to go be with his wife. But Uriah refused to go home while the rest of the soldiers were in battle. So David sent Uriah back to the battle and had him placed where the enemy was strongest so that he would be killed.

Maysa kadagiti kalaingan a soldado ni David ni Urias  - ti lakay ti babai a nasikoganna. Pinaayaban ni David ti lakayna manipud paggugubatan ket kinuna “agawidka”. Ngem saan a maaramid dayta ni Urias ta adda pay iti paggugubatan dagiti padana a soldado. Isu't gapuna a nagsurat ni David iti komander ni Urias. Imbilinna nga ikabelna ni Urias iti sango ti paglalabanan tapno matay. Nagtungpal ngarud ti komanderna ket natay ni Urias.

After Uriah was killed, David married Bathsheba. Later, she gave birth to a son. God was not pleased with what David had done, so He sent the prophet Nathan to show David his sin. David repented of his sin and God forgave him. For the rest of his life, David trusted God, even in difficult times.

Inasawa ni David ti nabalo ni Urias. Saan a nagustoan ti Dios ti inaramid ni David, ket imbaon na ni propeta Natan a mangtubngar kenkuana.

But as punishment for his sin, David’s baby boy died. There was also fighting in David’s family for the rest of his life, and David’s power was greatly weakened. Though David had been unfaithful to God, God was still faithful to His promises. Bathsheba gave birth to another son named Solomon.

Idi nabigbig ni David ti basolna, nagbabawi ket pinakawan met ti Dios. Ngem kas supapak ti basolna, awan urnos iti pamilyana iti entero a biagna ket gapu iti daytoy, napukaw ti bileg ti turayna.
