====== demon ======


===== Definition: =====

Demons are spirit beings that oppose God's will.

    * God created spirit beings to serve him. Some rebelled against him and are called "demons." Those who continue to serve him are called "angels."
    * Demons and angels are more powerful than humans, but not as powerful as God.
    * Sometimes demons attack people or try to control them. We call this, "demon-possession."
    * Demons sometimes use their power to make idols or false gods appear to be real.
    * Jesus gave his apostles power over the demons.
    * When Jesus returns to earth, he will punish everyone who has rebelled against him, including the demons, Satan, and unbelievers.
    * "Demon" can also be translated as, "evil spirit."

The opposite of “demon” is an “angel.”
