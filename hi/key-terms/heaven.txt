====== heaven ======


==== (heaven, sky, heavenly) ====

===== Definition: =====

The word "heaven" can refer to two different things in the Bible:

    * Sometimes "heaven" refers to the place where God lives.
    * Other times it refers to the sky: the space above the earth, including the air we breathe and everything we see above the earth, such as the blue expanse and the clouds, sun, moon, and stars.
    * In some contexts "heaven" could refer to both the sky and the place where God lives.
