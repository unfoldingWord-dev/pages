====== power ======


===== Definition: =====


The word "power" can refer to the ability to do things or make things happen, physical strength, or authority to rule.

    * The "power of God" refers to God's ability to do things that are not possible for people to do.
    * God is the source of all power--his power is never limited.
    * God is the highest authority, and has complete power over everything that he has created.
    * God gives his people power to do what he wants, so that when they heal people or do other miracles, they do this by the power of God.
    * Because Jesus and the Holy Spirit are also God, they have and use this same power.
