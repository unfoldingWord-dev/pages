===== Definitions: =====

To "fulfill" something is to complete or accomplish what was predicted, required, or expected.

    * When a prophecy is fulfilled, what the prophecy said would happen actually happens.
    * Every prophecy that is truly from God will be fulfilled.
    * Some prophecies have already been partially fulfilled, but will be completely fulfilled at a later time.
    * Many of the prophecies about the Messiah were fulfilled hundreds of years after they were spoken by the prophets. Some of the events that were prophesied have not yet happened, but they will be fulfilled when Jesus returns.
