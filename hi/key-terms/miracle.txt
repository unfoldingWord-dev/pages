====== miracle ======


==== (miracle, wonder, sign) ====


===== Definition: =====

Miracles are things that could never happen unless God caused them. For example, it was a miracle when God brought a dead person back to life.

  * Miracles are sometimes called “wonders” because people are amazed by them. They are also called “signs” because they show that God is working through them.
  * Since miracles are done by the power of God, they are sometimes called, "works of power."
  * People do not have the power to do miracles on their own. However, God has given different people the power to do miracles on many occasions to accomplish his purposes. 
  * For example, the prophets asked God to heal people, to provide food from nothing, and even to raise people from the dead, and God did those things.
