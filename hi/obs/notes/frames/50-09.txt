====== The Enemy Is the Devil [50-09] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-50-09.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

“The weeds represent the people **who belong to the [[:en:key-terms:evil|evil]] one**. The enemy who planted the weeds represents **the [[:en:key-terms:satan|devil]]**. The harvest **represents the end of the world**, and **the harvesters** represent **[[:en:key-terms:god|God's]]** **[[:en:key-terms:angel|angels]]**.”


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **who belong to the evil one** - That is, “who obey the evil one” or, “who are ruled by the evil one.”
  * **the evil one** - This is another title for Satan. It could be translated as, "Satan," but the title, "evil one" describes his character.
  * **the devil** - This could also be translated as, "Satan."
  * **represents the end of the world** - That is, "represents what will happen to people at the end of the world."
  * **the harvesters** – This could also be translated as, “the men who harvest the ripe grain” or, “the workers who gather in the ripe grain.”
