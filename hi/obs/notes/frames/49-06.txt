====== Not All Will Be Saved [49-06] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-33-02.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

**[[:en:key-terms:jesus|Jesus]]** taught that some people will **[[:en:key-terms:receive|receive]]** him and be **[[:en:key-terms:save|saved]]**, but **others will not**. He said that some people are like good soil. They receive the **[[:en:key-terms:good-news|good news]]** of Jesus and are saved. Other people are like the hard soil of a path, where the **seed of [[:en:key-terms:word-of-god|God's word]]** does not enter and does not produce any harvest. Those people reject the message about Jesus and will not enter into **[[:en:key-terms:kingdom-of-god|his kingdom]]**. 

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **others will not** - That is, "other people will not receive him and therefore will not be saved."
  * **seed of God's word** - This can be translated as, "seed, which can be compared to God's word." This phrase makes a comparison between seed and God's word.
