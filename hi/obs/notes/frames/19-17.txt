====== Jeremiah Suffered for God [19-17] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-19-17.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

Most of the time, the people did not **[[:en:key-terms:obey|obey]]** **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]**. They often mistreated the **[[:en:key-terms:prophet|prophets]]** and sometimes even killed them. Once, the prophet **[[:en:key-terms:jeremiah|Jeremiah]]** was put into a **dry well** and left there to die. He sank down into the mud that was in the bottom of the well, but then the **[[:en:key-terms:king|king]] had [[:en:key-terms:mercy|mercy]] on him** and ordered his servants to pull Jeremiah out of the well before he died.


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **dry well** - The well did not currently have any water in it, but it did still have mud in the bottom. This could be translated as, “empty well.”
  * **had mercy on him** – This means he was kind to Jeremiah and helped him.
