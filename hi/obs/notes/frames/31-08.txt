**When [[:en:key-terms:peter|Peter]] and [[:en:key-terms:jesus|Jesus]] got into the boat, the wind** immediately stopped blowing and the water became calm. The **[[:en:key-terms:disciple|disciples]]** were amazed. They **[[:en:key-terms:worship|worshiped]]** Jesus, saying to him, “**[[:en:key-terms:true|Truly]], you are the [[:en:key-terms:god-son|Son of God]]**.”

//A Bible story from: Matthew 14:22-33; Mark 6:45-52; John 6:16-21//


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **When Peter and Jesus got into the boat, the wind** – It may be better to say, “Peter and Jesus got into the boat, and then the wind.”
  * **worshiped Jesus** – This could be translated as, “bowed down and worshiped Jesus.” This word has the idea of physically bowing down in front of someone out of respect and reverence.
  * **Truly you are the Son of God** – Other ways to say this would be, “You really are the Son of God” or, “It really is true that you are the Son of God.”
  * //A Bible story from// - These references may be slightly different in some Bible translations.
