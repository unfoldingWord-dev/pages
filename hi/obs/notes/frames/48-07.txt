**[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** told **[[:en:key-terms:abraham|Abraham]]**, “**All the [[:en:key-terms:people-group|people groups]] of the earth** will be **[[:en:key-terms:bless|blessed]]** through you.” **[[:en:key-terms:jesus|Jesus]]** was a **[[:en:key-terms:descendant|descendant]] **of Abraham. All the people groups are blessed through him, because everyone who **[[:en:key-terms:believe|believes]]** in Jesus is **[[:en:key-terms:save|saved]]** from sin, and becomes **a [[:en:key-terms:spirit|spiritual]] descendant of Abraham**.

  * **all the people groups of the earth** – This could also be translated as, “people from all different parts of the world.”
  * **a spiritual descendant of Abraham** - That is, "spiritually related to Abraham, and one of God's people."
