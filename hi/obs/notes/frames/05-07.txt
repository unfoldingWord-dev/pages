As **[[:en:key-terms:abraham|Abraham]]** and **[[:en:key-terms:isaac|Isaac]]** **walked to the place of [[:en:key-terms:sacrifice|sacrifice]]**, Isaac asked, “Father, we have **wood for the sacrifice**, but where is **the [[:en:key-terms:lamb|lamb]]**?” Abraham replied, “**[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** will provide the lamb for the sacrifice, my son.”

===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **walked to the place of sacrifice** - God had told Abraham to sacrifice Isaac on a special high hill that was about three days' walk from where they lived. 
  * **wood for the sacrifice** - For a sacrifice, normally the lamb was killed and then placed on top of wood so that the wood and the lamb could be burned up with fire.
  * **the lamb** - A young sheep or goat would be the normal animal for a sacrifice. 
  * **provide** - Abraham may have believed that Isaac was the "lamb" that God provided, although God fulfilled Abraham's words by providing a ram to sacrifice in Isaac's place.
