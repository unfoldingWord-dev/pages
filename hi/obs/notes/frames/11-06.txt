====== Death of the Firstborn [11-06] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-11-06.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

But the **[[:en:key-terms:egypt|Egyptians]]** **did not [[:en:key-terms:believe|believe]] [[:en:key-terms:god|God]] or obey his commands**. So God **did not pass over** their houses. God killed every one of the Egyptians' firstborn sons.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **did not believe God or obey his commands** – In some languages it may be more natural or clear to say, “did not believe God and so they did not obey his commands.”
  * **did not pass over** - He did not pass by their houses. Rather he stopped at each house and killed their eldest son.
