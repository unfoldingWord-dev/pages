Then **[[:en:key-terms:elijah|Elijah]]** said, “Do not let any of the **[[:en:key-terms:prophet|prophets]]** of **[[:en:key-terms:baal|Baal]] escape**!” So the people **captured** the prophets of Baal. Then Elijah took them away from there and killed them.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **escape** - The prophets of Baal tried to run away after their god was proven to be a false god.
  * **captured** – That is, “seized and held onto” or, “took hold of.”
