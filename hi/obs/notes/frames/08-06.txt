After two years, **[[:en:key-terms:joseph|Joseph]]** was still in prison, even though he was **[[:en:key-terms:innocent|innocent]]**. One night, the **[[:en:key-terms:pharaoh|Pharaoh]]**, which is what the **[[:en:key-terms:egypt|Egyptians]]** called their **[[:en:key-terms:king|kings]]**, had two **[[:en:key-terms:dream|dreams]]** that **disturbed him greatly**. None of **his advisors** could tell him the **meaning of the dreams**.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **disturbed him greatly** – This means that the king felt very afraid and confused (because of what he had seen in the dreams). 
  * **his advisors** - These were men with special powers and knowledge who could sometimes tell what dreams meant. Some translations refer to them as, “wise men.” 
  * **meaning of the dreams** - People in Egypt believed that dreams were messages from the gods telling them about what would happen in the future. God used Pharaoh's dreams to tell him what would happen.
