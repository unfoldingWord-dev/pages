{{:en:obs:obs-50-04.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

**[[:en:key-terms:jesus|Jesus]]** also said, “A **[[:en:key-terms:servant|servant]]** is **not greater than** his **[[:en:key-terms:lord|master]]**. Just as the authorities of this world have hated me, they will torture and kill you **because of me**. Although **in this world** you will **[[:en:key-terms:suffer|suffer]]**, be encouraged because I have defeated **[[:en:key-terms:satan|Satan]]**, the one who rules this world. If you **remain [[:en:key-terms:faithful|faithful]] to me** **to the end**, then **God will [[:en:key-terms:save|save]] you**!”


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **not greater than** - That is, "not more important than" or, in this case, "not treated better than."
  * **because of me** - That is, “because you obey me” or, “because you teach people about me” or, "because you belong to me."
  * **in this world** - This could also be translated as, "in this lifetime."
  * **remain faithful to me** - That is, “Keep obeying me.”
  * **to the end** - That is, "to the end of your life."
  * **will save you** - This refers to spiritual salvation rather than physical deliverance from harm. It has already been stated that many believers will be killed or tortured.
