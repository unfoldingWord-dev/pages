So Ananias went to **[[:en:key-terms:paul|Saul]]**, placed his hands on him, and said, “**[[:en:key-terms:jesus|Jesus]]**, who appeared to you on your way **here**, sent me to you so that you can **regain your sight** and be filled with the **[[:en:key-terms:holy-spirit|Holy Spirit]]**.” Saul immediately was able to see again, and Ananias **[[:en:key-terms:baptize|baptized]]** him. Then Saul ate some food and **his strength returned**.
