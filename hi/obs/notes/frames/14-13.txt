Another time when the people did not have any water, **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** told **[[:en:key-terms:moses|Moses]]**, “Speak to the rock, and water will come out of it.” But **Moses dishonored God** in front of all the people **by hitting the rock twice with a stick instead of speaking to it**. Water came out of the rock for everyone to drink, but God was angry with Moses and said, “You will not enter the **[[:en:key-terms:promised-land|Promised Land]]**.”


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **Moses dishonored God** - This could be translated, "Moses disobeyed God" or, "Moses disrespected God." God had a specific way He wanted Moses to show the people God's power to provide for them. When Moses disobeyed God by doing it in a different way he showed a lack of respect for God. 
  * **by hitting the rock twice with a stick instead of speaking to it** - This can be translated as, “Moses did not speak to the rock; he hit it twice with a stick.”
