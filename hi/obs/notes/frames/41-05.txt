When the women arrived at the tomb, the **[[:en:key-terms:angel|angel]]** told them, “**Do not be afraid**. **[[:en:key-terms:jesus|Jesus]]** is not here. **He has [[:en:key-terms:raise|risen]] from the [[:en:key-terms:death|dead]]**, just like he said he would! Look in the **[[:en:key-terms:tomb|tomb]]** and see.” The women looked into the tomb and saw where Jesus' body had been laid. His body was not there!


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Do not be afraid** - That is, “Stop being afraid.” An angel shining like lightning was a frightening sight! 
  * **He has risen from the dead** – This could be translated as, “He has come back to life.”
