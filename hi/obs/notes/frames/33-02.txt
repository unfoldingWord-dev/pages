{{:en:obs:obs-33-02.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

**[[:en:key-terms:jesus|Jesus]]** told this story. “A farmer went out to plant **some seed**. As he was **spreading the seeds by hand**, some seeds happened to fall on the path, and the birds came and ate all of those seeds.”


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **spreading the seeds by hand** - That is, “throwing the seeds on the soil" or, “covering all of his crop soil with seeds." This is the way that farmers in the ancient Middle East typically planted grain-bearing crops.
