===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **When Joshua was an old man** – It may be clearer to say, “Many years later, when Joshua was an old man.” Joshua was over 100 years old at this time.
  * **remain faithful to God** - In other words, they would be loyal to God. They would worship and serve only God; they would not worship or serve any other gods. 
  * **follow his laws** - This means that the people would obey the laws that God had given them already as part of the covenant.
  * //A Bible story from// - These references may be slightly different in some Bible translations.
