{{:en:obs:obs-09-14.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

**[[:en:key-terms:moses|Moses]]** asked, “What if **the people** want to know who sent me, what should I say?” **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** said, “**I AM WHO I AM**. Tell them, ‘**I AM** has sent me to you.’ Also tell them, 'I am **[[:en:key-terms:yahweh|Yahweh]]**, the God of your ancestors **[[:en:key-terms:abraham|Abraham]]**, **[[:en:key-terms:isaac|Isaac]]**, and **[[:en:key-terms:jacob|Jacob]]**.' This is **my name** forever.”


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **the people** - See "my people" in **[[:hi:obs:notes:frames:09-13|[09-13]]]**.
  * **I AM WHO I AM** - This description shows that God can only be defined by himself, not by anything else that we know of, and he cannot be compared to anyone else. 
  * **I AM** - This name emphasizes that God is the only one who has always lived and always will live. 
  * **my name** - The name that God told Moses and all of Israel to use for him is “Yahweh,” which is related to “I AM” and appears to mean, “HE IS.”
