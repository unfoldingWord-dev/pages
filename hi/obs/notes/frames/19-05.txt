When Ahab saw Elijah he said, “There you are, **you troublemaker**!” Elijah replied to him, “You are the troublemaker! **You have abandoned [[:en:key-terms:yahweh|Yahweh]]**, the true God, and **[[:en:key-terms:worship|worshiped]]** **[[:en:key-terms:baal|Baal]]**. Bring all the people of the kingdom of Israel to **Mount Carmel**.”
