{{:en:obs:obs-39-04.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

**[[:en:key-terms:jesus|Jesus]]** said, “**I am**, and you will see me **seated with [[:en:key-terms:god|God]] and coming from [[:en:key-terms:heaven|heaven]]**.” The **[[:en:key-terms:priest-high|high priest]]** **tore his clothes in anger** and shouted to the other **[[:en:key-terms:jewish-leaders|religious leaders]]**, “We do not need any more **[[:en:key-terms:witness|witnesses]]**! You have heard him say that he is the **[[:en:key-terms:god-son|Son of God]]**. **What is your [[:en:key-terms:judge|judgment]]**?”


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **I am** - That is, “I am as you said” or, “I am the Messiah and the Son of God.” “I am” is also the name of God (See **[[:hi:obs:notes:frames:09-14|[09-14]]]**). By saying simply, “I am” Jesus was also saying that he is God. If possible, translate this so that people will see a similarity between Jesus' answer and the name of God. 
  * **seated with God** - This could be translated as, “reigning with God.” Because God is the ruler over all, people talk about him as sitting on a throne in heaven. By saying that he would be seated with God, Jesus claimed that he had authority to rule with the Father.
  * **seated with God and coming from heaven** – This could be translated as, “sitting beside God and then coming from heaven.” 
  * **tore his clothes in anger** - The Jews would tear their clothes to show grief or anger. If tearing the clothes means something else in your language, you may want to substitute a phrase such as, “he was extremely angry.” 
  * **What is your judgment?** - That is, “What is your decision?” or, “Tell us what have you decided: Is he innocent or guilty?” The chief priest wanted the religious leaders to condemn Jesus for claiming to be equal with God.
