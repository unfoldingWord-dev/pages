====== The False Witnesses [39-02] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-39-02.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

Inside the house, the **[[:en:key-terms:jewish-leaders|Jewish leaders]]** **put [[:en:key-terms:jesus|Jesus]] on trial**. They brought many false **[[:en:key-terms:witness|witnesses]]** who **lied about him**. However, **their statements did not agree with each other**, so the Jewish leaders could not prove **he was [[:en:key-terms:guilt|guilty]] of anything**. Jesus did not say anything.


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **put Jesus on trial** – This could be translated as, “had a formal meeting to accuse Jesus of doing something wrong.” Usually a trial is done to find out if someone is innocent or guilty of a certain crime. In this case, the leaders were determined to make Jesus seem guilty. 
  * **lied about him** - That is, “told lies about him” or, “falsely accused him of doing something wrong.” 
  * **their statements did not agree with each other** - This could be translated as, “they said things about Jesus that were very different from each other” or, “the witnesses said things about Jesus that contradicted each other.” 
  * **he was guilty of anything** – That is, “that he had done anything wrong.”
