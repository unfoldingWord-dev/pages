**From the very beginning**, **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** planned to send the **[[:en:key-terms:messiah|Messiah]]**. The first **[[:en:key-terms:promise|promise]]** of the Messiah came to **[[:en:key-terms:adam|Adam]]** and **[[:en:key-terms:eve|Eve]]**. God promised that a **[[:en:key-terms:descendant|descendant]]** of Eve would be born who would **crush the snake’s head**. **The snake who deceived Eve was [[:en:key-terms:satan|Satan]]**. The promise meant that the Messiah would defeat Satan completely.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **From the very beginning** - That is, from when the earth was first created.
  * **crush the snake’s head** - Unless the head of a venomous snake is crushed, the snake can still hurt someone. Use a word for “crush” that communicates that its head is destroyed.  
  * **The snake…was Satan** – Satan spoke to Eve in the form of a snake. This does not mean that he is a snake now. This could be translated as, “The snake…was an appearance of Satan.”
  * **who deceived Eve** - That is, “who lied to Eve." The snake lied by making Eve doubt what God had said and tricking her into disobeying God.
