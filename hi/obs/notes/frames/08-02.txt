====== Joseph Was Sold as a Slave [08-02] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-08-01.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**[[:en:key-terms:joseph|Joseph’s]]** brothers hated him because their father loved him most and because Joseph had **[[:en:key-terms:dream|dreamed]]** that he would be their ruler. When Joseph **came to his brothers**, they **kidnapped** him and sold him to some **[[:en:key-terms:servant|slave]] traders**.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **came to his brothers** – Another way this could be translated is, “reached the place where his brothers were.” 
  * **kidnapped** - They took him against his will. It was not right for them to do this.
  * **slave traders** - These were people who made a business of buying people from one owner and selling them as slaves to another owner.
