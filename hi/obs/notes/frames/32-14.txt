{{:en:obs:obs-32-14.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

She had heard that **[[:en:key-terms:jesus|Jesus]]** had **[[:en:key-terms:heal|healed]]** many sick people and thought, “**I'm sure that if I can just touch Jesus’ clothes, then I will be healed, too!**” So she came up behind Jesus and touched his clothes. As soon as she touched them, the bleeding stopped!
