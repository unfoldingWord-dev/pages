Then **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** allowed **[[:en:key-terms:zechariah-nt|Zechariah]]** to speak again. Zechariah said, “**[[:en:key-terms:praise|Praise]] God**, because he has remembered his people!

  * **Praise God** - That is, "We should all praise God."
  * **will be called** - This is another way of saying, “will be” or, “will be known as.” John would actually be the Prophet of the Most High God.
  * **the prophet** - That is, “the very important prophet." John would be the prophet that the Old Testament prophets had predicted would come before the Messiah.
  * **Most High God** - Another way to say this would be, “the God who is greater than everything” or, “the God who rules over everything.”
