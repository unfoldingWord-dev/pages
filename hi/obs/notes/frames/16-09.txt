====== The Wet Cloth [16-09] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-16-09.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


For the first **sign**, **[[:en:key-terms:gideon|Gideon]]** laid a cloth on the ground and asked **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** to **let the morning dew fall** only on the cloth and not on the ground. **God did that**. The next night, he asked that the ground be wet but the cloth dry. God did that too. These two signs convinced Gideon that God would use him to **[[:en:key-terms:save|save]]** **[[:en:key-terms:israel|Israel]]** from the **[[:en:key-terms:midian|Midianites]]**.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **sign** - This could be translated as, “miracle" or, "impossible thing."
  * **let the morning dew fall** - This can be translated as, “make the morning dew appear” or, “make the morning dew come up.” "Dew" refers to the drops of water that appear on the ground in the morning. Dew naturally covers everything equally. 
  * **God did that** - This could be translated as, “God did what Gideon asked him to do.”
