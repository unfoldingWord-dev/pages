{{:en:obs:obs-23-09.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

**Sometime later**, **[[:en:key-terms:wise|wise]] men** from countries far to the east saw an **unusual star** in the sky. **They realized** it meant a new **[[:en:key-terms:king-of-jews|king of the Jews]]** had been born. So, they traveled a great distance to see this king. They came to **[[:en:key-terms:bethlehem|Bethlehem]]** and found **the house** where **[[:en:key-terms:jesus|Jesus]]** and his parents were staying.


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Sometime later** - It is not clear how long it was after the birth of Jesus before the wise men saw the star, but it may have taken as long as two years for them to prepare for the trip and then travel to Bethlehem.
  * **wise men** - The “wise men” were probably astrologers who studied the stars. They may also have had access to the Old Testament prophets' writings that predicted the birth of the Messiah.
  * **unusual star** - The star that they noticed was not a normal star. It was something that appeared at the time of Jesus' birth.
  * **They realized** - Some languages may add, “From their studies, these scholars realized.” 
  * **the house** - They were no longer staying in the place for animals where he was born.
