===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **One day** - This phrase introduces an event that happened in the past, but does not state the specific time. Many languages have a similar way to begin telling a true story.
  * **saw** - Bathsheba may have been bathing at her own house, but David's palace was very high and he was able to see over walls that were lower.
  * ** bathing** - This may be translated as, "taking a bath" or, "washing herself."
