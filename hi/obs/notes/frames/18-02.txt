People now **[[:en:key-terms:worship|worshiped]]** **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** and offered **[[:en:key-terms:sacrifice|sacrifices]]** to him at the Temple instead of at the **[[:en:key-terms:tent-of-meeting|Tent of Meeting]]**.

===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **was present in the Temple** – That is, “was present in the Temple in a special way.” Even though God was also present everywhere else at the same time, he made himself especially available to the people at the Temple.
  * **with his people** - This could be translated as, "in the midst of his people" or, "among his people."
