====== Esau Sold His Rights [07-02] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-07-02.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

One day, when **[[:en:key-terms:esau|Esau]]** came back from hunting, he was very hungry. Esau said to **[[:en:key-terms:jacob|Jacob]]**, “Please **give me some of the food** you have made.” Jacob responded, “First, **give me your rights as the oldest son**.” So Esau gave Jacob his **rights as the oldest son**. Then Jacob gave him some food.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **give me some of the food … give me your rights** – Some languages may prefer to use two different words for “give” here. This would also apply to, “Esau gave … Jacob gave” in the last two sentences.
  * **rights as the oldest son** - According to their custom, since Esau was the oldest son, he should have been the one to receive twice as much of their father's wealth when their father died. Jacob thought of a way to take these rights of the oldest son from Esau.
