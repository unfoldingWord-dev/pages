But the people did not listen to **[[:en:key-terms:caleb|Caleb]]** and **[[:en:key-terms:joshua|Joshua]]**. They became angry with **[[:en:key-terms:moses|Moses]]** and **[[:en:key-terms:aaron|Aaron]]** and said, “**Why did you bring us** to **this horrible place**? We should have stayed in **[[:en:key-terms:egypt|Egypt]] rather than be killed in battle and our wives and children made [[:en:key-terms:servant|slaves]]**.” The people wanted to choose a different leader to take them back to Egypt.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **Why did you bring us** – This is not a real question. It is a way that some languages use to say, “You should not have brought us.” 
  * **this horrible place** - They considered Canaan to be “horrible” because they thought it was so dangerous that they would all be killed. 
  * **rather than be killed in battle and our wives and children made slaves** - This could be translated as, “If we fight against the Canaanites, they will kill us men and force our wives and children to be their slaves.”
