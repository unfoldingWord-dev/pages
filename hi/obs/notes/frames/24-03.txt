When people heard **[[:en:key-terms:john-baptist|John's]]** message, many of them **[[:en:key-terms:repent|repented]] from their [[:en:key-terms:sin|sins]]**, and John **[[:en:key-terms:baptize|baptized]]** them. Many **[[:en:key-terms:jewish-leaders|religious leaders]]** also came to be baptized by John, but they **did not repent** or **confess their sins**.


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **repented from their sins** - This could also be translated as, "repented concerning their sins" or, "changed their minds about their sins" or, "turned away from their sins."
  * **did not repent** - That is, "did not turn away from their sins."
  * **confess their sins** - To confess is to acknowledge that something is true. These leaders did not want to acknowledge that they had sinned. This may be translated as, "confess that they had sinned."
