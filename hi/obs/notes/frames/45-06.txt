====== The People Attacked the Believers [45-06] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-45-06.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


A young man named **[[:en:key-terms:paul|Saul]]** agreed with the people who killed Stephen and **guarded their robes** while they threw stones at him. That day, many people in **[[:en:key-terms:jerusalem|Jerusalem]]** started **[[:en:key-terms:persecute|persecuting]]** the followers of **[[:en:key-terms:jesus|Jesus]]**, so the **[[:en:key-terms:believer|believers]]** fled to other places. **But in spite of this**, they **[[:en:key-terms:preach|preached]]** about Jesus everywhere they went.


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **guarded their robes** - This could be translated as, “watched over their coats.” He was probably making sure they didn't get stolen or damaged. 
  * **But in spite of this** – The Jewish leaders thought they could stop the spread of Jesus' teaching by persecuting his followers. Instead, this caused them to scatter and spread the message even more widely.
