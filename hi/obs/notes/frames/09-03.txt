The **[[:en:key-terms:egypt|Egyptians]]** forced the **[[:en:key-terms:israel|Israelites]]** to build many buildings and even whole cities. The hard work made their lives **miserable**, but **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]] [[:en:key-terms:bless|blessed]] them**, and they had even more children.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **miserable** – This means that they suffered terribly because of how harshly they were treated and how hard they were forced to work. They also felt very discouraged. 
  * **God blessed them** - God took care of them, helping them endure the severe treatment and even caused them to become more numerous by giving them children.
