====== Pharaoh Refused to Obey [10-02] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-10-02.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

**[[:en:key-terms:pharaoh|Pharaoh]]** kept refusing to let **the people** go, so **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** sent **ten terrible plagues** on **[[:en:key-terms:egypt|Egypt]]**. Through these plagues, God showed Pharaoh that he is more powerful than Pharaoh and **all of Egypt's [[:en:key-terms:god-false|gods]]**.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **the people** - This refers to the people of Israel, also called, “the Israelites.” 
  * **ten terrible plagues** - A plague is something very bad or terrible that happens to someone or something. A plague usually refers to something that affects many people or happens over a large geographic area. Another word for "plague" would be "disaster."
  * **all of Egypt's gods** - It may be more clear to say, “all the gods that the Egyptian people worshiped.” The people of Egypt worshiped many different false gods. These false gods were either spirit beings that the God of Israel created, or they did not actually exist.
