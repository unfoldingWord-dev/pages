{{:en:obs:obs-33-05.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

“Other seeds fell into **[[:en:key-terms:good|good]] soil**. These seeds grew up and produced 30, 60, or even 100 times as much grain as the seed that had been planted. **He who has ears, let him hear!**”


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * (Jesus continues the story.)
  * **good soil** – That is, “fertile soil” or, “soil that was good for growing plants.” 
  * **He who has ears, let him hear!** - This saying means, “Everyone who hears what I am saying should listen to me carefully” or, “If anyone hears what I have said, he should pay attention to what I mean.” This can also be translated as a command. “Since you have ears to hear, listen carefully to what I am saying.”
