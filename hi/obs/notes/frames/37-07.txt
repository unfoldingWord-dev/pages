====== Open the Tomb [37-07] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-37-07.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

The **[[:en:key-terms:tomb|tomb]]** was a cave with a stone rolled in front of its opening. When **[[:en:key-terms:jesus|Jesus]]** arrived at the tomb, **he told them**, “**Roll the stone away**.” But **Martha** said, “**He has been [[:en:key-terms:death|dead]] for four days**. There will be a bad smell.”


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **he told them** - That is, “he told the men there.” He was probably not telling Mary and Martha to roll the stone away.
  * **Roll the stone away** - Some languages may prefer to say, “Roll the stone away from the opening of the tomb.”
  * **Martha** - Martha was the sister of Lazarus and Mary. See **[[:hi:obs:notes:frames:37-01|[37-01]]]**.
  * **He has been dead for four days** - This could also be translated as, “He died four days ago and his body is lying there.”
