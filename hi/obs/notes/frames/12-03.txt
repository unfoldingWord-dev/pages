{{:en:obs:obs-12-03.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

**After a short time**, **[[:en:key-terms:pharaoh|Pharaoh]]** and his people **changed their minds** and wanted the **[[:en:key-terms:israel|Israelites]]** to be their **[[:en:key-terms:servant|slaves]]** again. **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** caused Pharaoh to be stubborn so that people would see he is the One True God, and understand that he, Yahweh, is more powerful than Pharaoh and his **[[:en:key-terms:god-false|gods]]**.


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **After a short time** – Probably at least two days had gone by. For that to be clear, it may be translated as, “After a few days” or, “A few days after the Israelites left Egypt.” 
  * **changed their minds** - This phrase means, “began to think differently than they had before.” Some languages may not have this same expression, and will express the meaning in a direct way.
