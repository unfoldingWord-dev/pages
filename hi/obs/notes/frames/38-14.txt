{{:en:obs:obs-38-14.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

**[[:en:key-terms:judas|Judas]]** came with the **[[:en:key-terms:jewish-leaders|Jewish leaders]]**, soldiers, and a large crowd. They were carrying swords and clubs. Judas **came to** **[[:en:key-terms:jesus|Jesus]]** and said, “**Greetings**, **[[:en:key-terms:teacher|Teacher]]**,” and kissed him. This was **the sign** for the Jewish leaders to know whom to arrest. Then Jesus said, “Judas, **do you [[:en:key-terms:betray|betray]] me with a kiss**?”


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **came to** - Some languages may prefer to say, "went to."
  * **Greetings** - This can also be translated as, "Hello" or, "Peace" or, "Good evening." 
  * **the sign** - That is, "the signal."
  * **do you betray me with a kiss?** - That is, "are you really going to betray me with a kiss?" Jesus is not looking for an answer to this question. So some languages would translate it as a statement, such as, “you are betraying me by kissing me!” or, "you make your betrayal even worse by kissing me!"
