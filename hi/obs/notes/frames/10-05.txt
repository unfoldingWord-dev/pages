{{:en:obs:obs-10-05.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

So **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]] sent a plague** of **gnats**. Then he sent a plague of **flies**. **[[:en:key-terms:pharaoh|Pharaoh]]** called **[[:en:key-terms:moses|Moses]]** and **[[:en:key-terms:aaron|Aaron]]** and told them that if they stopped the plague, the **[[:en:key-terms:israel|Israelites]]** could leave Egypt. When Moses prayed, God removed all the flies from **[[:en:key-terms:egypt|Egypt]]**. But Pharaoh **hardened his heart** and would not let the people go free.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **God sent a plague** – This could be translated as, “God caused there to be a plague” or, “God caused a plague (of gnats) to come over the land of Egypt.”
  * **gnats** - These were tiny, biting insects flying in large swarms, annoying and landing on all the people and animals of Egypt. 
  * **flies** - These were much bigger flying insects that were both annoying and destructive. There were so many of these flies that they covered everything, even filling the Egyptians' houses.
  * **hardened his heart** - See note in **[[:hi:obs:notes:frames:10-04|[10-04]]]**.
