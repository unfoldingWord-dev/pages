**[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** said, “I **[[:en:key-terms:promise|promise]]** I will **never again** **[[:en:key-terms:curse|curse]]** the ground because of the **[[:en:key-terms:evil|evil]]** things that people do, or destroy the world by causing a flood, even though **people are [[:en:key-terms:sin|sinful]] from the time they are children**.”


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **never again** - This means, “not ever again” or, “not again at any time” or, “truly not again”. Examples: "I will not ever again curse the ground” or, “I will not curse the ground again at any time” or, “I will truly not curse the ground again”.
  * **curse the ground** - The earth and the other creatures suffered because of man's sin.
  * **the world** – This refers to the earth and the living creatures that lived on it.
  * **people are sinful from the time they are children** - Another way to say this would be, “people do sinful things their entire lives.”
