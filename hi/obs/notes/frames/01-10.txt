So **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** **took some dirt**, **formed it** into **a man**, and **breathed [[:en:key-terms:life|life]]** into him. This man's name was **[[:en:key-terms:adam|Adam]]**. God planted a **garden** where Adam could live, and put him there to **care for it**.


===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **took some dirt** - God made man from the dust, or dry dirt from the ground. This word should probably be different from the general word used for earth.  
    * **formed it** - This word expresses that God personally fashioned the man, comparing this to how a person creates something with his hands. Make sure that a different word from "create" is used. Note that this is very different from how he created everything else through a simple spoken command.
    * **a man** - Only the man was created at this time; the woman was created later by a different method.
    * **breathed life** - This phrase expresses God's very personal, intimate action as he transferred life from himself into Adam's body, comparing this to how a human being breathes out air. 
    * **life** - In this event, God breathed both physical and spiritual life into the man.
    * **Adam** - Adam's name is the same as the Old Testament word for "man," and similar to the word for "dirt" from which he was formed.
    * **garden** - An area of land planted with trees and plants for a purpose--usually to produce food or to provide beauty.
    * **care for it** - To maintain the garden by tending, weeding, watering, harvesting, planting, etc.
