{{:en:obs:obs-08-02.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Many years later, when **[[:en:key-terms:jacob|Jacob]]** was an old man, he **sent** his **favorite son**, **[[:en:key-terms:joseph|Joseph]]**, to **check on** his **brothers** who were **taking care of the herds**.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **sent** – This word means that Jacob told Joseph to go and Joseph went. 
  * **favorite son** - This could be translated as, “the son he loved more than any of his other children.”
  * **check on** - This means that Joseph is to go and see if everything is all right with his brothers. Some languages might say something like, "to see his brothers' well-being."
   * **brothers** - These were Joseph's older brothers. 
  * **taking care of the herds** – Since this was several days' journey away, it may be necessary to say, "who were far away taking care of.”
