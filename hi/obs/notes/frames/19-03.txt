====== God Provided for Elijah [19-03] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-19-03.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

**[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** told **[[:en:key-terms:elijah|Elijah]]** to go to a stream in **the wilderness** to hide from Ahab who wanted to kill him. Every morning and every evening, birds would bring him bread and meat. **[[:en:key-terms:ahab|Ahab]]** and his army looked for Elijah, but they could not find him. **The drought** was so severe that the stream eventually dried up.


===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **the wilderness**  - This was a remote location with very few people. This may also be translated as, "desert" or, "the bush."
    * **The drought** - This could be translated as, “the lack of rain.” This drought was a result of Elijah declaring that there would be no rain.
