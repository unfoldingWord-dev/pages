====== The Passover Lamb [48-10] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-48-10.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

**[[:en:key-terms:jesus|Jesus]]** is **our [[:en:key-terms:passover|Passover]] [[:en:key-terms:lamb|Lamb]]**. He was perfect and **sinless** and was killed at the time of the Passover celebration. When anyone **[[:en:key-terms:believe|believes]]** in Jesus, the **[[:en:key-terms:blood|blood]]** of Jesus pays for that person’s **[[:en:key-terms:sin|sin]]**, and **[[:en:key-terms:god|God's]] [[:en:key-terms:punish|punishment]] passes over that person**.


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **our Passover Lamb** - That is, “the Passover Lamb that was killed for us” or, “the lamb that was killed so that God would pass over us” or, “the lamb that was killed so that God would spare us.”
  * **sinless** - This can also be translated as, “had never sinned.”
  * **God's punishment passes over that person** - This statement means, “God does not punish that person.” Translate it using a phrase that shows its relationship to the words for "Passover" and the "Passover Lamb." If the word "spare" is used in the name of the Passover, this could also be translated as, “God spares that person from punishment.”
