====== The Passover [48-09] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-48-09.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

When **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** **sent the last plague on [[:en:key-terms:egypt|Egypt]]**, he told each **[[:en:key-terms:israel|Israelite]]** family to kill **a perfect [[:en:key-terms:lamb|lamb]]** and spread **its [[:en:key-terms:blood|blood]]** on the tops and sides of their **door frames**. When God saw the blood, he **passed over** their houses and did not kill their firstborn sons. This event is called the **[[:en:key-terms:passover|Passover]]**.


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **sent the last plague on Egypt** – That is, “caused the final disaster to come on Egypt.” This was the tenth plague when God caused the firstborn sons of the Egyptians to die.
  * **a perfect lamb** - That is, "a lamb without any defect."
  * **its blood** - That is, "the lamb's blood."
  * **door frames** – If door frames are not known, this could be translated as, “doors.”
  * **passed over** - This could also be translated as, “passed by” or, “went by.” You may want to connect how this is translated with how “Passover” is translated.
