That night, there were some **[[:en:key-terms:shepherd|shepherds]]** in a nearby field **guarding their flocks**. Suddenly, **a shining [[:en:key-terms:angel|angel]]** appeared to them, and **they were terrified**. The angel said, “**Do not be afraid**, because I have some good news for you. The **[[:en:key-terms:messiah|Messiah]]**, the **[[:en:key-terms:lord|Master]]**, has been born in **[[:en:key-terms:bethlehem|Bethlehem]]**!”


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **guarding their flocks** - A "flock" is a group of sheep. The shepherds were caring for their sheep, and protecting them from harm or theft.
  * **a shining angel** - This could also be translated as, “an angel surrounded by a bright light.” The shining light would have seemed even brighter in contrast to the darkness of the night.
  * **they were terrified** - The appearance of the supernatural angel was extremely frightening.
  * **Do not be afraid** - This often means, “stop being afraid.” The shepherds were very afraid when they saw the angel so he was telling them they did not need to be afraid.
