**One day**, a man of Israel named **[[:en:key-terms:gideon|Gideon]]** was **threshing grain secretly** so the **[[:en:key-terms:midian|Midianites]]** would not steal it. The **[[:en:key-terms:angel|angel]]** of **[[:en:key-terms:yahweh|Yahweh]]** came to Gideon and said, “**[[:en:key-terms:god|God]] is with you**, mighty warrior. Go and save **[[:en:key-terms:israel|Israel]]** from the Midianites.”


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **One day** - This phrase introduces an event that happened in the past, but does not state the specific time. Many languages have a similar way to begin telling a true story.
  * **threshing grain** - The grain was wheat, which has a head of many small grains, or seeds, on the top of a thin stalk. "Threshing" is separating the seeds of the plant from the stalks by beating the heads of grain. The seeds are food, but the stalks are not.
  * **secretly** - Gideon was threshing the grain in a hidden location, so the Midianites would not see him.
  * **God is with you** – This means, “God is present with you in a special way” or, "God has plans to use you in a special way."
