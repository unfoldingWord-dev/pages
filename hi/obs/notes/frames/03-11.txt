Later **[[:en:key-terms:noah|Noah]]** sent out a bird called a **dove**. But it also could not find any dry land, so it came back to Noah. A week later he sent the dove out again, and it came back with an **olive branch** in its beak! **The water was going down**, and the plants were growing again!


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **dove** - A small, white or gray flying bird that eats seeds or fruit.
  * **olive branch** - An olive tree's fruit contains oil which people use for cooking or putting on their skin. If your language does not have a word for “olive branch,” you could translate it as, “branch from a tree called 'olive'” or, “branch from an oil-tree.”
  * **water was going down** - It may be more natural in your language to say that, “the water was going away” or, “the level of the water was getting lower.”
