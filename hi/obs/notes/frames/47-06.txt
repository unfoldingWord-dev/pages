The men who owned the **[[:en:key-terms:servant|slave girl]]** became very angry! They realized that **without the demon**, the slave girl could not tell people **the future**. **This meant that** people would no longer pay her owners money so that she would tell them what would happen to them.


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **without the demon** - That is, "without the power from the demon" or, "now that she did not have the demon."
  * **the future** - That is, "what would happen to them in the future."
  * **This meant that** - This could also be translated as, “Because of this” or, "Therefore."
