{{:en:obs:obs-14-14.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

After the **[[:en:key-terms:israel|Israelites]]** had wandered in the wilderness for forty years, all of them  **who had [[:en:key-terms:rebel|rebelled]] against [[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** were dead. Then God led **the people** to the edge of the **[[:en:key-terms:promised-land|Promised Land]]** again. **[[:en:key-terms:moses|Moses]]** was now very old, so God chose **[[:en:key-terms:joshua|Joshua]]** to help him lead the people. God also **[[:en:key-terms:promise|promised]]** Moses that **one day**, he would send **another [[:en:key-terms:prophet|prophet]] like Moses**.


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **who had rebelled against God** - This could be translated, "who had refused to obey God when he told them to go into the Promised Land." 
  * **the people** - That is, the children of the generation that died.
  * **one day** - This means, "some time in the future."
  * **another prophet like Moses** - Like Moses, this man would be an Israelite, he would speak God's words to the people, and he would lead the people.
