The **[[:en:key-terms:disciple|disciples]]** did not understand the meaning of the story, so they asked **[[:en:key-terms:jesus|Jesus]]** to explain it to them. Jesus said, “The man who planted the **[[:en:key-terms:good|good]]** seed represents the **[[:en:key-terms:messiah|Messiah]]**. The field represents the world. The good seed represents **the people of [[:en:key-terms:kingdom-of-god|God’s kingdom]]**.”
