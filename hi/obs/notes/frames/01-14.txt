When **[[:en:key-terms:adam|Adam]]** saw her, he said, "**At last**! This one is **like me**! Let her be called '**Woman**,' for she was **made from Man**." This is why **a man leaves** his father and mother and **becomes one** with his wife.


===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **At last!** - Adam's exclamation indicates that he had been waiting for something like the woman. 
    * **like me** - The woman was the same type of being as Adam, even though there were important differences between them.
    * **Woman** - This word is the feminine form of the word for man.
    * **made from man** - The woman was formed directly from Adam's own body.
    * **a man leaves** - This is stated in the present tense to indicate what would become the normal situation in the future. Adam did not have a mother or father, but all other men would.
    * **becomes one** - The husband and wife will share an intimate bond of unity and a commitment to one another that will surpass their relationships to anyone else.
