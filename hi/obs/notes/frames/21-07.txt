===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **on behalf of** - This may be translated as, "for the benefit of" or, "in the place of."
  * **as a substitute for the punishment for their sins** - God allowed people to bring animals to sacrifice for their sin as a reminder of the punishment that they deserved and their dependence on God to remove their sin. God accepted these sacrifices as a temporary covering for sin and did not punish the people for it. 
  * **perfect high priest** - Unlike the other high priests, the Messiah would never sin, and he would permanently take away all the sins of the people. 
  * **offer himself** – That is, “allow himself to be killed.”
  * **perfect sacrifice** - That is, “a sacrifice that has no fault or imperfection.”
