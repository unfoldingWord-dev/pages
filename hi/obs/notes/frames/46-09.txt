{{:en:obs:obs-46-09.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Some believers who fled from the **[[:en:key-terms:persecute|persecution]]** in **[[:en:key-terms:jerusalem|Jerusalem]]** went far away to the **city of Antioch** and preached about **[[:en:key-terms:jesus|Jesus]]**. Most of the people in Antioch were not **[[:en:key-terms:jew|Jews]]**, but for the first time, very many of them also became believers. **[[:en:key-terms:barnabas|Barnabas]]** and **[[:en:key-terms:paul|Saul]]** went there to teach these new believers more about Jesus and to **strengthen the [[:en:key-terms:church|church]]**.  It was at Antioch that believers in Jesus were first called "**[[:en:key-terms:christian|Christians]]**."
