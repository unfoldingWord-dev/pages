  * **the unbelieving Jewish leaders** - That is, "the Jewish leaders who did not believe in Jesus."
  * **That liar, Jesus, said** – This could also be translated as, “That man, Jesus, lied and said." They refused to believe that Jesus told the truth about being the Son of God.
  * **rise from the dead** - That is, “come back to life” or, “become alive again.”
