====== The Perfect Creation [48-01] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-48-01.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

When **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]] created the world**, everything was **perfect**. **There was no [[:en:key-terms:sin|sin]]**. **[[:en:key-terms:adam|Adam]]** and **[[:en:key-terms:eve|Eve]]** **[[:en:key-terms:love|loved]]** each other, and they loved God. **There was no sickness or [[:en:key-terms:death|death]]**. This was the way God wanted the world to be.


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **God created the world** - That is, "God made the world out of nothing."
  * **perfect** - That is, "exactly as it should be" to accomplish all that God intended for it.
  * **There was no sin** - For some languages it is not possible to express “sin” as a thing, rather it is an action. In those cases this could be translated as, “No one ever sinned” or, “People did not sin” or, “Nothing evil had happened.”
  * **There was no sickness or death** - That is, “No one got sick and no one died” or, “They did not get sick or die.”
