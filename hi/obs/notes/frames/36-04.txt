{{:en:obs:obs-36-04.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

As **[[:en:key-terms:moses|Moses]]** and **[[:en:key-terms:elijah|Elijah]]** were talking with **[[:en:key-terms:jesus|Jesus]]**, **[[:en:key-terms:peter|Peter]]** said to Jesus, "It is **[[:en:key-terms:good|good]]** for us to be here. Let us make three **shelters**, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.” Peter **did not know what he was saying**.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **shelters** - This can also be translated as, “lean-tos” or, “garden huts” or, “tents.” It refers to small, individual, temporary shelters, like the Jews made from tree branches during an annual Jewish holiday. 
  * **did not know what he was saying** -  That is, “was speaking without understanding what was happening” or, “spoke without thinking clearly because he was so excited.”
