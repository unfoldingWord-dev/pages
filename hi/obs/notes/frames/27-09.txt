====== Help for the Victim [27-09] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-27-09.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

“The **[[:en:key-terms:samaria|Samaritan]]** then lifted the man onto **his own donkey** and took him to a **roadside inn** **where he took care of him**.”


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * (Jesus continues to tell the story.)
  * **his own donkey** – Make sure it is clear that “his” refers to the Samaritan. 
  * **roadside inn** – That is, “a lodging place.” This is a place where travelers could get food and stay overnight. 
  * **where he took care of him** – This could also be translated as, “where he continued to take care of him.”
