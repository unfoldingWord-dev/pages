He will throw Satan into **[[:en:key-terms:hell|hell]]** where he will burn forever, along with everyone who chose to follow him rather than to **[[:en:key-terms:obey|obey]]** **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]**.

  * **his kingdom** - This could also be translated as, “Satan's evil rule over people” or, “all the evil things he does and the evil people he controls.”
  * **rather than** - That is, "instead of."
