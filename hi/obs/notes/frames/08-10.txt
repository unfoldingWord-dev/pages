===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **Egypt, but also Canaan** – For some languages it may be clearer or more natural to say, “the country of Egypt, but also the land of Canaan.”
  * **The famine was severe** - The famine was very bad. There was very little food and many people outside of Egypt were starving.
