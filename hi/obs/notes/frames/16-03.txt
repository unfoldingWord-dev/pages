Then **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]] provided** a **[[:en:key-terms:deliverer|deliverer]]** who rescued them from their enemies and **brought [[:en:key-terms:peace|peace]]** to **the land**. But then **the people forgot about God** and started **[[:en:key-terms:worship|worshiping]]** **[[:en:key-terms:idol|idols]]** again. So God allowed the **[[:en:key-terms:midian|Midianites]]**, a nearby enemy people group, to defeat them.
