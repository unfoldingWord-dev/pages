The soldiers brought **[[:en:key-terms:jesus|Jesus]]** to a place called “**the Skull**” and nailed his arms and feet to the **[[:en:key-terms:cross|cross]]**. But Jesus said, “**[[:en:key-terms:god-father|Father]]**, **[[:en:key-terms:forgive|forgive]] them, because they do not know what they are doing**.” **[[:en:key-terms:pilate|Pilate]]** commanded that they write, “**[[:en:key-terms:king-of-jews|King of the Jews]]**” on a sign  and put it on the cross above Jesus’ head.


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **the Skull** - A hill near Jerusalem with a white, rocky top that was shaped somewhat like the top of a skull. 
  * **forgive them, because they do not know what they are doing** - That is, “they do not understand the meaning of what they are doing, so please forgive them.” The soldiers thought Jesus was only a criminal who deserved to die. They did not understand that he was the Son of God.
