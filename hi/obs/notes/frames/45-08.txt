When Philip **approached the [[:en:key-terms:chariot|chariot]]**, he heard the **Ethiopian** reading from what the **[[:en:key-terms:isaiah|prophet Isaiah]]** wrote. The man read, “They led him like a **[[:en:key-terms:lamb|lamb]]** to be killed, and **as a lamb is silent**, he did not say a word. They treated him unfairly and did not respect him. **They took his [[:en:key-terms:life|life]] away from him**.”
