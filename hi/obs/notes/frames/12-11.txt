After the **[[:en:key-terms:israel|Israelites]]** all **made it safely to the other side** of the sea, **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** told **[[:en:key-terms:moses|Moses]]** to **stretch out his arm again**. When he obeyed, the **water fell on the [[:en:key-terms:egypt|Egyptian]] army** and **returned to its normal place**. **The whole Egyptian army** drowned.
