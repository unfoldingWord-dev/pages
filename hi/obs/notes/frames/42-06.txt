{{:en:obs:obs-42-06.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

As the **[[:en:key-terms:disciple|disciples]]** were talking, **[[:en:key-terms:jesus|Jesus]]** suddenly appeared in the room with them and said, “**[[:en:key-terms:peace|Peace]] to you**!" The **[[:en:key-terms:disciple|disciples]]** thought he was a **ghost**, but Jesus said, "Why are you afraid and **doubting**? Look at my hands and feet. Ghosts do not have bodies like I do.” **To prove** that he was not a ghost, he asked for something to eat. They gave him a piece of cooked fish, and he ate it.
