Then **[[:en:key-terms:gideon|Gideon]]** returned to his soldiers and gave each of them a **horn**, a clay pot, and **a torch**. They surrounded the camp where the **[[:en:key-terms:midian|Midianite]]** soldiers were sleeping. Gideon's 300 men soldiers had the torches in the pots so the Midianites could not see the light of the torches.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **horn** - This could be translated as, “trumpet” or, “ram's horn trumpet.” These horns came from a male sheep and were often used to call men for battle. 
  * **a torch** - This was probably a piece of wood wrapped with cloth and soaked in oil so that it could burn well. (This was not the modern torch that runs on batteries.)
