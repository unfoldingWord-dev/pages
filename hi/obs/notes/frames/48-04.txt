{{:en:obs:obs-48-04.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

**[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** **[[:en:key-terms:promise|promised]]** that one of **[[:en:key-terms:eve|Eve's]]** 
**[[:en:key-terms:descendant|descendants]]** would **crush [[:en:key-terms:satan|Satan's]] head**, and Satan would **wound his heel**. This meant that Satan would kill the **[[:en:key-terms:messiah|Messiah]]**, but God would **[[:en:key-terms:raise|raise]] him to [[:en:key-terms:life|life]] again**, and then the Messiah will crush the power of Satan forever. Many years later, God revealed that **[[:en:key-terms:jesus|Jesus]]** is the Messiah.


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **crush Satan's head** - This could also be translated as, “step on Satan's head and smash it down flat” or, “shatter Satan's head by stepping on it.” This is an image of a person stepping on the head of a snake. The head is completely crushed, and the snake is dead and therefore harmless.
  * **wound his heel** - This is an image of a snake on the ground biting a person's foot. In this case, Satan would cause the Messiah to suffer, but would not destroy him.
  * **raise him to life again** - That is, "make him alive again."
