**After that**, **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]] sent hail** that destroyed most of the crops in **[[:en:key-terms:egypt|Egypt]]** and killed anybody who went outside. **[[:en:key-terms:pharaoh|Pharaoh]]** called **[[:en:key-terms:moses|Moses]]** and **[[:en:key-terms:aaron|Aaron]]** and told them, “I have **[[:en:key-terms:sin|sinned]]**. **You may go**.” So Moses **[[:en:key-terms:pray|prayed]]**, and the hail stopped falling from the sky.

  * **God sent hail** - God caused hail to fall from the sky. 
  * **hail** - Hail is like chunks of ice that fall down from the clouds as rain does. These chunks can be very small or very large. The larger ones will hurt or kill whatever they fall on.
