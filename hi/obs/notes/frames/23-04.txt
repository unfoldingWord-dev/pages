**When the time was near for [[:en:key-terms:mary|Mary]] to give birth**, the **[[:en:key-terms:rome|Roman]] government** told everyone to go **for a census** to the town where their ancestors had lived. **[[:en:key-terms:joseph-nt|Joseph]]** and Mary had to make a long journey from where they lived in **[[:en:key-terms:nazareth|Nazareth]]** to **[[:en:key-terms:bethlehem|Bethlehem]]** because their ancestor was **[[:en:key-terms:david|David]]** whose hometown was Bethlehem.


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **When the time was near for Mary to give birth** - That is, “When it was near the end of Mary's pregnancy.”
  * **Roman government** - Rome had conquered and ruled over Israel at this time.
  * **for a census** - That is, “to be counted for the government record” or, “so that the government could write their names on a list” or, “to be counted by the government.” This census was probably made for the purpose of taxing the people.
