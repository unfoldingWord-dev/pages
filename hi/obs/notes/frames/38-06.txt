Then **[[:en:key-terms:jesus|Jesus]]** said to the **[[:en:key-terms:disciple|disciples]]**, “One of you will **[[:en:key-terms:betray|betray]]** me.” The disciples were shocked, and asked who would do such a thing. Jesus said, “The person to whom I give this piece of bread **is the betrayer**.” Then he gave the bread to **[[:en:key-terms:judas|Judas]]**.


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **give this piece of bread** – That is, “hand this piece of bread.” 
  * **is the betrayer** - This could also be translated as, "will betray me" or, “is the one who will betray me.”
