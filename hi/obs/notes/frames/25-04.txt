  * **throw yourself down** - That is, “jump off this building to the ground.” 
  * **it is written** – That is, “a prophet of God wrote long ago.” 
  * ** so your foot does not hit a stone** - This means, “so that you will not be hurt at all; not even your foot will be injured on a stone.” It could also be translated as, “so that even your foot will not strike against a stone; you will not be injured at all.”
