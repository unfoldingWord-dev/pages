The woman saw that the fruit was beautiful and looked delicious. She also wanted to be **[[:en:key-terms:wise|wise]]**, so she picked some of the fruit and ate it. Then she gave some to her husband, **who was with her**, and he ate it, too.

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **wise** - The woman wanted to have insight and understanding like the snake seemed to have, and like God has.
    * **who was with her** - This is important information because it shows that the man was present when the woman made the decision to eat the fruit.
