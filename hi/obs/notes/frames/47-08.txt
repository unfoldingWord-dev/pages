  * **in the middle of the night** – This could be translated as, “very late at night" or, "very early in the morning.” This was when it was completely dark outside, when people would normally be asleep.
  * **singing songs of praise to God** - This can also be translating as, “praising God by singing” or, "singing songs to praise God” or, “singing songs that gave praise to God.”
