====== 36. The Transfiguration ======


===== Overview: =====


Jesus took Peter, James and John up a high mountain. While Jesus was praying there, his face and clothes became to shine. Moses and Elijah appeared and talked to Jesus about his death. The disciples were amazed when they saw this. Then a voice from heaven said “This is my Son whom I love.” But Jesus told them not to tell anyone what happened until after he was raised from the dead.
