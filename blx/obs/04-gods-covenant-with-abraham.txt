Many years after the flood, there were again many people in the world, and they all spoke the same language. But the people did not obey God. Instead of having children and filling the earth, they gathered together and built a city.

Malakêy nay panawun na inlumibas paubat sabaytun pinalanab Bapan Namalyari ya babun luta. Amêsên, inlumakêy nay na man ya mani tawu baydi sa babun luta buy gigisa pun na sabi la. Nuwa a sila manunul sa utus Bapan Namalyari ya maku sila sa kaganawan lugal baydi sa babun luta.

They were very proud, and they did not care about what God said. They even began building a tall tower to reach heaven. God saw that if they all kept working together, they could do many evil things.

Mayabang sila. Kabay niaawyun sila amên mamipaydêng un matag-ay ya tore ya miangga sa langit. Sên nakit Bapan Namalyari ya ati, tanda nay kadustakan kanay ati. Kabay tanda nay mas malakê pun lanu ya madyag lay nadawak.

So He changed their language into many different languages and spread the people out all over the world. The city they had begun to build was called Babel, which means “confused.”

Buy ya dinyag nan Bapan Namalyari, pikakaatag nay sabin mani tawu ta amên a sila mikakaintindi. Buy nisisyay sila gawan a silayna mangapipupukat. Kabay nangapisisyay silan naku sa mani lugal.

Hundreds of years later, God spoke to a man named Abram. God told him, “Leave your country and family and go to the land I will show you.”


Amêsên, sên pamakayari un dinalan na tawun, dilag gisay liyaki ya naglagyun un Abram. Buy ya lagyu un asawa na, Sarai. Buy si Abram, pikisabyan na yan Bapan Namalyari, ya sinabi na, “Lakwanan muy lugal mu buy mani kamag-anak mu buy maku kaw miasawa sa lugal la ipakit ku kamu.”

So Abram obeyed. He took his wife, Sarai, and all his servants and herds of animals and went to the land God showed him, the land of Canaan. Abram lived there for many years. There God made a covenant with Abram. A covenant is an agreement between two parties.

Si Abram buy asawa na, namita silay nan papakun sa lugal la impakit nan Bapan Namalyari kalla. Sên pamakalatêng la baydu, nagpangaku si Bapan Namalyari kana, ya sinabi na, “Ati ya kaganawan na mani lugal la makit mu, idin ku kamu amên paglugal mani layi mu.

God said, “Look all around you. All the land that you can see I will give to you and your descendants as an inheritance. I will bless you and make your name great.”

Buy silay mani layi mu, palak-ên ku buy magin silan maragul la bansa. Buy sikuy Bapan mun Namalyari. Pagpalên kata ta amên matandan kaganawan tawu ya lagyu mu.

“I will make your descendants into a large nation, and I will be your God. I will bless those who bless you and curse those who curse you. All the people groups of the world will be blessed through you.” God also told Abram to circumcise all the men in his household as a sign of the covenant. Abram obeyed.

Buy pagpalên kuy mani tawuy nanyag mangêd kamu, nuwa silay manubuy kamu, tubuyan ku sila êt abitu silay manyag nadawak kamu. A ku sila pagpalên. Buy sa kapamilatan layi mu, pagpalên kuy kaganawan na mani bansa.”

Abram believed God. God said that Abram was righteous through believing in God’s promise. But there was a problem. Abram and his wife were not able to have any children. So it seemed impossible that Abram could become the father of a large nation, but they waited in faith, believing what God had promised.

Buy inisip nan Abram, “Manampalataya yakuy tuparên Bapan Namalyari ya kaganawan na pangaku na kangku.” Kabay sinabin Bapan Namalyari kan Abram, “Gawan sa panampalataya mu kangku, pan-ituwad katan matinêk”, sinabi na. Nuwa ayin sila pun anak. Buy nu parabaydu, parasaantu awêd matupad da pangakun Bapan Namalyari ya si Abram ya pangubatan un maragul la bansa?

One day, Abram met Melchizedek, the priest of God Most High. Melchizedek blessed Abram and said, “May God Most High who owns heaven and earth bless Abram.” Then Abram gave Melchizedek a tenth of all he owned.
