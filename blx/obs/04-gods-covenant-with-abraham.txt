Many years after the flood, there were again many people in the world, and they all spoke the same language. But the people did not obey God. Instead of having children and filling the earth, they gathered together and built a city.


Nabuyut tinay panawun ya pangayarin lanab. Amêsên, linumakê nay na man ya mani tawu baydi sa babun luta buy gigisa pun ya klasin sabi la. Nuwa a sila manunul sa utus nan Bapan Namalyari ya kumalat silan maku sa kaganawan na mani lugal sa babun luta.

They were very proud, and they did not care about what God said. They even began building a tall tower to reach heaven. God saw that if they all kept working together, they could do many evil things.

Mayabang sila. Kabay nagigisan sila amên mamipaydêng un matag-ay ya baag. Ta ati ya matag-ay ya baag, labay la yan makalatêng sa langit. Sên nakit nan Bapan Namalyari ati, tanda na, ya kadustakan kana ati. Kabay pan-asaan na ya mas malakê pun lanu ya madyag lan narawak.

So He changed their language into many different languages and spread the people out all over the world. The city they had begun to build was called Babel, which means “confused.”

Buy ya dinyag nan Bapan Namalyari, pinasabi na silan malakê ya klasin mani sabi ta amên silay na a mapukatan. Buy nagigisa silay na. Buy gawan sa a la mapukatan, kinumalat silay nan naku sa kaatag ga mani lugal.

Hundreds of years later, God spoke to a man named Abram. God told him, “Leave your country and family and go to the land I will show you.”


Amêsên, sên pamakayari un dinalan ya tawun, dilag gisay liyaki ya naglagyun un Abram. Buy ya lagyu un asawa na, Sarai. Buy si Abram, pikisabyan na yan Bapan Namalyari, ya sinabi na, “Lakwanan muy lugal mu buy mani kamag-anak mu, ta maku kaw miasawa sa lugal ya ipakit ku kamu.”

So Abram obeyed. He took his wife, Sarai, and all his servants and herds of animals and went to the land God showed him, the land of Canaan. Abram lived there for many years. There God made a covenant with Abram. A covenant is an agreement between two parties.

Buy si Abram buy asawa na, namita silay nan papakun sa lugal ya ipakit nan Bapan Namalyari kalla. Sên pamakalatêng la baydu, nagpangaku si Bapan Namalyari kana, ya sinabi na, “Ati ya kaganawan na mani lugal la makit mu, idin ku kamu ya manaên mani layi mu.

God said, “Look all around you. All the land that you can see I will give to you and your descendants as an inheritance. I will bless you and make your name great.”

Buy silay mani layi mu, palakên ku sila buy magin silan maragul la bansa. Buy sikuy amêsên ya Bapan Namalyari yu. Buy pagpalên kata ta amên la matandan un malakêy tawu ya lagyu mu.

“I will make your descendants into a large nation, and I will be your God. I will bless those who bless you and curse those who curse you. All the people groups of the world will be blessed through you.” God also told Abram to circumcise all the men in his household as a sign of the covenant. Abram obeyed.

Buy pagpalên ku sila êt ya mamipala kamu, nuwa silay manubuy kamu, tubuyan ku sila êt. Buy sa kapamilatan sa mani layi mu ya pagpalên ku, pagpalên ku sila êt ya kaganawan na mani bansa.”

Abram believed God. God said that Abram was righteous through believing in God’s promise. But there was a problem. Abram and his wife were not able to have any children. So it seemed impossible that Abram could become the father of a large nation, but they waited in faith, believing what God had promised.

Buy inisip nan Abram, “Maniwala aku ya tuparên nan Bapan Namalyari ya kaganawan na pangaku na kangku.” Kabay sinabi nan Bapan Namalyari kan Abram, “Gawan sa panampalataya mu kangku, pan-ituwad katan matinêk”, sinabi na. Nuwa ya kasakit, ayin sila pun anak. Buy nu parabaydu, parasaantu awêd ya matupad ya pangaku nan Bapan Namalyari ya si Abram ya pangubatan un maragul la bansa?

One day, Abram met Melchizedek, the priest of God Most High. Melchizedek blessed Abram and said, “May God Most High who owns heaven and earth bless Abram.” Then Abram gave Melchizedek a tenth of all he owned.
