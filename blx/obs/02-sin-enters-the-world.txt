====== 2. Ya Tawuy Pinangubatan Kasalanan ======

Adam and his wife were very happy living in the beautiful garden God had made for them. Neither of them wore clothes, but this did not cause them to feel any shame, because there was no sin in the world. They often walked in the garden and talked with God.

Sadyay tulan Adan buy asawa na. Nanugêl sila sa mangêd da panamnan ya dinyag Bapan Namalyari para kalla. Ayin silang yaming, nuwa asila madêng-êyan, gawan ayin pun kasalanan sa babun luta. Pawa silan maglimbun sa panamnan buy pawa silan makisabi kan Bapan Namalyari.

But there was a crafty snake in the garden. He asked the woman, “Did God really tell you not to eat the fruit from any of the trees in the garden?”

Nuwa dilag gisay utan na malaram ya idi sa panamnan. Gisay allu, pinatang nay babayi, “Pêtêg nayin sinabin Bapan Namalyari kamuyuy akaw mangan agyan dakun sabêt ta tagêy puun kayu diyê?”

The woman answered, “God told us we could eat the fruit of any tree except from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. God told us, ‘If you eat that fruit or even touch it, you will die.’”


Nakitbay ya babayi, “Te ase, malyari kay mangan dakun sabêt ta tagêy puun kayu di, alwa ta dayin tagêy puun kayun mam-in kabiyasnan tungkul sa mangêd buy nadawak. Sinabin Bapan Namalyari kanyan, 'Agana yu kanên na abitu, o talanên, ta mati kaw.'”

The snake responded, “That is not true! You will not die. God knows that as soon as you eat it, you will be like God and will understand good and evil like he does.”

Nakitbay ya utan, “Asê pêtêg ga abaytu! Akaw mati. Kay ana labay ipakan kamuyuy tagêy ya abitu gawan nu kinnan yuy abaytu, matandan yu nu sabêt ta mangêd buy nadawak. Parakawnan kaparisun Bapan Namalyari.”

The woman saw that the fruit was beautiful and looked delicious. She also wanted to be wise, so she picked some of the fruit and ate it. Then she gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it, too. 

Amêsên, labay labay yan babayin matawayan na tagêy gawan mangêd êlêwên na ati. Kalabay yan mabiyasa kabay namuti yan tagêy buy kinnan nay ati. Binyanan na êt ta asawa na buy nangan ya êt.

Suddenly, their eyes were opened, and they realized they were naked. They tried to cover their bodies by sewing leaves together to make clothes.

Sa dinyag lan abaytu dilag nalyari kalla. Nakitan lay ayin sila awêd yaming. Kabay si dinyag la nanyag silan yaming nga ubat sa bulung kayu ya pinanakêp lan lawini la.

Then the man and his wife heard the sound of God walking through the garden. They both hid from God. Then God called to the man, “Where are you?” Adam replied, “I heard you walking in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked. So I hid.” 

Sên kaawat tana, nalêngên miasaway mamita si Bapan Namalyari sa panamnan. Kabay nagtagu sila. Binêg Bapan Namalyari ya liyaki, “Adan, antukay na?” Nakitbay si Adan, “ Nalêngê kuy mamita ka sa panamnan. Kabay nalimu waku kamu gawan ayin nakun yaming buy nagtagu waku.”

Then God asked, “Who told you that you were naked? Did you eat the fruit I told you not to eat?” The man answered, “You gave me this woman, and she gave me the fruit.” Then God asked the woman, “What have you done?” The woman replied, “The snake tricked me.”

Pinatang yan Bapan Namalyari, “Sisabêt ta nagsabin ayin kan yaming? Nangan ka nayin tagêy ya aku labay ipakan kamuyu?” Nakitbay si Adan, “Pinakan nakun babayi ya indin mu.” Pinatang Bapan Namalyari ya babayi, “Uysiyan dinyag mu yay abitu ta?” Nakitbay ya babayi nadyag kuy abitu gawan tinalipanpanan nakun utan.”

God said to the snake, “You are cursed! You will slide on your belly and eat dirt. You and the woman will hate each other, and your children and her children will hate each other, too. The woman’s descendant will crush your head, and you will wound his heel.”

Sinabin Bapan Namalyari sa utan, “Gawan sa dinyag mu, pan-isumpa kata. Dumakap ka buy kay abuy kanên mu. Mipati kaw buy babayi. Pati ya mani anak yu mipati êt. Ya anak babayi sabay ya mallasaw ulu mu. Sika êt ta manuktuk waêng na.”

God then said to the woman, “I will make childbirth very painful for you. You will desire your husband, and he will rule over you.”

Sinabin Bapan Namalyari sa babayi, “Sa panganak mu magkasakit ka. Kaidwan-muy asawa mu buy sunulun mu ya.

God said to the man, “You listened to your wife and disobeyed me. Now the ground is cursed, and you will need to work hard to grow food. Then you will die, and your body will return to dirt.” The man named his wife Eve, which means “life-giver,” because she would become the mother of all people. And God clothed Adam and Eve with animal skins.

Sinabi yaman Bapan Namalyari sa liyaki, “Gawan sinunul muy asawa mu kaysa kangku, isumpa kuy lutay panggitnan mu. Magkasakit kay napun bayu ka mamupul sa intanêm mu. Buy nu mati ka, mag-udung sa lutay lawini mu.” Ebay inbêg Adan sa asawa na. Ya labay sabin Eba “mam-in biyay” gawan si Ebay mapag-indun kaganawan tawu. Binyanan naman Bapan Namalyarin yaming si Adan buy si Eba. Dyag sa balat ayup pa yaming nga indin na kalla.

Then God said, “Now that the human beings have become like us by knowing good and evil, they must not be allowed to eat the fruit of the tree of life and live forever.” So God sent Adam and Eve away from the beautiful garden. God placed large, powerful angels at the entrance to the garden to keep anyone from eating the fruit of the tree of life.

Sinabin Bapan Namalyari, “Kaparisu tamina amêsên na mani tawu, tanda lay nay mangêd buy nadawak. Dapat asilay na makaêkan tagêy puun kayuy mam-in biyay ta dat asilay na mati.” Kabay inpatas Bapan Namalyari si Adan buy si Eba sa mangêd da panamnan. Mam-i ya êt mangaragul buy mangalakas sa mani ang-el sa dadanan palaku sa panamnan ta amên bênbênan na mani tawun makaên tagêy puun kayuy mam-in biyay.
