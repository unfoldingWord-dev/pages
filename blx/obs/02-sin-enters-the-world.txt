The man and the woman, they both were naked and they had no shame to each other.

Ya liyaki buy babayi, parisu silan ayin yaming buy a sila mikadêng-êy.

But there was a crafty snake in the garden. He asked the woman, “Did God really tell you not to eat the fruit from the trees in the garden?”

Amêsên, si Satanas, napakadyag yan utan. Katanda yan manyag dan papakun sa kadawakan. Buy si Satanas, nakit na si Eva ya ayin awyun. Nagdani ya kana ta sinabi na, “Si Bapan Namalyari nayi ya namawal kamuyun mangan un tagêy kayu sa kaganawan na kayu ya anti baydi?”

Eva answered, “The fruit,” she said, “of all trees, we(excl) can eat it.  But the fruit of that tree giving the knowing-of about good and evil, we(excl) can not eat or touch because God said that if we(excl) will-eat that, we(excl) will-die.”

Ya babayi ya naglagyun Eva, nakitbay ya, “Ya tagêy un kaganawan un tagêy kayu, malyari yan kanên. Nuwa ya tagêy un abiin na kayun mam-in kabiyasnan un tungkul sa mangêd buy narawak, a yan malyarin kanên buy a yan ya malyarin gêgtan ta sinabi un Bapan Namalyari ya nu mangan kay abiin na tagêy, mati kay.”

Now, the snake said to Eva, “You(PL) will- not -die,” it said, “ if  you eat that fruit.  And if you(PL) will-eat that fruit, you(PL) will–know good and evil like God.”  

Amêsên, sinabi nan utan kan Eva,  “A kaw mati nu mangan kaw un abiin na tagêy. Buy nu mangan kaw abiin, matandan yu ya mangêd buy narawak kaparisu kan Bapan Namalyari.”

Now when Eva saw that beautiful fruit, she picked one because she ate, then she took still one fruit because she will-give to-cause- Adan also –to-eat.  

Amêsên, sa nakit nan Eva abaytu ya mangêd da tagêy, namuti yan gisa ta kinnan na. Nangwa ya pun gisany tagêy ta inpakan na êt kan Adan na pagkaawyun na.

When they had finished eating that fruit of the tree, they knew now that they are-naked.  Therefore they took leaves of trees because they sewed-together to cover their bodies.

Sên nayari silan nangan un abituy tagêy kayu, natandan layna ya ayin yaming sila. Buy nangwa silan bulung kayu ta tinayi la ta pamanpan sa lawini la.

When afternoon arrived, they heard the voice of God.  Adan and Eva, they hurried to hide being-covered-up in the trees.  But they heard God call, he said, “Adan, where are you?” Adan answered, “I am here hiding,” he said.  “I am-afraid of you, and I ashamed because I am naked.”  

Sa kaawat, nalêngê lay tunuy  Bapan Namalyari. Si Adan buy si Eva, namaras silan nagtagu sa mani puun kayu. Nuwa nalêngê la ya tunuy Bapan Namalyari, ya sinabi na, “Adan, saantu kayna?” Nakitbay si Adan, “Anti yaku baydi ya nagtagu. Malimu waku kamu buy marêngêy yaku ta ayin nakun yaming.”

Now, God asked him, “Who,” he said, “said to you that you are-naked? Did you eat the fruit of the tree that I forbid you(PL) to eat?” Adan answered, “The woman,” he said, “which you gave to accompany me.  She is the one who gave to me the fruit which I ate.”  God spoke to Eva, he said, “Why, did you do like that?” Eva answered, “I was-deceived by the snake,” she said, “because he caused- me –to-take that fruit of the tree then I ate.”

Amêsên, pinatang na yan Bapan Namalyari, “Sisabêt ta nagsabi kamu ya ayin kan yaming? Nangan ka nayi un tagêy kayun imbawal ku kamuyun kanên?" Nakitbay si Adan, sinabi na, "Si babayi ya indin mun pagkaawyun ku, sabay ya nam-i kangkun tagêy ya kinnan ku.” Sinabin Bapan Namalyari kan Eva, “Awta ta dinyag muy parabaydu ta?” Nakitbay si Eva, ya sinabi na, “Inluku wakun utan ta pinakwa na kun tagêy kayu bayu ku kinnan.”

God said to the snake, “Not good,” he said, “is what you did; therefore from now on your stomach is what you will-walk-on.  You and this woman I will-cause-to-fight-each-other.  The descendent of this woman, he is the one who will-crush/pound your head; you also will-sneak-up to bite his feet.”

Sinabin Bapan Namalyari sa utan,  “Alwan mangêd ya dinyag mu. Kabay ubat amêsên, ya bituka mu ya igapang mu. Ati ya babayi ya magin kapati mu. Si anak nan ati ya babayi, sabay ya mamatuk un ulu mu buy sika ya utan, manduyung kan mangayat sa bitis na.”

Now, the Lord God said to the woman, “I will-add-to,” he said, “the difficulty of your giving birth.  You will-be-under your husband and you will-follow him.”

Amêsên, sinabi nan Bapan Bapan Namalyari sa babayi, “Magkasakit kan manganak. Pasakup ka sa asawa mu buy sumunul ka kana.”

{{:en:obs:obs-02-11.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

The Lord God said to the male, “You listened,” he said, “to your wife and you ate that fruit of the tree which I forbid for you(PL) to eat-from.  Therefore from now on you will-sweat working for your living everyday, and many thorns will-grow on your land which will-be-difficult for you.  Your body is from the ground and it will-return again to the ground.” Now, God made their clothes from the skins of animals.

Sinabin Bapan Namalyari sa liyaki, “Nallêngê ka sa asawa mu buy nangan kan abituy tagêy kayu ya imbawal ku kamun kanên. Kabay ubat amêsên, manayngêt kan mag-obra sa pangabyayan yu sa inallu-allu. Malakê ya diwi ya managêy sa luta yu ya mamasakit kamu. Ya lawini mun ubat sa luta buy mag-urung ya êt sa luta.” Amêsên, si Bapan Namalyari, nanyag yan yaming ya ubat sa balat un saysay.

The Lord God still spoke, he said, “People now, have-become like us(incl), because their sin which they did, they became knowing-of about good and evil.  Therefore so-that they will- not –eat the fruit of that tree giving life, they will-be-caused-to-leave here in this place,” said the Lord God.

Sinabi na pun Bapan Namalyari, “Si tawu amêsên, kaparisu yina kantamu ta gawan sa kasalanan la, nabiyan silan kabiyasnan ya tungkul sa mangêd buy narawak. Buy amêsên, ipatas ku sila sa lugal la ati ta amên a sila makaêkan un tagêy kayu ya mam-in biyay”, sinabin Bapan Namalyari.
