After Joseph died, all of his relatives stayed in Egypt. They and their descendants continued to live there for many years and had many children. They were called the Israelites.


Pangayarin pangamatin Jose, ya kaganawan kamag-anak na, nanugêl sila pun sa Egipto. Sa kinakarangan panawun, sila buy layi la, nanugêl silay na baydu buy inlumakêy nay anak la. Kabay binêg silan Israelita.

Many years later, a new Pharaoh came to power in Egypt. The Egyptians forgot about Joseph and all he had done to help them. They became afraid of the Israelites because there were so many of them. So the Egyptians made the Israelites their slaves.


Sa kinakarangan na panawun, ya mani taga Egipto, naliwan lay na si Jose buy paglingkud na sa mani taga Egipto. Nalimwan na mani taga Egiptu sa mani Israelita gawan inlumakê silayna. Kabay ati ya bayun puun, inipus nay mani Israelita.

The Egyptians forced the Israelites to build many buildings and even whole cities. The hard work made their lives miserable, but God blessed them, and they had even more children.


ya mani Egiptu, pinilit lay mani Israelita un manyag matag-ay ya bali buy makwal la balayan. Pinaubra silan masakit, nuwa pinagpala silan Bapan Namalyari buy inlumakêy nay mani anak la.

Pharaoh saw that the Israelites were having many babies, so he ordered all Israelite baby boys to be killed by throwing them into the Nile River.


Nuwa nakit  Puun Paraun ya lakwas  silay san  inlumakêy anak  mani  Israelita. Kabay in-utus na, "Nu liyaki ya anak un Israelita, isamwag ga kulaw sa ilug ta amên mati."

A certain Israelite woman gave birth to a baby boy. She and her husband hid the baby for as long as they could.


Amêsên, dilag gisay Israelitay babayi ya nanganak un gisay liyaki. Siya buy asawa na, kaylangan lan itaguy kulaw sa makarang nga panawun.

Then they put him in a floating basket in the Nile River. His older sister watched to see what would happen to him.


Kabay nanyag yan basket bayu na kinuskusan un lilin ta amên aya masunan lanêm. Pamakayari, indin nay kulaw sa basket buy gintan na êt ta basket buy inbul-is sa agid lanêm . Si patêl  kulaw ya naglagyun Miriam, naku ya êt sa ilug, ta pambantayan naya nu sabêt ta malyari kana.

A daughter of Pharaoh saw the basket and looked inside. When she saw the baby, she took him as her own son. She hired the baby’s own mother to nurse him. When the child grew up, Pharaoh’s daughter named him Moses.


Amêsên, si dalagan  Puun Paraun, inêlêw nay lalên basket. Sên nakit nay kulaw, ya dinyag na, kinwa nay kulaw. Ta pag-anak nayna. Inupan nay indu na  amên saysayên nay sarili nan kulaw. Sên dinumagul lay  kulaw, Moises ya impalagyun dalaga.

One day, when Moses had grown up, he saw an Egyptian beating an Israelite slave. Moses tried to save his fellow Israelite.


Gisay allu, bayintawuy  na  si Moises. Nakit nay gisay Israelitay ipus  ya pampasakitin  gisay taga-Egiptu. Sinawpan nay ati tagawan tanda nay kaparisu na yan Israelita.

When he thought nobody was looking, he killed the Egyptian and buried his body. But someone saw what had happened.


 Pinatin  Moises sa gisay Egiptu  buy in-ilbêng naya.  Indap  na nu  ayin nakakit kana pakan  dilag gaman  awed  nakakit kana.

When Pharaoh found out about it, he tried to kill Moses because of what he had done. Moses ran away from Egypt to the wilderness where he would be safe.


  Sên natandan  Puun Paraun ya nalyari, labay nan patin si Moises. Nuwa sen natandan  Moises ya patin  yan Puun Paraun, nagbating  ya sa Egiptu,  ta maku ya sa marayuy lugal sa kakyangan buy baydu ya manugêl.

Moses became a shepherd in the wilderness far away from Egypt. He married and had two sons.


Nagin magpastul   mani ayup Moises ya marayu sa Egiptu. Baydu winan nag-asawa buy nakaanak yan luway liyaki.

One day while Moses was taking care of his sheep, he saw a bush that was on fire. But the bush did not burn up. Moses went to take a closer look. As he approached the burning bush, the voice of God said, “Moses, take off your shoes. You are standing on holy ground.”


Gisay allu magpastul  yan tupa. Buy nakakit yan gisay kayu ya nayêpa ya magdêkêtdêkêt. Nuwa a ya maulam. Kabay dinanyan nay ati, sên narani yina, nalêngê nay tunuy  Bapan Namalyari, ya sinabi na, <<Itas  muy sapatus mu, gawan idi  ka sa Banal la Lugal.>>

God said, “I have seen the suffering of My people. I will send you to Pharaoh so that you can bring the Israelites out of their slavery in Egypt. I will give them the land of Canaan, the land I promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.”


Buy sinabin Bapan Namalyari kan Moises, “Nakit kuy kasakitan mani tawu ku. Kabay sikay maku kan Paraun. Ta sikay mamiligtas sa mani Israelitay ipus  mani taga-Egiptu. Ta idin ku kallay lugal  la impangaku ku  sa mani ninunu  yu  ya si  Abraham, Isaac, buy Jacub.”


{{:en:obs:obs-09-14.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Moses said, “What if the people ask me who sent me, what should I say?” God said, “I AM WHO I AM. Tell them, ‘I AM has sent me to you.’ This is My name forever.”


Sinabin Moises, <<Nu mamatang sila  nu  sisabêt ta namiutus kangku, sabêt ta sêpat kun sabin kalla?>> Sinabin Bapan Namalyari,  si sabin mu kallay, <Siku wi Siku ya namiutus kamu.> Abiin  na  lagyuy pamêg la kangku makanuman.>>

Moses did not want to go, so God sent Moses’ brother, Aaron, to help him. God warned Moses and Aaron that Pharaoh would be stubborn.


Asê kalabay maku si Moises. Kabay in-utus na si Aarun ya patêl nan Moises. Ta saba siyay  manawup kan Moises. Nuwa sinabin  Bapan Namalyari kan  Moises buy  kan  Aarun, ya, “Gana kaw sumuku. Mibabata kaw. Ta nakdêy ya bêkên Puun  Paraun sa Egipto.”
