One day, a lawyer came to Jesus to test him, saying, “Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?” Jesus answered, “What is written in God’s law?”

Amêsên, dilag gisay manurun kautusana na nidêng amên subukan si Jesus. Sinabi na, “Manuru, sabêt ta sêpat kun daygên amên mabiyan nakun biyay ya ayin katganan?” 
Nakitbay si Jesus kana, “Sabêt ta nakasulat sa kautusan? Sabêt ta mangabasa mu baydu?”

“Love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, strength, and mind. And love your neighbor as yourself,” the lawyer said. Jesus answered, “You are correct! Do this and you will live.”

Nakitbay ya liyaki, “Kaidwan muy Panginuun mun Bapan Namalyari un buun bêkê, buun kaladwa, buun lakas, buy buun isip. Buy sêpat tamun kaidwan na kaparisu tamun tawu kaparisun pangidu tamu sa sarili tamu.”
“Ustuy pikitbay mu,” sinabin Jesus. “Daygên muy abiin ta amên mabiyan kan biyay ya ayin katganan.”

But the lawyer wanted to prove that he was right, so he asked, “Who is my neighbor?”

Nuwa a labay manurun mipakadêng-êy ya. Kabay pinatang na si Jesus, “Nu parabaydu, sisabêt taman na kaparisu kun tawu?”

Jesus answered with a story. “There was a Jewish man who was traveling along the road from Jerusalem to Jericho.”

Bilang pikitbay kana, nagkuwentu si Jesus, “Dilag gisay tawuy papakun sa Jericu ya ubat sa Jerusalem.

“While he was traveling, he was attacked by a group of robbers. They took everything he had and beat him until he was almost dead. Then they went away.”

Kaban mamita ya, inapat yan mani tulisan. Dinugêdugê laya, inlabus buy kinwa lay gêgtan na buy inlakwanan layan paray nan nati.

“Soon after that, a Jewish priest happened to walk down that same road. When this religious leader saw the man who had been robbed and beaten, he moved to the other side of the road, ignored the man in need, and kept on going.”

Amêsên, dilag pari un mani Judiu ya nidan baydu. Sên nakitan nay liyaki ya dinugêdugê, inlisyan naya.

“Not long after that, a Levite came down the road. (Levites were a tribe of Jews who helped the priests at the Temple.) The Levite also crossed over to the other side of the road and ignored the man who had been robbed and beaten.”

Dilag êt nidan bayduy gisay liyaki ya Levitae ya ubat sa layin Levi. Buy sên inlumatêng ya baydu, nakitan nay gisay liyaki ya dinugê-dugê, nuwa inlisyan naya êt.

“The next person to walk down that road was a Samaritan. (Samaritans were the descendants of Jews and people from other nations. Samaritans and Jews hated each other.) When the Samaritan saw the man, he was filled with compassion. He cared for him and bandaged his wounds.”

Amêsên, dilag gisay tawuy taga Samariaf ya nidan baydu. Nuwa sên nakitan nay liyaki ya dinugêdugê, kinalunusan naya. Dinanyan nay abaytuy liyaki ta inuyasan nan alak buy laru ya mani nuka na bayu na binêdbêdan.

“The Samaritan then lifted the man onto his own donkey and took him to a hotel where he took care of him.”

Pamakayari, insakay nay liyaki sa saysay nay pagsakayan na buy gintan naya sa bali' ya pan-upan. Ta baydu nayan sinaysay.

“The next day, the Samaritan needed to continue his journey. He gave the person in charge of the hotel some money and said, ‘Take care of him, and if any extra money is spent, I will repay those expenses when I return.’”

Pamakawasak, binyanan nan kuwalta ya magbandin bali' ya pan-upan na bayu na sinabi kana, “Saysayên mu ya buy nu kulang pun na abiin na magastus mu kana, bayaran kata sa pag-udung ku.”

Then Jesus asked the lawyer, “Which one of the three men do you think was a neighbor to the man who was robbed and beaten?” The lawyer replied, “The one who showed mercy.” Jesus told the lawyer, “You go and do the same thing.”

Amêsên, pinatang Jesus ya manurun kautusan, sinabi na, “Sa êlêw mu, sisabêt sa tatlun ati ya pêtêg ga nangidu sa kaparisu nan tawuy dinugêdugên mani tulisan?” 
Nakitbay ya manurun kautusan, “Sa êlêw kuy ya nalunus kana.” 
Kabay sinabin Jesus kana, “Dale ka. Para êt bayduy daygên mu.”
