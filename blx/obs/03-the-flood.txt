====== 3. Ya Lanab ======

{{:en:obs:obs-03-01.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

After a long time, many people were living in the world. They had become very wicked and violent. It became so bad that God decided to destroy the whole world with a huge flood.

Pamakayarin makarang nga panawun, kaban mallumakêy mani tawu sa babun luta, lakwas silan dinumawak. Kabay sinabin Bapan Namalyari, “Siren kinay babun luta sa kapamilatan maragul la lanab.”

But Noah found favor with God. He was a righteous man, living among wicked people. God told Noah about the flood He was planning to send. He told Noah to build a huge boat.

Nuwa dilag gisay liyaki ya kapapaidu kan Bapan Namalyari. Si lagyu na, Noe gisa yay liyaki ya mapanunul kan Bapan Namalyari. Sinabin Bapan Namalyari kan Noe ya palanu nay tungkul sa maragul la lanab. Buy in-utus na kan Noe ya manyag yan gisay maragul la barku.

God told Noah to make the boat about 140 meters long, 23 meters wide, and 13.5 meters high. It was to be made of wood and have three levels, many rooms, a roof, and a window. The boat would keep Noah, his family, and every kind of land animal safe during the flood.

Sinabin Bapan Namalyari kan Noe ya sukad barkuy daygên nay dinalan buy apattapuy metru ya karang, luwampu buy tatluy metru ya lapad, buy labin tatlu buy kapitnay metru ya tag-ay. Dyag sa kayuy barkuy daygên na. Daygên nan tatluy palapag ga ati, malakêy kuwartu, gisay awang buy bubung. Miligtas sa pamilyan Noe buy ya kaganawan kalasin ayup sa kapamilatan maragul la barkun ati.

Noah obeyed God. He and his three sons built the boat just the way God had told them. It took many years to build the boat, because it was so big. Noah warned the people about the coming flood and told them to turn to God, but they did not believe him.

Dinyag yabay Noe ya in-utus Bapan Namalyari kana. Sinawpan yan tatluy anak nay lawyaki. Gawan kakaragulan barku, umnuy tawun na nilabas bayu nayari ya barku. Kaban pandaygên lay barku, sinabin Noe sa mani tawu, dilag lumatêng nga karagulan lanab. Sinabi na êt kallay dapat silan magdani kan Bapan Namalyari. Nuwa asê maniwala kanay mani tawu.

God also commanded Noah and his family to gather enough food for themselves and the animals. When everything was ready, God told Noah it was time for him, his wife, his three sons, and their wives to get into the boat—eight people in all.

In-utus êt Bapan Namalyari kallan Noe ya manipun silan malakêy kanên para kalla buy para sa mani ayup. Sên nakal-an nay kaganawan, sinabin Bapan Namalyari kan Noe, “Noe, sumun kawna buy pamilya mu sa barku.” Para yabay bayduy dinyag la. Wawalu silay sinumun sa barku.

God sent a male and a female of every animal and bird to Noah so they could go into the boat and be kept safe during the flood. God sent seven males and seven females of every type of animal which could be used for sacrifices. When they were all in the boat, God himself closed the door.

Impalakun Bapan Namalyari sa barkun Noe ya kaganawan kalasin ayup buy uybun manuk. Liyaki buy babayi ya impalaku na. Nipagtan yan pituy lawyaki buy pituy babayi ya ayup pa malyarin iandug kan Bapan Namalyari. Pituy lawyaki buy pituy babayi ya uybun manuk ya inpasun la sa barku. Sên nakasun nay kaganawan, in-saray nan Bapan Namalyari ya pasbul barku.

Then it began to rain, and rain, and rain. It rained for forty days and forty nights without stopping! Water also came gushing up out of the earth. Everything in the whole world was covered with water, even the highest mountains.

Pamakayarin anêm ma allu, nag-umpisay nan nanguran. Asê tinunggên na uran sa lalên apattapuy allu buy apattapuy yabi. Buy ya lanêm ma naubat sa luta, nallanab bana sa babun luta. Kabay ya buun babun luta inlanab bana.

{{:en:obs:obs-03-08.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

Everything that lived on the dry land died, except the people and animals that were in the boat. The boat floated on the water and everything inside the boat was kept safe.

Nangamamati ya kaganawan tawu buy ayup pa mambumyay sa luta. Ya nitagan tanay nabyay abitu silay idi sa lalên barkun Noe. Lêpawlêpaw wa barkun Noe sa lanab. Ya kaganawan nakasakay baydu niligtas sa maragul la lanab.

{{:en:obs:obs-03-09.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

After the rains stopped, the boat floated on the water for five months, and then one day the boat rested on the top of a mountain. But the world was still covered with water. After three more months, the tops of the mountains were visible.

Sên tinunggên nay uran, limay buwan pun bayu inyumupay lanab. Gisay allu, nisadsad da barkun Noe sa gisay matag-ay ya bung-uy. Nuwa matag-ay pun na lanêm sa kaatag ga lugal sa babun luta. Tatluy buwan pun na nilabas bayu nakitan lan Noe ya tung-uy mani bung-uy.

After forty more days, Noah sent out a bird called a raven to see if the water had dried up. The raven flew back and forth looking for dry land, but it could not find any.


Pamakalibas sa êt apattapuy allu. Nipalpad gisay uwak si Noe amên êlêwên nu ayin nan lanab. Niudung-udung mallupad da uwak, nuwa ayin yan nakitan na namalay luta.

{{:en:obs:obs-03-11.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

Later Noah sent out a bird called a dove. But it also could not find any dry land, so it came back to Noah. A week later he sent the dove out again, and it came back with an olive branch in its beak! The water was going down, and the plants were growing again!

Asê naepêng, nipalpad da êt gisay patipati si Noe. Nag-udung êt ta ati kan Noe gawan ayin yan nakitan na namalay luta., Nilabas sa pituy allu, inpalpad da êt Noe ya patipati. Asê naêpêng nag-udung yan nigêgtan sangan kayuy nabasa. Natula si Noe gawan binumêlêng ngay lanab buy tinumubun nanguman na mani tanaman.

{{:en:obs:obs-03-12.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

Noah waited another week and sent out the dove a third time. This time it found a place to rest and did not come back. The water was drying up!

nangêtêng nga êt gisay dumingu si Noe bayuy na êt nipalpad patipati. Asina nag-udung nga patipati. Naisip Noe ya dilag ginan naugpan. Labay sabin, marani yan mamalay lanab!

{{:en:obs:obs-03-13.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

Two months later God said to Noah, “You and your family and all the animals may leave the boat now. Have many children and grandchildren and fill the earth.” So Noah and his family left the boat.

Pamakalibas luway buwan, sinabin Bapan Namalyari kan Noe, “Malyari kaynan mag-awas sa barku. Pasalwangen mu êt ta pamilya mu buy ya kaganawan ayup. Pakapnun yun tawu buy ayup pa buun babun luta.”Nag-awas sabay sa barku si Noe buy ya pamilya na.

{{:en:obs:obs-03-14.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

After Noah got off the boat, he built an altar and sacrificed some of each kind of animal, which could be used for a sacrifice. God was happy with the sacrifice and blessed Noah and his family.

Pamakasalwang lan Noe sa barku, nanyag yan gisay altar. Namiandug yan kaganawan kalasin ayup pa malyarin iandug kan Bapan Namalyari. Natula si Bapan Namalyari sa mani in-andug Noe kabay pinagpala na si Noe buy pamilya na.

{{:en:obs:obs-03-15.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

God said, “I promise I will never again curse the ground because of humans or destroy the world with a flood, even though humans are sinful from their youth.”


Sinabin Bapan Namalyari kan Noe, “Pan-ipangaku ku kamu, akina umanên lanabên na babun luta gawan sa pandaygên mani tawu. Akina sirên na babun luta sa kapamilatan lanab agyan makasalanan pun na mani tawu.”

{{:en:obs:obs-03-16.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

God then made the first rainbow as a sign of his promise. Every time the rainbow appeared in the sky, God would remember what he promised and so would his people.

Pamakayari, nanyag buwangaw si Bapan Namalyari bilang patandá sa pangaku na. Kabay balang magpakit ta buwangaw, maganakan Bapan Namalyari buy mani tawu ya pangaku na.
