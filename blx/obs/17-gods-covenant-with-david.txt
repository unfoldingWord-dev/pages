Saul was the first king of Israel. He was tall and handsome, just like the people wanted. Saul did well at first, but he became a wicked man who did not obey God, so God chose a different man to be king in his place.

Si Saulu ya saba nunan Ari sa Israel. Matagay ya buy mangêd yan êlêwên kaparisun inyawad mani Israelita kan Bapan Namalyari. Sa nuna nan pamanangkulan, mangêd da dinyag na. Nuwa sa kinakadangan na panawun, dinumawak ka pamanangkulan na buy a nay na labay sunulên ya kalabayan Bapan Namalyari. Kabay si Bapan Namalyari, namili yan gisay liyaki ya saba isagili na kan Saulu.

This man’s name was David. He was a shepherd. While watching the sheep, David had killed both a lion and a bear which had attacked the sheep. David was also a humble and righteous man who trusted and obeyed God.

Si David ya saba kasagili nan Saulu. Kay gisa yan magpastul tupa. Nuwa bayu ya nag-ari sa Israel, parayadi ya nalyari. Kaban magpastul yan tupa, nakit nay mani matubag ga saysay ya manduyung sa tupa na. Kabay si dinyag David, pinati na sila gawan matubag ga pangaliyaki na. Nuwa si si David, nayêpay nakêm na, matinêk, buy manampalataya ya kan Bapan Namalyari.

David was also a great soldier and leader. When David was still a young man, he fought against a giant named Goliath. Goliath was a trained soldier, very strong, and almost three meters tall! But God helped David kill Goliath and save Israel.

Si David, magaling yan sundalus buy mamunu. Sên bayuntawuyna, inlabanan nay gisay iganti ya saba si Goliat. Si Goliat, magaling yan sundulas, matapang buy napas-êy, buy subran 3 metru ya tag-ay na! Nuwa sinawpan Bapan Namalyari si David un patin si Goliat ta amên sa pakapakun baydu, iligtas ya mani Israelita.

Saul became jealous of David and tried many times to kill him. One day Saul was looking for David so he could kill him. Saul went into the same cave where David was hiding. Instead of killing Saul, David cut off a piece of his clothes to prove to Saul that he would not kill him to become king.

Si Arin Saulu, kinasêman na si David buy pawa nan pansikapên na patin na ya. Gisay allu, tinkapên na ya. Sinumun si Saulu sa gisay yungib nu saantu nakatagu si David. A ya pinatin David nun a ginipas nay pêrad nan yaming Saulu. Dinyag na ati ta amên paptêgan na a na labay patin si Saulu ta amên yata mag-ari.

Eventually, Saul died in battle, and David became king of Israel. He was a good king, and the people loved him. God blessed David and made him successful. David fought many battles and God gave him victory. David conquered Jerusalem and made it his capital. During David’s reign, Israel became powerful and wealthy.

Sa kapupusan, nati si Saulu sa gisay laban. Sa pakapakun baydu si David ya nagin ari sa Israel. Mangêd yan ari buy labaylabay yan mani tawu. Pinagpala yan Bapan Namalyari buy malakêy laban na nanambut ya gawan sa sawup Bapan Namalyari kana. Sên nanakup ya êt sa balayan Jerusalem, inawyunan ya êt Bapan Namalyari buy ya balayan Jerusalem saba nagin capitulyu un Israel. Sa panawun pag-arin David, naging makapangyarian buy mabandi ya buun Israel.

David wanted to build a temple where everybody could worship God and offer Him sacrifices. For about 400 years, the people had been worshiping God and offering sacrifices to Him at the Tent of Meeting that Moses had built.

Sa lalên 400 na tawun, nangulimên buy nag-andug ya mani Israelita sa Tabirnakulu ya dinyag Moises awlagi. Amêsên, labay Arin David da mamipaydêng yan templu sa Jerusalem ta amên ya kaganawan, mangulimên buy mag-andug sila baydu.

God sent the prophet Nathan to David with this message, “Because you are a man of war, you will not build Me this house; your son will. But, I will bless you greatly. Someone from your family will always sit on the throne of Israel. And the Messiah will be one of your descendants!” The Messiah is God’s Chosen One who would save the world from sin.

Nuwa impalakun Bapan Namalyari si prupetan Natan kan David, sinabi na, <<Paradi ya pan-ipasabin Bapan Namalyari kamu. Gawan matubag ga pangaliyaku mu,, alwan sikay manyag bali ku nun a anak mina man. Nuwa paraman baydu, pagpalên katan mangêd. Buy alwa pun êt kay abiin ta si layi mu, pawa yan miknu sa trunu bilang Ari sa Israel. Buy maubat sa layi mu ya Tagapagligtas sa lumatêng!>> 

{{:en:obs:obs-17-08.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

When David heard these words, he immediately thanked and praised God because He had promised David great honor and many blessings. The Israelites would have to wait a long time before the Messiah came, almost 1,000 years.

Sên nalêngê David ya sinabin Natan, tambêng yan nagpasalamat buy nangulimên kan Bapan Namalyari gawan impangakun Bapan Namalyari ya kanay galang buy kangêdan. Nuwa ya mani Israelita, mangêtêng sila pun 1,000 tawun bayu lumatêng nga Tagapagligtas.

David ruled with justice and faithfulness for many years, and God blessed him. However, toward the end of his life he sinned terribly before God.

Mangêd ya pag-arin David. Matinêk ya buy pinagpala yan Bapan Namalyari. Nuwa sa kapupusan biyay na, nakadyag yan narawak sa pangêlêw Bapan Namalyari.

One day, when all of his soldiers were out fighting, David got up from an afternoon nap and saw a beautiful woman bathing. Her name was Bathsheba.

Gisay allu, kaban manlumaban na mani sundalus na, magmamanya manan naman namabêlêw si David sa bali na. Sên nimata ya, siyan nakit nay naidu-iduy babayi ya magpaluyu. Batseba ya lagyu na.

{{:en:obs:obs-17-11.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

Instead of looking away, David sent someone to bring her to him. He slept with her and sent her back home. A short time later Bathsheba sent a message to David saying that she was pregnant.

Nagtalibatuk ya dayi nuwa a ya nakabata nun a impakwa na ya. Ginêtan nay babayi buy pamakayari, impauli na ya. A naêpêng, imbalitan Batseba kan David da, <<Nangalêk kaku buy saba sikay bapa.>>

{{:en:obs:obs-17-12.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

Her husband, Uriah, was one of David’s best soldiers. David called Uriah back from the battle and told him to go be with his wife. But Uriah refused to go home while the rest of the soldiers were in battle. So David sent Uriah back to the battle and had him placed where the enemy was strongest so that he would be killed.

Si Urias saba asawan Batseba. Gisa yan magaling nga sundalus David. Sinagyat yan David un mita ya baydu sa laban buy muli ya. Sên inlumatêng ngina, sinabin David kana, <<Muli kayna buy gêtan mun mamawatwat ta asawa mu.>> Nuwa si Urias, a ya nalabay ta pan-isipên nay kasakitan na maranasan un kaawyunan na mani sundalus baydu sa laban. Kabay impalaku yan Arin David sa gisay laban na pinakamapas-êy ya mani kapati ta amên mati ya.

{{:en:obs:obs-17-13.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

After Uriah was killed, David married Bathsheba. Later, she gave birth to a son. God was not pleased with what David had done, so He sent the prophet Nathan to show David his sin. David repented of his sin and God forgave him. For the rest of his life, David trusted God, even in difficult times.

Sên nati yinay Urias, tinangên yan Arin David si Batseba. In-anak nay gisay kulaw. Nasuluk si Bapan Namalyari sa dinyag David. Kabay in-utus nay prupetan Natan kan David, sinabi na, <<David, nangasalanan ka kan Bapan Namalyari.>> Nagsisi si David buy pinatawadên Bapan Namalyari ya kasalanan na. Paubat baydu, nanampalataya si David kan Bapan Namalyari agyan masakit ya dinanan na.

{{:en:obs:obs-17-14.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

But as punishment for his sin, David’s baby boy died. There was also fighting in David’s family for the rest of his life, and David’s power was greatly weakened. Though David had been unfaithful to God, God was still faithful to His promises. Bathsheba gave birth to another son named Solomon.

Bilang parusa a kasalanan na, nati ya anak David buy nipapati ya mani miembru un pamilyan David anggan alwa yinan mapas-êy. In-anak Batseba ya kaatag anak liyaki ya pinaglagyu lan Sulumun.
