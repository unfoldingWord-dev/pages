{{:en:obs:obs-17-01.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

Saul was the first king of Israel. He was tall and handsome, just like the people wanted. Saul did well at first, but he became a wicked man who did not obey God, so God chose a different man to be king in his place.

Si Saulu ya saba nunan Ari sa Israel. Matagay ya buy mangêd yan êlêwên kaparisun inyawad mani Israelita kan Bapan Namalyari. Sa nuna nan pamanangkulan, mangêd da dinyag na. Nuwa sa kinakadangan na panawun, dinumawak ka pamanangkulan na buy a nay na labay sunulên ya kalabayan Bapan Namalyari. Kabay si Bapan Namalyari, namili yan gisay liyaki ya saba isagili na kan Saulu.

This man’s name was David. He was a shepherd. While watching the sheep, David had killed both a lion and a bear which had attacked the sheep. David was also a humble and righteous man who trusted and obeyed God.

Si David ya saba kasagili nan Saulu. Kay gisa yan magpastul tupa. Nuwa bayu ya nag-ari sa Israel, parayadi ya nalyari. Kaban magpastul yan tupa, nakit nay mani matubag ga saysay ya manduyung sa tupa na. Kabay si dinyag David, pinati na sila gawan matubag ga pangaliyaki na. Nuwa si si David, nayêpay nakêm na, matinêk, buy nanampalataya ya kan Bapan Namalyari.

David was also a great soldier and leader. When David was still a young man, he fought against a giant named Goliath. Goliath was a trained soldier, very strong, and almost three meters tall! But God helped David kill Goliath and save Israel.

Si David, mangêd da sundalu buy mamunu. Sên bayuntawu ya pun, linabanan nay gisay higanti ya si Goliat. Si Goliat ya magalang nga sundulas, mapas-êy, buy subran 3 meter ya tag-ay na! Nuwa sinawpan si David un Bapan Namalyari ya mamati Goliat ta amên iligtas ya mani Israelita.

Saul became jealous of David and tried many times to kill him. One day Saul was looking for David so he could kill him. Saul went into the same cave where David was hiding. Instead of killing Saul, David cut off a piece of his clothes to prove to Saul that he would not kill him to become king.

Sa Arin Saulu, nainggit ya kan David buy pawa pansikapên nay patin si David. Gisay allu, pantêkapên yan Saulu si David ta amên patin. Sinumun si Saulu sa kweba nu parasaantu si David ya nakatagu. Alwan pinati yan David nun a ginunting nay pêrad sa yaming Saulu. Dinyag na ati ta amên paptêgan na a na labay patin si Saulu ta amên magin ari.

Eventually, Saul died in battle, and David became king of Israel. He was a good king, and the people loved him. God blessed David and made him successful. David fought many battles and God gave him victory. David conquered Jerusalem and made it his capital. During David’s reign, Israel became powerful and wealthy.

Sa katatawlian, nati si Saulu sa laban buy si David ya nagin ari sa Israel. Mangêd yan ari buy panidun yan mani tawu. Pinagpalên na yan Bapan Namalyari. Malakê ya laban David buy nanambut ya gawan sa sawup Bapan Namalyari. Nanakup ya sa balayan Jerusalem buy Jerusalem ya nagin capitol Israel. Sa panawun pag-arin David, naging makapangyarian buy mabandi ya Israel.

David wanted to build a temple where everybody could worship God and offer Him sacrifices. For about 400 years, the people had been worshiping God and offering sacrifices to Him at the Tent of Meeting that Moses had built.

Sa lalên 400 tawun, nangulimên buy nag-andug ya mani Israelita sa Tabirnakulu ya dinyag Moises awlagi. Amêsên, labay Arin David da mamaydêng yan templu sa Jerusalem ta amên mangulimên buy mag-andug ga kaganawan baydu.

God sent the prophet Nathan to David with this message, “Because you are a man of war, you will not build Me this house; your son will. But, I will bless you greatly. Someone from your family will always sit on the throne of Israel. And the Messiah will be one of your descendants!” The Messiah is God’s Chosen One who would save the world from sin.

Nuwa impagtan Bapan Namalyari ya prupetan Natan kan David. Abituy sinabi na, <<Gawan sika ya liyaki un laban, alwan sikay manyag bali ku nun a anak mu. Nuwa pagpalên katan mangêd. Pawan dilag layi mu ya miknu sa trunu sa Israel. Buy layi mu ya Mesias/Tagapagligtas sa lumatêng!>> 

{{:en:obs:obs-17-08.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

When David heard these words, he immediately thanked and praised God because He had promised David great honor and many blessings. The Israelites would have to wait a long time before the Messiah came, almost 1,000 years.

Sên nalêngê David ya sinabin Natan, tambêng yan nagpasalamat buy nangulimên kan Bapan Namalyari gawan impangakun Bapan Namalyari kanay galang buy kangêdan. Nuwa ya mani Israelita, mangêtêng silan 1000 tawun bayu lumatêng ya Tagapagligtas.

David ruled with justice and faithfulness for many years, and God blessed him. However, toward the end of his life he sinned terribly before God.

Mangêd ya pag-arin David. Matinêk ya buy pinagpalên yan Bapan Namalyari. Nuwa sa kapupusan biyay na, nanyag yan madawak sa pangêlêw Bapan Namalyari.

One day, when all of his soldiers were out fighting, David got up from an afternoon nap and saw a beautiful woman bathing. Her name was Bathsheba.

Gisay allu, kaban manlumaban na mani sundalus na, nimata si David sa kaawat buy nakit nay maidu ya babayi na nanliyu. Batseba ya lagyu na.

{{:en:obs:obs-17-11.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

Instead of looking away, David sent someone to bring her to him. He slept with her and sent her back home. A short time later Bathsheba sent a message to David saying that she was pregnant.

Inêlêw na dayi sa kaatag nuwa impakwa na ya. Tinakês na ya buy pinauli. A naêpêng, imbalitan Batseba kan David da nangalêk ya.

{{:en:obs:obs-17-12.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

Her husband, Uriah, was one of David’s best soldiers. David called Uriah back from the battle and told him to go be with his wife. But Uriah refused to go home while the rest of the soldiers were in battle. So David sent Uriah back to the battle and had him placed where the enemy was strongest so that he would be killed.

Si Urias sa asawan Batseba ya gisa sa mani mangêd da sundalus David. Sinagyat yan David da mita sa laban buy muli. Sinabi na kana, <<Muli kayna buy magyabi sa asawa mu.>> Nuwa si Urias, a na labay ta pan-isipên nay kasakitan un mani kaawyun na sundalus baydu sa laban. Kabay impagtan yan Arin David sa laban sa lugal la pinakamapas-êy ya mani kapati ta amên mati ya.

{{:en:obs:obs-17-13.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

After Uriah was killed, David married Bathsheba. Later, she gave birth to a son. God was not pleased with what David had done, so He sent the prophet Nathan to show David his sin. David repented of his sin and God forgave him. For the rest of his life, David trusted God, even in difficult times.

Sên nati yinay Urias, tinangên yan Arin David si Batseba. In-anak nay gisay kulaw. Nasuluk si Bapan Namalyari sa dinyag David. Kabay in-utus nay prupetan Natan kan David, sinabi na, <<David, nangasalanan ka kan Bapan Namalyari.>> Nagsisi si David buy pinatawadên Bapan Namalyari ya kasalanan na. Paubat baydu, nanampalataya si David kan Bapan Namalyari agyan masakit ya dinanan na.

{{:en:obs:obs-17-14.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

But as punishment for his sin, David’s baby boy died. There was also fighting in David’s family for the rest of his life, and David’s power was greatly weakened. Though David had been unfaithful to God, God was still faithful to His promises. Bathsheba gave birth to another son named Solomon.

Bilang parusa a kasalanan na, nati ya anak David buy nipapati ya mani miembru un pamilyan David anggan alwa yinan mapas-êy. In-anak Batseba ya kaatag anak liyaki ya pinaglagyu lan Sulumun.
