As the boys grew up, Rebekah loved Jacob, but Isaac loved Esau. Jacob loved to stay at home, but Esau loved to hunt.


Amêsên, dinumagul  lay  kambal. Si Isaac, kakaidwan nay panganay. Buy si Rebekah, kakaidwan nay  naman et ta  ali. Si  Esau, mangabung ya. Nuwa si Jacob, mangumpuni yan bali.

One day, when Esau came back from hunting, he was very hungry. Esau said to Jacob, “Please give me some of the food you have made.” Jacob responded, “First, give me your rights as the oldest son.” So Esau gave Jacob his rights as the oldest son. Then Jacob gave him some food.

When Isaac was old, he wanted to give his blessing to Esau. But before he did, Rebekah and Jacob tricked him by having Jacob pretend to be Esau. Jacob put on Esau’s clothes and put goat skins on his neck and hands.


Sên tuway na si  Isaac, labay nay nan itiwala sa panganay ya kangêran ya indin  Bapan Namalyari kana. Sen natandan  Rebekah ya  itiwalan Isaac sa panganay ya kangedan Bapan Namalyari. Kabay pinaras nan bineg ga ali  amên mapurayit la  si Isaac sa kapêtêgan. Ta labay nan Rebekah kay ali ya pitiwalan nan Isaac  un kangedana na.


Isaac could not see well. Jacob came to Isaac and said, “I am Esau, I have come to receive your blessing.” When Isaac felt the goat hair and smelled the clothes, he thought it was Esau and blessed him.

Esau hated Jacob because Jacob stole his rights as oldest son and also his blessing. So he planned to kill Jacob after their father died.

But Rebekah heard of Esau’s plan. So she arranged for Jacob to be sent far away to live with her relatives.


Nuwa sên natandan  Rebekah buy  si Isaac ya inisip panganay, sinabi nan Rebekah sa ali, “Parasen   muy anak ku un maku  sa mani kamag-anak ku. Ta labay  kan patin un kaka mu”, sinabin Rebekah.

While Jacob was there, he married four women who gave birth to a total of twelve sons and a daughter. God made him very wealthy.

After twenty years away from his home in Canaan, Jacob returned there with his family, his servants, and all his herds of animals.


Sen dilag ginan luwampu ya tawun baydu sa lugal  kamag-anak nan Rebekah, nuli silay na sa Canaan ya lugal la inpangakun  Bapan Namalyari, kaawyun nay  pamilya na, mani ipus buy mani ayup na.

He was very afraid because he thought Esau still wanted to kill him. So he sent Esau many herds of animals as a gift. The servants who brought the animals said to Esau, “These animals are a gift from your servant, Jacob. He is coming soon.”


Kaban idi  sila sa dan, malimu si Jacob. Ta naganaka nay sinabin  kaka na ya patin na ya. Buy ya dinyag na, namipauna  yan malakêy kambing buy  tupa. Dinalan buy luwampu ya bilang un kambing. Para et baydu  ya  bilang  tupa. Ta ati ya ilangad na sa  kaka na.

But Esau had already forgiven Jacob, and they were happily reunited. Jacob then lived peacefully in Canaan. Then Isaac died, and Jacob and Esau buried him. The covenant promises God had promised to Abraham and then to Isaac now passed on to Jacob.


Nuwa, si kaka na, mana nay nan  pinatawad da ali na. Buy sen nilatêng sila, matula silan niaawyun. Buy si Jacob, dilag ginan kapatêtbêkan na manugêl lina sa lugal la inpangakun  Bapan Namalyari kalla.
