As the boys grew up, Rebekah loved Jacob, but Isaac loved Esau. Jacob loved to stay at home, but Esau loved to hunt.

Amêsên, dinumagul silay kambal. Si Isaac, kakaidwan nay panganay. Buy si Rebekah êt, kakaidwan nay bunsu. Si Esau, mangabung ya. Nuwa si Jacob, mangumpuni yan bali.

One day, when Esau came back from hunting, he was very hungry. Esau said to Jacob, “Please give me some of the food you have made.” Jacob responded, “First, give me your rights as the oldest son.” So Esau gave Jacob his rights as the oldest son. Then Jacob gave him some food.

When Isaac was old, he wanted to give his blessing to Esau. But before he did, Rebekah and Jacob tricked him by having Jacob pretend to be Esau. Jacob put on Esau’s clothes and put goat skins on his neck and hands.

Sên matuwa yinay Isaac, labay nan itiwala sa panganay ya kangêran ya indin nan Bapan Namalyari kana. Nuwa sa natandan nan Rebekah ya si panganay ya pagtiwalan nan Isaac un kangêran na, kabay pinaras na yan binêg amên mapurayit la ya si Isaac sa kapêtêgan. Ta labay nan Rebekah kay si bunsu ya pagtiwalan un kangêran nan Isaac.

Isaac could not see well. Jacob came to Isaac and said, “I am Esau, I have come to receive your blessing.” When Isaac felt the goat hair and smelled the clothes, he thought it was Esau and blessed him.

Esau hated Jacob because Jacob stole his rights as oldest son and also his blessing. So he planned to kill Jacob after their father died.

Sên natandan nan Esau ya pinurayit la yan mita-indu, nanubag yan sadya. Buy ya inisip nan Esau, “Nu mati yinay bapa tamu, patin ku si ali ku.”

But Rebekah heard of Esau’s plan. So she arranged for Jacob to be sent far away to live with her relatives.

Nuwa sên natandan nan Rebekah buy Isaac ya isip nan panganay, sinabi nan Rebekah sa bunsu, “Anak ku, parasun mun maku sa mani kamag-anak ku. Ta labay na kan patin un kaka mu”, sinabin Rebekah.

While Jacob was there, he married four women who gave birth to a total of twelve sons and a daughter. God made him very wealthy.

Sên anti yinay Jacob baydu sa lugal un kamag-anak nan indu na, nakaanak yan labinluway liyaki buy gisay babayi. Buy binumandi yan sadya baydu.

After twenty years away from his home in Canaan, Jacob returned there with his family, his servants, and all his herds of animals.

Sa dilag yina luwampu ya tawun baydu sa lugal lan kamag-anak nan Rebekah, nuli silay na sa Canaan ya lugal la inpangaku nan Bapan Namalyari, kaawyun na silay mani pamilya na, mani ipus buy mani ayup na.

He was very afraid because he thought Esau still wanted to kill him. So he sent Esau many herds of animals as a gift. The servants who brought the animals said to Esau, “These animals are a gift from your servant, Jacob. He is coming soon.”

Sên anti sila sa dan, malimu ya. Ta ganakan na ya sinabi nan kaka na ya patin na ya. Buy ya dinyag na, nagpauna yan malakê ya kambing buy malakê ya tupa. Dinalan buy luwampu ya bilang un kambing. Parabaydu êt ya bilang un tupa. Ta ati ya imulta na kan kaka na.

But Esau had already forgiven Jacob, and they were happily reunited. Jacob then lived peacefully in Canaan. Then Isaac died, and Jacob and Esau buried him. The covenant promises God had promised to Abraham and then to Isaac now passed on to Jacob.

Nuwa, si kaka na, mana na yina pinatawad ya ali na. Buy sa nilatêng sila, matula silan naytipuntipun. Buy si Jacob, dilag yinan kapatêtbêkan ya manugêl yina sa lugal ya inpangaku nan Bapan Namalyari kalla.
