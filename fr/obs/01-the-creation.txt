====== 1. La Création ======

C'est ainsi que le debut de toute chose arriva. Dieu créa l'univers et tout ce qu'il contient en six jours. Au début, la Terre était sombre et vide,et rien n'avait été créeé . Mais l'Esprit de Dieu se tenait là au-dessus de l'eau.


{{:en:obs:obs-01-02.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Puis Dieu parla et dit, "Qu'il y ait de la lumière!" et la lumière fut. Dieu vit que la lumière était bonne et Il l'appela "jour". Il la sépara des ténébres, qu'Il appela "nuit". Dieu créa la lumière le premier jour de la création.

Le second jour de la création, Dieu parla et créa le ciel au-dessus de la Terre.

On the third day, God spoke and separated the water from the dry land. He called the dry land "earth," and He called the water "seas."


{{:en:obs:obs-01-05.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Then God said, "Let the earth produce all kinds of trees and plants." And that is what happened. God saw that what He had created was good, and He was pleased with it all.

On the fourth day of creation, God spoke and made the sun, the moon, and the stars. God made them to give light to the earth and to mark day and night, seasons and years.

On the fifth day, God created everything that swims in the water and all the birds. God saw that it was good, and He blessed them.

On the sixth day of creation, God said, "Let there be all kinds of land animals!" And it happened just like God said. Some were farm animals, some crawled on the ground, and some were wild. And God saw that it was good.


{{:en:obs:obs-01-09.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Then God said, "Let us make human beings in our image to be like us. They will have authority over the earth and all the animals."


{{:en:obs:obs-01-10.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


So God took some dirt, formed it into a man, and breathed life into him. This man's name was Adam. God planted a garden where Adam could live, and put him there to care for it.

In the middle of the garden, God planted two special trees—the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. God told Adam that he could eat from any tree in the garden except from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. If he ate from this tree, he would die.

Then God said, "It is not good for man to be alone." But none of the animals could be Adam's helper.


{{:en:obs:obs-01-13.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


So God made Adam fall into a deep sleep. Then God took one of Adam's ribs and made it into a woman and brought her to him.


{{:en:obs:obs-01-14.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


When Adam saw her, he said, "At last! This one is like me! Let her be called 'Woman,' for she was made from Man." This is why a man leaves his father and mother and becomes one with his wife.


{{:en:obs:obs-01-15.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


God made man and woman in His own image, and He saw that it was very good. He blessed them and told them, "Have many children and grandchildren and fill the earth!" This all happened on the sixth day of creation.


{{:en:obs:obs-01-16.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


When the seventh day came, God had already finished His work. So God rested from all He had been doing. He blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on this day He rested from His work. This is how God created the universe and everything in it.
