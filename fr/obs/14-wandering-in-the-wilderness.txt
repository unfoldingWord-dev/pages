After the Israelites received God’s Covenant at Mount Sinai, God began leading them toward the Promised Land, which was also called Canaan. The cloud pillar showed them the way.
Une fois que les Israelites ont reçu l'alliance de Dieu au Mont Sinai, Dieu commença a les diriger vers le pays promis.

God had promised Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob that he would give the Promised Land to their descendants, but now there were many people groups living there. They were called Canaanites. The Canaanites did not believe in God. They worshiped false gods and did many evil things.
Dieu a promis a Abraham, Isaac, et Jacob qu'il donnerait le pays promis a leurs descendants, mais maintenant il y avait beaucoup de groupes de personnes qui habitaient dans le pays. Ils s'appelaient les Canaanites.  Les Canaanites ne croyaient pas en Dieu.  Ils adoraient les faux dieux and faisaient beaucoup de mauvaises choses.

God told the Israelites, “You must get rid of all the Canaanites in the Promised Land. Do not make peace with them and do not marry them. You must completely destroy all of their idols. If you do not obey me, you will worship their idols instead of me.”
Dieu a dit aux Israelites, "Il faut que vous vous débarrassiez de tous les Canaanites dans le pays promis. Ne faites pas la paix avec eux et n'entrez pas en mariage avec eux. Vous devez détruire tous les Canaanites au pays promis. 
Si vous ne m'obéissez pas, vous allez adorer leurs idols a ma place.

When the Israelites reached the edge of Canaan, Moses chose twelve men, one from each tribe of Israel. He gave the men instructions to go and spy on the land to see what it was like. They were also to spy on the Canaanites to see if they were strong or weak.
Quand les Israelites atteignent la frontière du pays de Canaan, Moise choisit douze hommes, un de chaque tribu d'Israel.  Il donna des instructions aux hommes d'aller et d'épier le pays pour voir comment le pays était.  Ils devaient aussi épier les Canaanites pour voir si Ils étaient forts ou faibles.

The twelve men spied on Canaan for forty days and then they came back. Ten of the spies gave a bad report, saying, “The land is very good, and the crops are great! But the cities are very strong, and the people are giants! If we attack them, we will surely die!”
Les douze hommes ont epie le pays Canaan pendant 40 jours et apres sont revenus. Dix des espions ont donne un mauvais rapport et disant, "la terre est bonne, et les récoltes sont grandes! Mais les villes sont très fortes, et les gens sont géants! Si nous les attaquent, nous mourrions certainement!"

Immediately Caleb and Joshua, the other two spies, said, “It is true that the people of Canaan are tall and strong, but we can certainly defeat them! God will fight for us!”
Immediatement, Caleb et Joshua, les deux autres espions, disent, "C'est vrai que les gens du pays de Canaan sont grands et forts, mais nous pouvons certainement les vaincre! Dieu combattra pour nous!"

But the people were mad at Moses and Aaron and said, “Oh, why did you bring us to this horrible place? We should have stayed in Egypt rather than be killed in battle and our wives and children made slaves.” The people wanted to kill them and choose a new leader to bring them back to Egypt.
Mais le peuple était fache avec Moses et Aaron et dit,"Oh, pourquoi vous nous avez enmene dans cet endroit horrible? Nous aurions du rester en Egypte au lieu d'être tue en bataille et nos femmes et nos enfants rendus en esclavage." Les gens voulaient les tuer et choisir un nouveau leader pour les ramener en Egypte.

God was very angry, and his presence appeared at the Tent of Meeting. God said, “Except for Joshua and Caleb, all of the people who are twenty years old or older will wander in the wilderness until they die. They will never enter the Promised Land.”

{{:en:obs:obs-14-09.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

When the people heard this, they were sorry they had sinned. They took their weapons and went to attack Canaan. Moses warned them not to go because God was not with them, but they did not listen to him.

God did not go with them into this battle, so they were defeated and many of them were killed. Then the Israelites turned back from Canaan and wandered through the wilderness for forty years.

During that time of wandering, God provided for them. He gave them bread from heaven, called “manna.” He also sent quail (which is a kind of bird) into their camp so they could have meat to eat. During those forty years, God kept their clothes and shoes from wearing out.

God even miraculously gave them water from a rock. But despite all this, the people of Israel complained and grumbled against God and against Moses. God was still faithful to his promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

{{:en:obs:obs-14-13.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

One time, the people had no water. God told Moses, “Speak to the rock, and water will come out of it.” But Moses dishonored God in front of all the people by hitting the rock twice with a stick instead of speaking to it. Water came out of the rock for everyone to drink, but God was angry with Moses and said, “You will not enter the Promised Land.”

After the Israelites had wandered in the wilderness for forty years, all the people who had rebelled against God were dead. Then God led the people to the edge of the Promised Land again. Moses was now very old, so he chose Joshua to help him lead the people. God promised Moses that one day he would raise up another prophet like Moses.

{{:en:obs:obs-14-15.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

God brought Moses to the top of a mountain so he could see the Promised Land. Moses saw the Promised Land but never entered it. Then Moses died, and the Israelites mourned for thirty days. Joshua became their new leader. Joshua was a good leader because he trusted and obeyed God.
