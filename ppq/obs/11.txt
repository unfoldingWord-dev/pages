God warned Pharaoh that if he did not let the Israelites go, then He would kill all the firstborn males of both people and animals. When Pharaoh heard this he still refused to believe God.

The Israelites did everything just as God had commanded them. That night the angel of God went throughout Egypt killing every firstborn son.

But the Egyptians did not believe God or obey His commands. So the angel of God did not pass over their houses. The angel of God killed every firstborn son in Egypt.

From the firstborn of the prisoner in jail, to the firstborn of Pharaoh, every firstborn died. There was much weeping in Egypt.

Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron and said, “Take the Israelites and leave Egypt immediately!” The Egyptians encouraged the Israelites to leave right away.
