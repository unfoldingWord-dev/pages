====== 15. The Promised Land ======

At last it was time for the Israelites to enter the Promised Land. Joshua sent two spies to the Canaanite city of Jericho. It was protected by strong walls. A prostitute named Rahab protected the spies and helped them escape because she believed God. They promised to protect Rahab and her family when Jericho was destroyed.

To enter into the Promised Land, the Israelites had to cross the Jordan River. God told Joshua, “Have the priests go first.” When the priests’ feet touched the Jordan River, the water stopped flowing so the Israelites could cross over on dry ground.

After the people crossed the Jordan River, God told Joshua how to attack the powerful city of Jericho. The people obeyed God. The soldiers and priests marched around the city of Jericho once a day for six days.

On the seventh day, they marched around the city seven times. On the last time around the city, the soldiers shouted while the priests blew on their trumpets.

And the walls around the city fell down! The Israelites destroyed everything in the city as God had commanded. Only Rahab and her family were saved. They became part of the Israelites. When the rest of the Canaanites heard about what had happened to Jericho they were terrified.

The Canaanite tribe of Gibeon lied to Joshua and said they were from far away. They asked Joshua to make peace with them. God had commanded the Israelites not to make peace with any Canaanites, but Joshua and the Israelites did not ask God where the Gibeonites were from. So Joshua made peace with them.

When the other Canaanites heard that the Gibeonites had made peace with the Israelites, they joined their armies and attacked Gibeon. The Gibeonites sent a message to Joshua asking for help.

Joshua was angry that he had been tricked, but he gathered the Israelite army, and they marched all night to reach the Gibeonites. In the early morning they surprised their Canaanite enemies and attacked them.

God threw the Canaanites into confusion. God fought for Israel that day by sending large hailstones that killed many of the Canaanites.

God also made the sun stand still in the sky so that Israel could finish defeating the Canaanites. God won a great victory for Israel that day.

After this defeat, the rest of the Canaanites who were left gathered together to attack Israel. Joshua and the Israelites attacked and destroyed them.

After this battle, God gave each tribe of Israel their own section of the Promised Land. Then God gave Israel peace along all its borders.

When Joshua was an old man, he called all the people of Israel together. Then Joshua renewed the covenant that God had made with the Israelites at Sinai. The people promised to remain faithful to God and follow his laws.
