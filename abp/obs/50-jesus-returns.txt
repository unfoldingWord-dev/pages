{{:en:obs:obs-50-01.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

For almost 2,000 years, the Good News of Jesus the Messiah has been spreading, and the Church has been growing. Jesus said he would return at the end of the world, but he still has not come back.

Ha nalabah a loway libo a taon, ampitayak ye Manged a Balita tongkol kanan Apo Jesus a hiyay Mangiligtah. Ket alomabong hilay tataon ampamteg kanan Apo Jesus. Hinabi nan Apo Jesus a mag-odong ya ha kapopohan nin babe lota, noba ahe ya po nag-odong.

As we wait for Jesus’ return, Christians are to live holy and godly lives. When Jesus was on earth he also said, “This Good News of the Kingdom will be preached in the whole world for a testimony to all the people groups, and then the end will come.”

Ha ang-agaden tawoy pag-odong nan Apo Jesus, katapolan a magbi-ay kitawon manged boy matoynong. Ha anti ya po ha babe lota ye Apo Jesus, hinabi na, “Maiadal lano ye Manged a Balita tongkol ha panakop nan Apo Dioh ha kaganaan a lalahi boy lologal ihti ha babe lota. Pangayadi yatew, kapopohan ana nin babe lota.”

Many people groups still have not heard about Jesus. Before he returned to heaven, Jesus gave Christians the job of bringing the Good News to those who have never heard. He said, “Go and make disciples of all people groups! The fields are ripe for harvest!”

Malabong po hilay tatao a ahe po nange ye tongkol kanan Apo Jesus. Bayo ya nag-odong ha langit, imbilin nan Apo Jesus kanlan ampamteg kana a ibalita ye Manged a Balita ha kaganaan a tatao a ahe po nakange. Hinabi na, “Lakwen yoy kaganaan a lologal. Ta dyagen yo hilan mānombong ko ye tatao ha kaganaan a lologal ha babe lota.”

Jesus also said, “A servant is not greater than his master. You will be tortured and killed because of me. In this world you will have trouble, but be encouraged. I have defeated Satan! Remain faithful to the end, and you will be saved.”


Hinabi na po nin Apo Jesus, "Homain ipoh a omigit ha amo na ta hiyay intobol, ahe ya inomiigit ha nangitobol kana. Oli ha panombong yo kangko, pag-inakitan la kawon kaganaan a tatao. Dakpen la kawo lano omon paidapan boy patyen.  Paidapan la kawo nin tataon ahe ampamteg kanan Apo Dioh. Noba pak-hawen yoy nakem yo ta hinambot koynay kalok-an a anti ihti ha babe lota. Noba hinyaman a makapagteeh anggan kapopohan ket maligtah."

Jesus told his disciples a story which helped explain what the end would be like. “The Kingdom of God is like a man who planted good seed in his field. But while he was sleeping, his enemy came and planted weeds along with the wheat, and then he went away.”

Hinabi nan Apo Jesus, a wana, “Hiyay panakop nan Apo Dioh, mailalayi ya kanan maghay lākin nanabwag nin manged a bini ha pananamanan na. Noba ha padeglem legan angkatoloy hilay tatao, linomateng yay kaaway na ket hinabwagan na met nin pinahi' nin ilamon ye pananamanan na haka na linakwanan." (Mat 13:24-25)

{{:en:obs:obs-50-06.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

“When the plants sprouted, the workers asked their master, ‘Sir, you planted good seed in that field. Why are there weeds in it?’ The master answered, ‘An enemy has planted them.’”

Ha tinomobo boy manawa yayna ye bini, ket linomtaw met ye iilamon. Kaya-bay nakew hilay iipoh kanan amo la. Ket magha kanla ye nanepet, a wana, ‘Apo, main linomtaw a iilamon ha nanamanan mo. Aliwa nayi manged ye inhabwag mon bini'? Way-ihtew ibat ye iilamon?’ 

Nakibat yay amo kana a, ‘Ah! Dapat nan kaawayko yati.’ ” (Mat 13:26-28a)

{{:en:obs:obs-50-07.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

“They responded, ‘Should we pull out the weeds?’ The master said, ‘If you do that, you will pull out some of the wheat as well. Wait until the harvest and then gather the weeds into piles to be burned, but bring the wheat into my barn.’”

“Ket haanin, nanepet hilay iipoh kana, a wanla, ‘Labay mo nayi, Apo, a oloten mi hilaynay ilamon a maloke?’ 
‘Adey, tano oloten yo hilay ilamon a maloke, maolot yo hila met ye intanem ko. Paolayan yo hilaynan maihale angga ha pamopol. Ta kananyatew a panaon, habiyen ko kanan mamopol, a, “Oloten yo po mona ye ilamon ta i-olam yo hila. Pangayadi, popolen yoyna met ye paday ta ikonin yo ha kamalig ko.” ’ ” (Mat 13:28b-30)

{{:en:obs:obs-50-08.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

The disciples did not understand and said to Jesus, “Please explain this story to us.” Jesus said, “The man who planted the good seed is the Messiah. The field is the world. The good seed represents the people of God’s Kingdom.”

Ket hinomaley hilay hilay mānombong na kana ta hinabi la a, “Apo, habiyen mo man kammi no hinyay katalohan nin alimbawa mo tongkol ha mangadiwin iilamon.” 
Nakibat yay Apo Jesus, a wana, “Hiyay nanabwag nin manged a bini', ket homain kanayon no aliwan hikon ibat ha langit a in-Anak nin Tao. Hiyay pananamanan, ket tatao ihti ha babe lota. Hiyay manged a bini', ket hilay tataon anhakopen nan Apo Dioh. (Mat 13:36b-38)

{{:en:obs:obs-50-09.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

“The weeds represent the people who belong to the evil one. The enemy who planted them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the world, and the harvesters are the angels.”

Ket hiyay ilamon, hilay tataon hakop nan Satanas. Ket hiyay kaaway a nangihabwag nin ilamon, ket hiyay Satanas met a teed. Hiyay labay habiyen nin pamopol, ket kapopohan nin babe lota. Hilay māmopol, ket hilay pānobolen nin Dioh. (Mat 13:38b-39)

{{:en:obs:obs-50-10.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

“At the end of the world, all the people who belong to the devil will be gathered together and thrown into a fiery furnace, where there is weeping and grinding of teeth. Then the righteous ones will shine like the sun in the Kingdom of their Father.”

No way-omen lan inolot ye iilamon, ket wanabay met ateed lano ye malyadi ha kapopohan nin babe lota. Ket hikon ibat ha langit a in-Anak nin Tao, mangitobol akon pānobolen ko ta alihen la ha panakop ko ye kaganaan a ampakadyag nin kalok-an a nangibatan nin pagkahalanan nin kanayon. Maitapon hila ha manliyab-liyab a apoy. Ket, ihtew hilaynan tomangih boy mangiinaet. Noba hilay tataon matoynong, ket ba-mo hilan tinlag nin mangaamot ihtew ha panakopan nan Bapa la a Dioh. Hikawon ampanlenge, pakaihipen yon manged yati.” (Mat 13:40-43)

When Jesus returned to heaven, he said that he would return to earth the same way that he left—with a physical body in the clouds. Jesus also promised that when he returns, all Christians who have died will rise from the dead and meet him in the air.

{{:en:obs:obs-50-12.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

The Christians who are still alive will then be caught up together with them in the air and all Christians will be with Jesus forever. Jesus will be with his people in perfect unity forever.

{{:en:obs:obs-50-13.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

Christians will be given the crown of life. They will never experience the second death, which is hell. Instead, they will live forever with God in perfect peace.

{{:en:obs:obs-50-14.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

But those who do not believe in Jesus will be judged by God and thrown into hell forever. In hell, people constantly weep and grind their teeth in anguish. They are burned by fire that never goes out and eaten by worms that never die.

{{:en:obs:obs-50-15.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

Jesus will also completely destroy Satan and his kingdom and will throw him into the lake of fire where he will burn forever. Death also will be thrown into the lake of fire in hell.

Damaen na yan Apo Jesus ye Satanas. Itapon na ya ha apoy ket maolam yan homain anggaan. Kananyatew, homain anan kamateyan.

{{:en:obs:obs-50-16.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

Jesus will create a New Heaven and a New Earth. The universe will once again be perfect, as it was before Adam and Eve sinned.

Hiyay Apo Jesus, diyagen nay bayon langit boy bayon babe lota. Kaganaan a babagay ket mag-ilyadin genap a omon ha kahahaad bayo nagkahalanan yay Adan boy Eva.

{{:en:obs:obs-50-17.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

And Jesus will reign forever and ever. He will wipe away every tear and there will be no more death, suffering, sadness, crying, evil, or pain. He will rule his Kingdom with peace and justice, and he will be with his people forever.
