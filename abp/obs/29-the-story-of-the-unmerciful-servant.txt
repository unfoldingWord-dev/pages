One day Peter said to Jesus, “Lord, how many times should I forgive my brother when he sins against me? Up to seven times?” Jesus said, “Not seven times, but seventy times seven!” By this, Jesus meant that we should always forgive. Jesus told this story.

Haanin, hinomaley yay Pedro kanan Apo Jesus, ta nanepet ya, a wana, “Apo, mikano koya nayi patawaden ye katongno kon maheheg a ampagkahalanan kangko? Mikapito nayi a okdo?” 
Nakibat yay Apo Jesus kanan Pedro, a wana, “Aliwan bengat mikapito, no aliwan mikapitompo boy piton okdo. (Matt 18:21-22)

“The Kingdom of God is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants. One of his servants owed a huge debt worth 200,000 years’ wages.”

Ta hiyay panakopan nan Apo Dioh, ket mailalayi ya kananyatin panongtongen. Main maghay poon, a namadakit kanlan iipoh na, ta hingilen na hilayna ha ootang la. Ha ikana nayna ye māningil, in-adap la yayna kana ye maghay ipoh a nakaotang nin mapo a libo.  (Matt 18:23-24)

“Since the servant could not repay the debt, the king said, ‘Sell this man and his family as slaves to make payment on his debt.’”

Oli ha ahe ya makabayad, hinabi nan poon a, ‘Ilako yo hilayna bilang ipoh a mitapamilya boy kaganaan a babandi la omon ya makabayad ha inotang na.’ ” (Matt 18:25)

“The servant fell on his knees before the king and said, ‘Please be patient with me, and I will pay everything back.’ The king felt pity for the servant and canceled all of his debt.”

“Noba hiyay ipoh, nanalimokod yan ampakiiingalo kanan poon, a wana, ‘Apo, pangingalo mo. Mangagad ka po dayi nin makandin panaon omon ako makabayad ha kaganaan a otang ko.’ Haanin, hiyay poon, ket kinalonohan na ya. Kaya-bay ahe nayna pinabayadan ye otang na, ket pinaoli na yayna.” (Matt 18:26-27)

“The servant went out and found another servant who owed him a debt worth four months’ wages. The servant choked the man and said, ‘Pay me what you owe me!’”

“Noba ha ampoli yaynay ipoh, nahagana na ya met ye maghay ipoh a napaotangan na nin makandin alaga. Ket hiyay dinyag na kana, dinakep na yan binikke boy hinabi na kana, a wana, ‘Bayadan moynay otang mo kangko!’ ” (Matt 18:28)

“The man fell on his knees and said, ‘Please be patient with me, and I will pay everything back.’ But the servant refused and threw the man in prison until he could pay the debt.”

“Haanin, nanalimokod yan nakiiingalo kana ye kapadiho nan ipoh, a wana, ‘Pangingalo mo. Mangagad ka po dayi nin makandin panaon omon ako makabayad ha kaganaan a otang ko kammo.’ Noba ahe naya kinalonohan, no aliwan impapidiho naya anggan ahe ya makabayad ha inotang na.” (Matt 18:29-30)

“Some other servants saw what had happened and were greatly disturbed. They went to the king and told him everything.”

“Haanin, hilay kanayon a iipoh a nakakit nin nalyadi, nalele hila. Kaya-bay nakew hila kanan poon, ta inhombong la ya.” (Matt 18:31)

“The king called the servant and said, ‘You wicked servant! I forgave your debt because you begged me. You should have done the same.’ In his anger the king threw the wicked servant into prison until he paid back all of his debt.”

“Haanin, hiyay ipoh, impadakit na yan poon, ta hinabi na kana a, ‘Maloke kan tobat a ipoh! Ta ahe mo ya kinalonohan ye kapadiho mon ipoh a omon ha panlonoh ko kammo ha nakiiingalo ka kangko.’ Oli ha tobat a poot nan poon, ket impapidiho na ya angga ha mabayadan nan kaganaan ye otang na.” (Matt 18:32-34)

Then Jesus said, “This is what my heavenly Father will do to every one of you if you do not forgive your brother from your heart.”

Haanin, hinabi nan Apo Jesus, a wana, “Wanabay met ateed ye diyagen na kanyon Bapa a Dioh ha langit, no ahe kawon loboh a mamatawad nin kapadiho yo.” (Matt 18:35)
