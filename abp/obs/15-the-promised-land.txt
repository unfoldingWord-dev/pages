{{:en:obs:obs-15-01.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


At last it was time for the Israelites to enter the Promised Land. Joshua sent two spies to the Canaanite city of Jericho. It was protected by strong walls. A prostitute named Rahab protected the spies and helped them escape because she believed God. They promised to protect Rahab and her family when Jericho was destroyed.

Haanin, yatiyna ye panahon a looban lan Israelita ye logal a impangako nan Apo Dioh kanla. Kaya-bay hiyay Josue, namili yan loway lalaki boy hinabi na kanla, «Doyongen yoy banwan Jerico omon kawo maniem no mak-haw hilay kalaban tawo o ahe.»  Panlomateng la ihtew, nahagana la yay Rahab a babayin babayadan ha hatew. Noba haanin, namteg yayna kanan Apo Dioh. Kaya-bay,  hinaglapan na hilay lowan ihpiya omon la hila ahe makit nin hohondaloh ihtew.  Ket nagpangako hila met kana, «No lomoob kayiyna, adi ka angkalimo, ta homain mapano kanyon mipapamilya.”


BT - Now, this now is the time that the Israelitas will-enter the place that God promised to-them. So Josue, he chose two men and he said to-them, <<(You-PL) stealthily-approach the town of Jerico that you(PL) will-observe if our(incl) enemies are strong or not.>> When- they- arrived there, they met Rahab who was a woman to-be-paid-for (euphemism for prostitute) in time-past. But now, she believed already in Apo God. So she helped the two spies that they will- not -be-seen by the soldiers there. And they also promised to-her, <<If we(excl) will-enter already, don't you be-afraid, for nothing will-happen to-your(PL) family-members.>>

To enter into the Promised Land, the Israelites had to cross the Jordan River. God told Joshua, “Have the priests go first.” When the priests’ feet touched the Jordan River, the water stopped flowing so the Israelites could cross over on dry ground.


No lomoob hilay Israelita ha logal a impangako nin Apo Dioh kalla, homain hilan kanayon a danan no aliwan lomipay hila ha Kabatowan Jordan. Hinabi nan Apo Dioh kanan Josue, «Paonaen mo hilay papadi.» Ket ha itodak layna dayi ye bibitih lan papadi ha kabatowan, tampol yaynan namal-an ye danan la. Ha wanabay, nakalipay hila ha kabatowan, ta namal-an ye dinanan la palakew ha Jerico.

BT - If the Israelites will-enter the place which Apo God promised them, there is no other way-through other than they will-cross-over the River Jordan. Apo God spoke to Josue, <<(You) cause-to-go-first the priests.>> And when the feet of the priests touched the river, quickly dried-up their going-through-way. In like-that, they were-able-to-cross-over the river, for became-dry where they passed-through going-to Jerico.

After the people crossed the Jordan River, God told Joshua how to attack the powerful city of Jericho. The people obeyed God. The soldiers and priests marched around the city of Jericho once a day for six days.

Pamakalipay lan Israelita ha Kabatowan Jordan, hinabi nan Apo Dioh kanan Josue, «Dawohongen yoynay banwan Jerico. Hiyay ona mon dapaten, itobol yo hilay hohondaloh boy papadi yo a manliwod ha banwan Jerico, timinhan bengat a liwod ha loob nin anem a mangaamot.» Ket hinombong lay hinabi nan Apo Dioh.

BT - When- the Israelites -crossed-over the River Jordan, Apo God spoke to Josue, <<(You-PL) attack the town of Jerico. The first you(sg) will-do, you(PL) send soldiers and your(PL) priests to go-around-outside of the town of Jerico, just one around inside of six days.>> And they followed/obeyed what Apo God said.

On the seventh day, they marched around the city seven times. On the last time around the city, the soldiers shouted while the priests blew on their trumpets.

Ha ikapitoy mangaamot, ket nikapito hila po a okdo a nanliwod ha palibot nin banwa. Ha kahoyotan a panliwod la, legan ampantamboyok hilay papadi, ampangha hila met ye hohondaloh.

BT - On the seventh day, seven times still they went-around the outside of the city. On the last going-around-outside of theirs, while the priests are-blowing-trumpet, the soldiers also shouted.

{{:en:obs:obs-15-05.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


And the walls around the city fell down! The Israelites destroyed everything in the city as God had commanded. Only Rahab and her family were saved. They became part of the Israelites. When the rest of the Canaanites heard about what had happened to Jericho they were terrified.


Ket ha pangha boy pantamboyok la, nadama ye impalinpin a dapah a impangalad la ha banwa. Dinama lan Israelita ye matiboen banwan Jerico Jerico ta wanabay ye imbilin nan Apo Dioh kanla. Noba hiyay Rahab boy pamilya na, homain napano kanla. Kaya-bay paibat kananyatew, nakimamagha hilayna kanlan Israelita. Ha nabalitaan nin kanayon a lalahi nin tatao ha Canaan ye dinyag lan Israelita ha banwan Jerico, nalimowan hilan tobat.

BT - And in their shouting and blowing-trumpet, the stacked-upon stones which they-made-into-fence of the city were-destroyed. The Israelites destroyed the whole city of Jerico for like-that is what Apo God commanded to-them. But Rahab and her family, nothing happened to-them. Therefore from then, they sided-with the Israelites. When other races/people-groups in Canaan heard what the Israelites did to the town of Jerico, they were-frightened very-much.

The Canaanite tribe of Gibeon lied to Joshua and said they were from far away. They asked Joshua to make peace with them. God had commanded the Israelites not to make peace with any Canaanites, but Joshua and the Israelites did not ask God where the Gibeonites were from. So Joshua made peace with them.


Hilay mahaley ihtew a tatao, hilay anhabtan Gibeon a maghan kalahin tao. Noba tinago la hilay Israelita, a wanla, «Agya mataang kay kanyo, ket labay mi ye  makitagem kanyo.» Nalabay ya met ye Josue agya imbilin nan Apo Dioh ha hatew a ahe hila makitagem kanlan kanayon a kalahin tao ihtew ha Canaan.

BT - The people near there, they are-being-called Gibeon which is one race/descent of people. But they lied-to the Israelites, they-said, <<Even-though we(excl) are far-away from you(PL), we(excl) want to make-ally/side-with you(PL).>> Josue also liked even-though Apo God commanded in time-past that they not ally-with/side-with the other races of people there in Canaan.


{{:en:obs:obs-15-07.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


When the other Canaanites heard that the Gibeonites had made peace with the Israelites, they joined their armies and attacked Gibeon. The Gibeonites sent a message to Joshua asking for help.


Ha nabalitaan lan kanayon a kalahin tao ha Canaan ye dinyag lan anhabtan Gibeon, naymamagha hilan lomaban kanlan Gibeon. Ket hilay Gibeon, nangitobol hilan nangaanon tatao a makew kanan Josue ta habiyen la kana, «Josue, tageman yo kayin lomaban.»

BT - When other races of people in Canaan heard-news of what was-done by those being-called Gibeon, they united/became-one to-fight those Gibeon. And those Gibeon, they sent how many people to go to Josue and they will-say to-him, <<Josue, (you-PL) ally/side-with us(excl) to fight.>>


{{:en:obs:obs-15-08.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Joshua was angry that he had been tricked, but he gathered the Israelite army, and they marched all night to reach the Gibeonites. In the early morning they surprised their Canaanite enemies and attacked them.

Haanin, natandaan nan Josue a hilay Gibeon, mahaley manayti ye logal la kanlan Israelita. Ket napoot yay Josue, ta aliwan peteg ye hinabi la ha hatew. Noba in-ihip na, a wana, «Agya po man tinago la kayi, ket haglapan tawo hilan teed, ta nakitagem hila kantawo» wana ha ihip na. Kaya-bay tinipon nay hohondaloh na. Ket ha padeglem, kinomodang hilan palakew ha logal lan Gibeon. Ha pahanib, ikana la hilaynan labanan ye kanayon a kalahin tao a anlomaban kanlan Gibeon.


BT - Now, Josue knew that those Gibeon, close (surprise particle) is their place to the Israelites. And Josue became-angry, for not true is what they said in time-past. But he thought, he-said, <<Even-though they lied-to/deceived us(excl), we(incl) will-help them anyway, for they allied/sided-with us(incl)>> he-said in his thought. Therefore he gathered-together his solders. And when evening, they walked going-toward the place of those Gibeon. When morning, they began to-fight-against the other races of people who are-fighting-against those Gibeon.

God threw the Canaanites into confusion. God fought for Israel that day by sending large hailstones that killed many of the Canaanites.


Ha pandowohong lan Israelita, nanaglap yay Apo Dioh kanla. Ket ha main anan antomakah, hiyay dinyag nan Apo Dioh, namaodan yan mangayadet a tabolinaw a namatey kanlan kalaban lan Israelita.

BT - When the Israelites attacked, Apo God helped them. And when there are now [some] escaping, what Apo God did, he caused-to-rain large hail which killed the enemies of the Israelites.


{{:en:obs:obs-15-10.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


God also made the sun stand still in the sky so that Israel could finish defeating the Canaanites. God won a great victory for Israel that day.

Hiyay Apo Dioh, pinatgen nay tige nin mangaamot ta omon ya magboyot ye henag omon la hila mahipet ye kalaban la. Ket oli ha panaglap nan Apo Dioh, nanambot hilay Israelita ha labanan.

BT - Apo God, he caused-to-stop the movement of the sun in order that the light will-be-long-time that they will-wipe-out (lit. consume) their enemies. And because of the helping of Apo God, the Israelites won in the battle.

{{:en:obs:obs-15-11.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


After this defeat, the rest of the Canaanites who were left gathered together to attack Israel. Joshua and the Israelites attacked and destroyed them.


Pangayadi nin panambot lan Israelita, hilay napatla a Cananeo, naymamagha hilay naman a lomaban kanlan Israelita. Noba hiyay Josue boy hohondaloh na, hinambot la hilay Cananeo.

BT - When-finished is the defeating of the Israelites, those remaining who are Cananaeo, they united/became-one again to fight-against the Israelites. But Josue and his soldiers, they defeated those Cananeo.


{{:en:obs:obs-15-12.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


After this battle, God gave each tribe of Israel their own section of the Promised Land. Then God gave Israel peace along all its borders.


Pangayadi ye labanan, dinakay-dakay nan Apo Dioh ye logal a impangako na kanlan labinlowan lalahin tataon Israelita. Ket balang lalahin tataon Israelita, natanggap lay hadili lan logal. Ket hiyay Apo Dioh, pinatana na hilay lalahi nin tatao ha palibot nin ilwah nin Canaan.

BT - After the battle, Apo God divided/apportioned the place which he promised to those twelve races of the people of Israelites. And each race of people of Israelites, they received their own place. And Apo God, he caused-be-peaceful the races of people around the outside of Canaan.

When Joshua was an old man, he called all the people of Israel together. Then Joshua renewed the covenant that God had made with the Israelites at Sinai. The people promised to remain faithful to God and follow his laws.


Ha matowa yaynay Josue, tinipon na hilay kaganaan a Israelita. Hinabi nayna man kanla ye bibilin boy papangako nan Apo Dioh kanlan Israelita ha anti hila ha Mapantay nin Sinai.  Nagpangako hila ha balang magha, «Magpaholong kitawon magpakapeteg kanan Apo Dioh boy manombong kitawo ha bibilin na.»

When Josue was old already, he gathered all the Israelites. He spoke again to-them the commands and promises of Apo God to the Israelites when they are present on the Mountain of Sinai. They promised, <<We(incl) will-continue to be-true to Apo God and we(incl) will-follow/obey his commands.>>
