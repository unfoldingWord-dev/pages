After David died, his son Solomon began to rule. God spoke to Solomon and asked him what he wanted most. When Solomon asked for wisdom, God was pleased and made him the wisest man in the world. God also made him very wealthy.


Ha natey yay Poon David, hiyay anak na a nagngalan Solomon ye kahagiliyan na a manakop kanlan Israelita. Tinepet na yan Apo Dioh, a wana, <<Hinyay labay mon ibiyay ko kammo?>> Hinabi nan Solomon, a wana, <<Kadonongan, Apo, ye labay ko.>> Oli ta kadonongan ye labay nan Solomon, maaliket yay Apo Dioh, ket in-ibyay nan Apo Dioh. Ket hiyay Poon Solomon anay nag-ilyadin pinakamadonong a tao ihti ha babe lota boy pinabatnang na ya po nin Apo Dioh.

BT - When Ruler David died, his child who was-named Solomon is his replacement to have-jurisdiction-over the Israelites. Apo God asked him, he said, <<What do you want I will-give you?>> Solomon spoke, he-said, <<Wisdom, Apo, is what I want.>> Because wisdom is what Solomon wanted, Apo God was happy/excited, and he Apo God gave [it]. And Ruler Solomon now became the wisest person here and Apo God made him also rich.

In Jerusalem, Solomon built the Temple for which his father David had planned and gathered materials. Instead of the Tent of Meeting, people now worshiped God and offered sacrifices to Him in the Temple. God came and was present in the Temple, and He lived there with His people.

Hiyay Poon Solomon, impaideng nay Templo a Panggalangan kanan Apo Dioh ha banwan Jerusalem. Hinombong nay palano a dinyag nan bapa na a hiyay Poon David. Haanin, aliwaynan Toldan impadyag nan Moises ye gawien lan panggalangan boy pangihagpaan nin idigalo la kanan Apo Dioh, no aliwan hiyay Templo. Anti yay Apo Dioh ha Templo, kalamo nin tatao minamangaamot.


BT: Ruler Solomon, he caused-to-stand the Templo which is the Honoring/Worshipping-place to Apo God in the city of Jerusalem. He followed the plan which was-made by his father who was Ruler David. Now, not the Tent which Moises caused-to-be-made is what they will-use to honor and set-down to give-gift to Apo God, but rather the Templo. Apo God is present in the Temple, companioning with the people everyday.

But Solomon loved women from other countries. He disobeyed God by marrying many women, almost 1,000 of them! Many of these women came from foreign countries and brought their gods with them and worshiped them. When Solomon was old, he worshiped their gods.


Noba hiyay Solomon, malabong ye babayi a ang-adoen na a ibat ha nakahinadi a lologal. Maigit malibo ye aahawa na. Ha in-ahawa nay malabong, ahe na hinombong ye bilin nan Apo Dioh. Hilay aahawa na, kinaget lay andiohen la a aliwan peteg a dioh. Ket yabayti met ye pangobayan nan Poon Solomon a manombong ya met ha andiohen lan aahawa na. Ket aliwan hohto yati ha pamilew nan Apo Dioh.


BT - But Ruler Solomon, many are the women whom he is-loving who are from different places. Greater than one thousand are his wives. When he married many, he did not follow/obey the command of Apo God. These wives of his, they carried/brought their being-worshipped-as-god which are not true god. And this also is then basis of Ruler Solomon that he will-follow/obey also what is-being-worshipped-as-god by his wives. And not right is this in the sight of Apo God.

God was angry with Solomon and, as a punishment for Solomon’s unfaithfulness, said He would divide the kingdom of Israel in two after Solomon’s death.

Oli yatin dinyag nan Solomon, ket napoot yaynay Apo Dioh kana. Kaya-bay oli ha poot nan Apo Dioh kanan Solomon, hinabi na, <<No matey yaynay Solomon, ihiyay koynay panakopan Israel.>>

BT - Because of this which Solomon did, Apo God became-angry to-him. So because of the anger of Apo God to Solomon, he said, <<If/when Solomon will-die, I will-divide now the having-jurisdiction-place of Israel.>>

After Solomon died, his son, Rehoboam, became king. Rehoboam was a foolish man. All the people of Israel came together to confirm him as king. They also complained that Solomon had made them do a lot of hard work and pay a lot of taxes.

Ha natey yayna met ye Poon Solomon, hiyay anak na a nagngalan Rehoboam ye kahagiliyan nan bapa na a manakop ana met kanlan Israelita. Naytitipon hilay Israelita, ta magdiklamo hila kanan bayon Poon Rehoboan, hinabi la, <<Mabyat ye panakop nan bapa mo boy mablin  tobat ye paningil na nin bowih kammi. Noba no makokompang ye panakop mo, pahakop kayi kammo.>> 


BT - When Ruler Solomon died, his child who was-named Rehoboam is the replacement of his father who will-have-jurisdiction to the Israelites. The Israelites gathered-together, for they complained to the new Ruler Rehoboam, they-said, <<Heavy is the having-jurisdiction of your father and very expensive is his collecting of tax to-us(excl). But if will-be-lightened-to us(excl) in your having-jurisdiction, we(excl) will-submit to-you.>>

1. Hinyay diklamo lan Israelita kanan Poon Rehoboam?


{{:en:obs:obs-18-06.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

Rehoboam answered foolishly and told them, “You thought my father Solomon made you work hard, but I will make you work harder than he did, and I will punish you worse than he did.”

Noba hiyay Rehoboam, motaw ya, ta nakibat ya kanlan Israelita, <<Ahe malyadin komompang. Ta no mabyat ye panakop nan bapa ko kanyo, lalalo anan ingat mabyat ye panakop ko.>>

BT - But Ruler Rehoboam, he is a fool, for he answered the Israelites, <<Not possible to be-lightened. For if heavy is the having-jurisdiction of my father to-you(PL), even more now heavy is my having-jurisdiction.>>

1. Hinyay pakibat nan Poon Rehoboam kanla?

{{:en:obs:obs-18-07.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

Ten of the tribes of Israel rebelled against Rehoboam. Only two tribes remained faithful to him. These two tribes were called the kingdom of Judah.

Oli ha kalok-an nin panakop nan Poon Rehoboam, mapo kanlan lalahi nin Israel ye nangihyay kana. Lowan bengat ye napatla a ampahakop kana. Hilati ye angkahabtan, <<Panakopan Juda.>>

BT - Because of the evil of the having jurisdiction of Ruler Rehoboam, ten clans of Israel were the ones who separated from-him, they separated from-him. And two only clans were left who are-under-jurisdiction of him. Now, these are-being-called <<Jurisdiction-place of Juda.>>

2. Hinyay nalyadi ha panakop nan Poon Rehoboam?


{{:en:obs:obs-18-08.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

The other ten tribes that rebelled against Rehoboam made a man named Jeroboam their king. They were called the kingdom of Israel.


Hilay 10 a lalahin nangihyay kanan Poon Rehoboam, namili hilan pagpoon la. Ket hiyay Jeroboam ye napili la. Hilatin 10 a lalahi ye angkahabtan, <<Panakopan nin Israel.>>

BT - The 10 clans of people who separated from Ruler Rehoboam, they chose their being-ruler. And Jeroboam is the one they chose. These 10 clans are the ones being-called <<Jurisdiction-place of Israel.>>

1. Hinyay panabet kanlan 10 a lalahin tao a linomaban kanan Poon Rehoboam?

{{:en:obs:obs-18-09.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

Jeroboam rebelled against God and caused the people to sin. He built two idols for his people to worship instead of worshiping God at the Temple in the kingdom of Judah.

Hiyay Jeroboam a poon ha Panakopan Israel, adi ya ampanombong kanan Apo Dioh. Inggaygay na hila po ye tataon manyag nin kalok-an. Boy nanyag yan loway andiohen, ta omon ahe hilayna makew ye  tatao a manggalang ha Panggalangan kanan Apo Dioh ihtew ha Panakopan Juda.


BT - Jeroboam who is the ruler of the Jurisdiction-place Israel, he did not follow/obey Apo God. He incited pople to do evil. And he made two being-worshipped-as-god in order that the people will-go to worship at the Honoring-place to Apo God there in the Jurisdiction-place of Juda.

The kingdoms of Judah and Israel became enemies and often fought against each other.

Ket ha wanabay, napaykapoot ye Israel boy Juda. Ket yabay-in yaynay pinangobayan nin maheheg a paylalaban la.

BT - And in like-that, Israel and Juda became-angry-at-each-other. And this is the basis of their frequent fighting-each-other.

{{:en:obs:obs-18-11.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

In the kingdom of Israel, all the kings were evil. Many of these kings were killed by other Israelites who wanted to become king in their place.

Hiyay balang poon a nanakop ha Israel, ket mangaloke hila. Malabong kanlan hilatin popoon ye pinatey nin kapadiho lan Israelita. Ket hilatin Israelitan namatey kanla, labay lan bengat a hilabay ye manakop.

BT - Each of the rulers who took-jurisdiction of Israel, they were evil. Many are these rulers who were-killed by their fellow Israelites. And these Israelites who killed them, they just wanted that they will-have-jurisdiction.

3. Hinyay namatey kanlan popoon?

{{:en:obs:obs-18-12.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

All of the kings of Israel and most of the people worshiped idols which often included adultery and sometimes even child sacrifice.

Hilay kaganaan a popoon a nanakop ha Israel boy kalabongan kanlan Israelita ket nanggalang hila ha andiohen a aliwan peteg a dioh. Aliwan bengat yatew, ampakilaki boy ampakibabayi hila po boy an-idigalo la po ye aanak la bilang hagpa ha andiohen la.

BT - All the rulers who took-jurisdiction of Israel and many of the Israelites they honored what is-being-worshipped-as-god which are not true gods. Not just that, they committed-adultery-with-male and committed-adultery-with-female still and they still are-giving-as-gift their children as set-down to what they are-worshipping-as-god.

{{:en:obs:obs-18-13.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

The kings of Judah were descendants of David. Some of these kings were good men who ruled justly and worshiped God. But most of Judah’s kings were evil, corrupt, and idol-worshipers. Some of the kings even sacrificed their children to false gods. The people of Judah also rebelled against God and worshiped other gods.


Hilay nag-ilyadin poon ha Juda, nang-ibat hila ha lahi nan Poon David. Ket hilay kanayon, magaling hilan poon boy ampanombong hila ha kalabayan nan Apo Dioh. Noba hilay kalabongan met, mangaloke hila boy ampanggalang hila ha andiohen a aliwan peteg a dioh. Hilay nangaano kanla, an-ihagpay lay aanak la bilang digalo ha andiohen la. Ahe hilayna ampanombong kanan Apo Dioh, no aliwan panohombong layna ha aliwan peteg a dioh.

BT - Those who became ruler in Juda, they came-from the clan/descent of David. Some, they are skilled at ruling and they are following the will/desire of Apo God. But most of them, they are evil and they are-honoring/worshipping the being-worshipped-as-god which are not true god. Some of them, they are-setting-down their children as gift to those they are-worshipping-as-god. The are- not -following/obeying Apo God, but rather they are-following/obeying not true gods.
