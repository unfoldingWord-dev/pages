After David died, his son Solomon began to rule. God spoke to Solomon and asked him what he wanted most. When Solomon asked for wisdom, God was pleased and made him the wisest man in the world. God also made him very wealthy.


Ha natey yay Poon David, hiyay anak na a nagngalan Solomon ye kahagiliyan na a manakop kanlan Israelita. Tinepet na yan Apo Dioh, a wana, <<Hinyay labay mon ibiyay ko kammo?>> Hinabi nan Solomon, a wana, <<Kadonongan, Apo, ye labay ko.>> Oli ta kadonongan ye labay nan Solomon, maaliket yay Apo Dioh, ket in-ibyay nan Apo Dioh. Ket hiyay Poon Solomon anay nag-ilyadin pinakamadonong a tao ihti ha babe lota boy pinabatnang na ya po nin Apo Dioh.

BT - When Ruler David died, his child who was-named Solomon is his replacement to have-jurisdiction-over the Israelites. Apo God asked him, he said, <<What do you want I will-give you?>> Solomon spoke, he-said, <<Wisdom, Apo, is what I want.>> Because wisdom is what Solomon wanted, Apo God was happy/excited, and he Apo God gave [it]. And Ruler Solomon now became the wisest person here and Apo God made him also rich.

In Jerusalem, Solomon built the Temple for which his father David had planned and gathered materials. Instead of the Tent of Meeting, people now worshiped God and offered sacrifices to Him in the Temple. God came and was present in the Temple, and He lived there with His people.

Hiyay Poon Solomon, intaladan nay kahangkapan a gawien la a dyagen lan Templo. Ta yatin Templo ye gawien lan panggalangan boy pangihagpaan nin idigalo la kanan Apo Dioh. Ta yati ye labay nan diyagen nin bapa na hatew ha angkabi-ay ya po. Kaya-bay haanin, hiyay Poon Solomon anay manyag.

BT: Ruler Solomon, he specially-prepared the materials that they will-use to make the Templo. For this Temple is what they use for honoring-place and setting-down-place of what they will-give-as-gift to Apo God. For this is what his father wanted in-time-past when he is-alive still. So now, Ruler Solomon will-make.

But Solomon loved women from other countries. He disobeyed God by marrying many women, almost 1,000 of them! Many of these women came from foreign countries and brought their gods with them and worshiped them. When Solomon was old, he worshiped their gods.

Hiyay Poon Solomon, maigit malibo ye aahawa na. Hilatin aahawa na, nang-ibat hila ha malabong a lalahi boy kinaget lay andiohen la a aliwan peteg a dioh. Ket yabayti met ye pangobayan nan Poon Solomon a manombong ya met ha andiohen lan aahawa na. Ket aliwan hohto yati ha pamilew nan Apo Dioh.

BT - Ruler Solomon, greater than one thousand are his wives. These wives of his, they came-from many clans/races and they carried/brought their being-worshipped-as-god which are not true god. And this also is basis of Ruler Solomon that he will-follow/obey also what is-being-worshipped-as-god by his wives. And not right is this in the sight of Apo God.

1. Anoy ahawa nan Solomon?

2. Taket ta nanombong yay Solomon ha diohdiohan?

God was angry with Solomon and, as a punishment for Solomon’s unfaithfulness, said He would divide the kingdom of Israel in two after Solomon’s death.

Oli yatin dinyag nan Solomon, ket napoot yaynay Apo Dioh kana. Ket oli ha poot nan Apo Dioh kanan Solomon, inalih nay kagitna nin panakopan na.

BT - Because of this which Solomon did, Apo God became-angry to-him. And because of the anger of Apo God to Solomon, he removed half of his having-jurisdiction-place.

After Solomon died, his son, Rehoboam, became king. Rehoboam was a foolish man. All the people of Israel came together to confirm him as king. They also complained that Solomon had made them do a lot of hard work and pay a lot of taxes.

Ha natey yayna met ye Poon Solomon, hiyay anak na a nagngalan Rehoboam ye kahagiliyan nan bapa na a manakop ana met kanlan Israelita. Haanin, nagdiklamo hilay Israelita kanan bayon Poon Rehoboam, a wanla, <<Mabyat ye panakop nan bapa mo ha hatew boy mabling tobat ye paningil nan boih kammi. Noba no mapakompangan kayi nin panakop mo, maghilbi kayi kammo.>>

BT - When Ruler Solomon died, his child who was-named Rehoboam is the replacement of his father who will-have-jurisdiction to the Israelites. Now, the Israelites complained to the new Ruler Rehoboam, they-said, <<Heavy is the having-jurisdiction of your father in time-past and very expensive is his collecting of tax to-us(excl). But if will-be-lightened-to us(excl) in your having-jurisdiction, we(excl) will-serve you.>>

1. Hinyay diklamo lan Israelita kanan Poon Rehoboam?


{{:en:obs:obs-18-06.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

Rehoboam answered foolishly and told them, “You thought my father Solomon made you work hard, but I will make you work harder than he did, and I will punish you worse than he did.”

Noba nakibat yay Poon Rehoboam kanla, <<Ahe malyadin komompang. Ta no mabyat ye panakop nan bapa ko kanyo, lalalo anan ingat mabyat ye panakop ko.>>

BT - But Ruler Rehoboam answered them, <<Not possible to be-lightened. For if heavy is the having-jurisdiction of my father to-you(PL), even more now heavy is my having-jurisdiction.>>

1. Hinyay pakibat nan Poon Rehoboam kanla?

{{:en:obs:obs-18-07.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

Ten of the tribes of Israel rebelled against Rehoboam. Only two tribes remained faithful to him. These two tribes were called the kingdom of Judah.

Oli ha kalok-an nin panakop nan Poon Rehoboam, hilay mapo a lahi nin Israel, linomaban hila kana. Ket lolowa tanan lahi ye napatla a ampahakop kana. Haanin, hilati ye angkahabtan <<Panakopan Juda>>.

BT - Because of the evil of the having jurisdiction of Ruler Rehoboam, the ten clans of Israel, they fought-against him. And two only clans were left who are-under-jurisdiction of him. Now, these are-being-called <<Jurisdiction-place of Juda.>>

1. Taket ta linomaban hilay 10 a lalahin Israelita?

2. Hinyay nalyadi ha panakop nan Poon Rehoboam?


{{:en:obs:obs-18-08.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

The other ten tribes that rebelled against Rehoboam made a man named Jeroboam their king. They were called the kingdom of Israel.

Hilay 10 a kalahin tao a linomaban kanan Poon Rehoboam, namili hilan pagpoon la met a hiyay Jeroboam. Ket hilatin 10 a lalahin tao, hilati ye angkahabtan <<Panakopan Israel.>>

BT - The 10 clans of people who fought-against Ruler Rehoboam, they chose Jeroboam to rule them. And these 10 clans of people, they are-be-called <<Jurisdiction-place of Israel.>>

1. Hinyay panabet kanlan 10 a lalahin tao a linomaban kanan Poon Rehoboam?

{{:en:obs:obs-18-09.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

Jeroboam rebelled against God and caused the people to sin. He built two idols for his people to worship instead of worshiping God at the Temple in the kingdom of Judah.

Hiyay Jeroboam a poon ha Panakopan Israel, adi ya nanombong kanan Apo Dioh no aliwan nangombinyo yan tatao a manyag nin kalok-an boy nanyag yan andiohen la a aliwan peteg a dioh. Ket haanin, ahe hilayna ampakew a maghimba ha Templo ihtew ha banwan Jerusalem, a anti ha Panakopan Juda.

BT - Jeroboam who is the ruler of the Jurisdiction-place Israel, he did not follow/obey Apo God but rather he convinced people to do evil and he made their worshipping-as-god which is not true god. And now, they did not now go to worship at the Templo there in the city of Jerusalem, which is present in the Jurisdiction-place of Juda.

1. Way-omen ye pamoon nan Poon Jeroboam?

{{:en:obs:obs-18-10.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

The kingdoms of Judah and Israel became enemies and often fought against each other.

Ket ha wanabay, napaykapoot ye Israel boy Juda. Ket yabay-in yaynay pangobayan nin paylalaban la.

BT - And in like-that, Israel and Juda became-angry-at-each-other. And this is the basis of their fighting-each-other.

{{:en:obs:obs-18-11.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

In the kingdom of Israel, all the kings were evil. Many of these kings were killed by other Israelites who wanted to become king in their place.

Hilay popoon a nanakop ha Israel, mangaloke hila. Malabong kanlan hilatin popoon ye pinatey nin kapadiho lan Israelita. Ket hilatin Israelitan namatey kanla, labay lan bengat a hilabay ye manakop.

BT - The rulers who had-jurisdiction to Israel, they were evil. Many are these rules who were-killed by their fellow Israelites. And these Israelites who killed them, they just wanted that they will-have-jurisdiction.

All of the kings of Israel and most of the people worshiped idols which often included adultery and sometimes even child sacrifice.

Lahat ng hari sa Kaharian ng Israel ay sumasamba sa mga rebulto. Minsan ay nangangalunya din sila at inihahandog pa ang sariling anak sa mga rebulto.

Malabong hilay Israelita ye ampaghimba ha andiohen a aliwan peteg a dioh. Minghan ampakilaki boy ampakibabayi hila boy an-ihagpa lay anak la bilang digalo ha andiohen la.

BT - Many Israelites are worshipping the being-worshipped-as-god which are not true god. Sometimes they are-committing-adultery-with-male and committinig-adultery-with-female and they are-setting-down their children as gifts to what they are-worshipping-as-god.

1. Hilay ampaghimba kanan Apo Dioh, way-ihtew hila ampakew a ampaghimba?

{{:en:obs:obs-18-13.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

The kings of Judah were descendants of David. Some of these kings were good men who ruled justly and worshiped God. But most of Judah’s kings were evil, corrupt, and idol-worshipers. Some of the kings even sacrificed their children to false gods. The people of Judah also rebelled against God and worshiped other gods.


Hilay nag-ilyadin poon ha Juda, nang-ibat hila ha lahi nan Poon David. Ket hilay kanayon, magaling hilan poon boy ampanombong hila ha kalabayan nan Apo Dioh. Noba hilay kanayon met, mangaloke hila boy ampanggalang hila ha andiohen a aliwan peteg a dioh. Hilay nangaano kanla, an-ihagpay lay aanak la bilang digalo ha andiohen la. Ahe hilayna ampanombong kanan Apo Dioh, no aliwan panohombong layna ha aliwan peteg a dioh.

BT - Those who became ruler in Juda, they came-from the clan/descent of David. Some, they are skilled at ruling and they are following the will/desire of Apo God. But others also, they are evil and they are-honoring/worshipping the being-worshipped-as-god which are not true god. Some of them, they are-setting-down their children as gift to those they are-worshipping-as-god. The are- not -following/obeying Apo God, but rather they are-following/obeying not true gods.
