After David died, his son Solomon began to rule. God spoke to Solomon and asked him what he wanted most. When Solomon asked for wisdom, God was pleased and made him the wisest man in the world. God also made him very wealthy.


Ha natey yay Poon David, hiyay anak na a nagngalan Solomon ye kahagiliyan na a manakop kanlan Israelita. Agya man anak ya po a amapanakop hatew, ket in-inged na yan Apo Dioh boy binyanan na yan kadonongan.

In Jerusalem, Solomon built the Temple for which his father David had planned and gathered materials. Instead of the Tent of Meeting, people now worshiped God and offered sacrifices to Him in the Temple. God came and was present in the Temple, and He lived there with His people.

Hiyay Poon Solomon, intaladan nay kahangkapan a gawien la a dyagen lan Panggalangan kanan Apo Dioh. Ta yati ye in-ihip nan bapa na hatew a ahe na nadyag. Kaya-bay haanin, hiyay Poon Solomon anay manyag.

But Solomon loved women from other countries. He disobeyed God by marrying many women, almost 1,000 of them! Many of these women came from foreign countries and brought their gods with them and worshiped them. When Solomon was old, he worshiped their gods.

Hiyay Poon Solomon, maigit malibo ye aahawa na. Hilatin aahawa na, nang-ibat hila ha malabong a lalahi boy kinaget lay andiohen la a aliwan peteg a dioh. Ket yabayti met ye pangobayan nan Poon Solomon a manombong ya met ha andiohen lan aahawa na. Ket aliwan hohto yati ha pamilew nan Apo Dioh.

God was angry with Solomon and, as a punishment for Solomon’s unfaithfulness, said He would divide the kingdom of Israel in two after Solomon’s death.

Oli yatin dinyag nan Solomon, ket napoot yaynay Apo Dioh kana. Ket hiyay dinapat nan Apo Dioh, pinag-ilyadi nan loway pahen ye panakopan nan Poon Solomon. Ket hiyay magha, in-ihyay na kana.

1. Hinyay tanam nan Apo Dioh kanan Poon Solomon?

After Solomon died, his son, Rehoboam, became king. Rehoboam was a foolish man. All the people of Israel came together to confirm him as king. They also complained that Solomon had made them do a lot of hard work and pay a lot of taxes.


Ha natey yaynay Poon Solomon, hiyay anak na a nagngalan Rehoboam ye kahagiliyan nan bapa na a manakop kanlan Israelita, ta hiya ye kalabayan la. Haanin, nagdiklamo hilay Israelita kanan bayon Poon Rehoboam, a wanla, <<Mabyat ye panakop nan bapa mo ha hatew boy mabling tobat ye paningil nan boih kammi. Noba no mapakompangan kayi nin panakop mo, maghilbi kayi kammo.>>

1. Hinyay diklamo lan Israelita kanan Poon Rehoboam?


{{:en:obs:obs-18-06.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

Rehoboam answered foolishly and told them, “You thought my father Solomon made you work hard, but I will make you work harder than he did, and I will punish you worse than he did.”

Noba nakibat yay Poon Rehoboam kanla, <<Ahe malyadin komompang. Ta no mabyat ye panakop nan bapa ko kanyo, lalalo anan ingat mabyat ye panakop ko.>>

1. Hinyay pakibat nan Poon Rehoboam kanla?

{{:en:obs:obs-18-07.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

Ten of the tribes of Israel rebelled against Rehoboam. Only two tribes remained faithful to him. These two tribes were called the kingdom of Judah.

Yabayti ye hangkan a linomaban hilay 10 a kanayon a kalahin Israelita kanan Poon Rehoboam. Ket oli kananyatin kalok-an a panakop na, loloa tanay lalahin tao ye napatla a ampagpahakop po kana. Ket haanin, hilatin napatla, anhabtan la hilaynan <<Panakopan Juda>>.

2. Hinyay nalyadi ha panakop nan Poon Rehoboam?


{{:en:obs:obs-18-08.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

The other ten tribes that rebelled against Rehoboam made a man named Jeroboam their king. They were called the kingdom of Israel.

Hilay 10 a kalahin tao a linomaban kanan Poon Rehoboam, pinili la yay Jeroboam a mamoon kanla. Ket hilatin 10 a lalahin tao, hilabay anay habiyen la a <<Panakopan Israel.>>

1. Hinyay panabet kanlan 10 a lalahin tao a linomaban kanan Poon Rehoboam?

{{:en:obs:obs-18-09.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

Jeroboam rebelled against God and caused the people to sin. He built two idols for his people to worship instead of worshiping God at the Temple in the kingdom of Judah.

Hiyay Jeroboam a poon ha Panakopan Israel, adi ya nanombong kanan Apo Dioh no aliwan nangombinyo yan tatao a manyag nin kalok-an boy nanyag yan andiohen la a aliwan peteg a dioh. Ket haanin, ahe hilayna ampakew a maghimba ha Panggalangan kanan Apo Dioh ihtew ha banwan Jerusalem, a anti ha Panakopan Juda.

1. Way-omen ye pamoon nan Poon Jeroboam?

2. Taket ta ahe hila nakew a maghimba ye tatao?

{{:en:obs:obs-18-10.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

The kingdoms of Judah and Israel became enemies and often fought against each other.

Ket ha wanabay, napaykapoot ye Israel boy Juda. Ket yabay-in yaynay hangkan nin paylalaban la.

1. Taket ta napaylaban hilay Israel boy Juda?

{{:en:obs:obs-18-11.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

In the kingdom of Israel, all the kings were evil. Many of these kings were killed by other Israelites who wanted to become king in their place.

Hilay popoon a nanakop ha Israel, mangaloke hila. Ket hilay kanayon kanla, ha kamwa, anhombongen lay kalabayan nan Apo Dioh, noba ha kalinghoyotan ana, padiho hila met ateed a nakihombong ha andiohan nin tatao a aliwan peteg a dioh. Malabong kanlan hilatin popoon ye pinatey nin kapadiho lan Israelita. Ket hilatin Israelitan namatey kanla, labay lan bengat a hilabay ye manakop.

3. Hinyay namatey kanlan popoon?

All of the kings of Israel and most of the people worshiped idols which often included adultery and sometimes even child sacrifice.

Malabong hilay Israelita ye ampaghimba ha andiohen a aliwan peteg a dioh. Noba hilay ampanggalang ha Dioh a kaptegan, nakew hilan maghimba ha Panggalangan kanan Apo Dioh, ihtew ha Jerusalem.

1. Hilay ampaghimba kanan Apo Dioh, way-ihtew hila ampakew a ampaghimba?

The kings of Judah were descendants of David. Some of these kings were good men who ruled justly and worshiped God. But most of Judah’s kings were evil, corrupt, and idol-worshipers. Some of the kings even sacrificed their children to false gods. The people of Judah also rebelled against God and worshiped other gods.

Hilay nag-ilyadin poon ha Juda, nang-ibat hila ha lahi nan David. Hilay kanayon, magaling hilan ampamoon boy ampanombong hila ha kalabayan nan Apo Dioh. Noba hilay kanayon met, mangaloke hila boy ampanggalang hila ha andiohen a aliwan peteg a dioh. Anhaaden la hila po ye malabay maghimba ha Panggalangan kanan Apo Dioh ihtew ha Jerusalem. Hilay kanayon met a tatao ha Juda, ahe la ya an-ibabano ye Apo Dioh.
