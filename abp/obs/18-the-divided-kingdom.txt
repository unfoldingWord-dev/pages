After David died, his son Solomon began to rule. God spoke to Solomon and asked him what he wanted most. When Solomon asked for wisdom, God was pleased and made him the wisest man in the world. God also made him very wealthy.


Ha natey yay Poon David, hiyay anak na a nagngalan Solomon ye kahagiliyan na a manakop kanlan Israelita. Agya man anak ya po a amapanakop hatew, ket in-inged na yan Apo Dioh boy binyanan na yan kadonongan. Ket hiyay Poon Solomon anay pinakamadonong a tao ihti ha babe lota boy pinabatnang na ya po nin Apo Dioh.

1. Hinyay kahagiliyan nan Poon David?

2. Hinyay dinyag nan Apo Dioh kanan Poon Solomon?

In Jerusalem, Solomon built the Temple for which his father David had planned and gathered materials. Instead of the Tent of Meeting, people now worshiped God and offered sacrifices to Him in the Temple. God came and was present in the Temple, and He lived there with His people.

Hiyay Poon Solomon, intaladan nay kahangkapan a gawien la a dyagen lan Panggalangan kanan Apo Dioh. Ta yati ye in-ihip nan bapa na hatew a ahe na nadyag. Kaya-bay haanin, hiyay Poon Solomon anay manyag.

1. Hinyay dyagen nan Solomon?

2. Hinyay onan tao a nang-ihip a manyag nin Panggalangan kanan Apo Dioh?

But Solomon loved women from other countries. He disobeyed God by marrying many women, almost 1,000 of them! Many of these women came from foreign countries and brought their gods with them and worshiped them. When Solomon was old, he worshiped their gods.

Hiyay Solomon, malabong ye ahawa na. Omigit la po ha 1,000. Nangibat hilayati ha malabong a lalahi. Ket hilatin aahawa na, adi mihyay met ha andiohen la. Ket yabayti met ye pinanangobayan nan Solomon a manombong ya met ha andiohen a ampanggalangan la.

God was angry with Solomon and, as a punishment for Solomon’s unfaithfulness, said He would divide the kingdom of Israel in two after Solomon’s death.

Oli yatin dinyag nan Solomon, napoot yaynay Apo Dioh. Hiyay dinapat na, in-ilbo nay panakopan nan Solomon.

After Solomon died, his son, Rehoboam, became king. Rehoboam was a foolish man. All the people of Israel came together to confirm him as king. They also complained that Solomon had made them do a lot of hard work and pay a lot of taxes.

Ha natey yaynay poon Solomon, hiyay anak na a Rehoboam ye kahagilian na a manakop kanlan Israelita. Ta hiya ye kalabayan la. Noba maloke yay Rehoboam. Hilay Israelita, nagdeklamo hila kana, a wanla, “Maloke ye panakop nan Solomon a bapa mo boy mabyat ye paningil nan boih kammi”.

Rehoboam answered foolishly and told them, “You thought my father Solomon made you work hard, but I will make you work harder than he did, and I will punish you worse than he did.”

Noba impakibat nan Rehoboam kanla, “Matataba yay tanggiginihko dinan ha awak nan bapa ko. Binadog na kawon pamatok hatew noba hiko, latikoen katawo!”

Ten of the tribes of Israel rebelled against Rehoboam. Only two tribes remained faithful to him. These two tribes were called the kingdom of Judah.

Yabayti ye hangkan a linomaban hilay 10 a tribon Israelita kanan Rehoboam. Yatin ogali nan Rehoboam, ket lowa hilaynan bengat a tribo ye nagpahakop kana, a napangalanan, “Panakopan Juda”.

The other ten tribes that rebelled against Rehoboam made a man named Jeroboam their king. They were called the kingdom of Israel.

Hiyay Jeroboam ye pinili lan 10 a tribo a lomaban kanan Rehoboam. Ket napangalanan yatin, “Panakopan Israel”.

{{:en:obs:obs-18-09.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

Jeroboam rebelled against God and caused the people to sin. He built two idols for his people to worship instead of worshiping God at the Temple in the kingdom of Judah.

Hiyay Jeroboam, adi ya nanombong kanan Apo Dioh boy nangombinyo yan tatao a manyag nin kahalanan. Ta nanyag yan  loway kalintatao a galangen la ta omon hila ahe makew  a maghimba kanan Apo Dioh ha banwan Jerusalem, a anti ha hakop nin Juda.

The kingdoms of Judah and Israel became enemies and often fought against each other.

Ket ha wanabay, napaykapoot ye Israel boy Juda. Ket yati ye pinangobayan/pinangibatan nin paylalaban la.

{{:en:obs:obs-18-11.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

In the kingdom of Israel, all the kings were evil. Many of these kings were killed by other Israelites who wanted to become king in their place.

Mangaloke hilay popoon a nanakop ha banwan Israel. Hilay kanayon, nanombong hila kanan Apo Dioh ha onan pamoon. Noba ha pangayadi, nanggalang hila ha andiohen la. Malabong kanlan hilatin popoon ye pinatey nin kapadiho lan Israelita makaoli ha kalabayan la, a mag-ilyadi hilan popoon.

{{:en:obs:obs-18-12.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

All of the kings of Israel and most of the people worshiped idols which often included adultery and sometimes even child sacrifice.

Kalabongan kanlan Israelita ye ampanggalang ha andiohen. Noba hilay ampanggalang kanan peteg a Dioh, nakew hila ha banwan Jerusalem. Ta ihtew hila ampanggalang kanan Apo Dioh.

The kings of Judah were descendants of David. Some of these kings were good men who ruled justly and worshiped God. But most of Judah’s kings were evil, corrupt, and idol-worshipers. Some of the kings even sacrificed their children to false gods. The people of Judah also rebelled against God and worshiped other gods.

Hilay nag-ilyadin popoon ha Juda, nangibat hila ha lahi nan David. Ket hila ye nag-ilyadin poon ha Juda. Hilay kanayon, manged hilan manakop boy mapanombong hila kanan Apo Dioh. Noba hilay kanayon, mangaloke hila boy ampanggalang hila ha andiohen.  Hinaad la hilay tatao a manggalang kanan Apo Dioh ha Himbaan.  Hilay kanayon met a tatao ha Juda ahe la ya binalay ye Apo Dioh.
