After Jesus was crucified, the unbelieving Jewish leaders said to Pilate, “That liar, Jesus, said he would rise from the dead after three days. The tomb must be guarded so that his disciples do not steal the body and then say he has risen from the dead.”

Ha kabekahan, mangaamot nin pagpainawa, hilay popoon nin papadi boy Papariseo, nakew hila kanan Pilato, ket hinabi la, a, “Apo, naihipan mi, ha hatew a angkabi-ay ya po yain a mabongkok, hinabi na a, ‘Pangalabah nin tatloy mangaamot, mabi-ay akon oman.’ Kaya-bay an-awoken mi kammo a pakabilinan mo hilay hohondaloh mo a pakabantayan la yan manged ye nangilbengan kana anggan malabah ye tatloy mangaamot. Ta maka takawen la yan mānombong na ye bangkay na omen lan bengat ibalita a nabi-ay yan oman. No wanabay ye malyadi, ket lalalo anan panalingo la yati dinan ha ona.” (Luk 23:62-64)

Pilate said, “Make the tomb as secure as you can.” So they sealed the stone at the entrance of the tomb and put soldiers there to make sure no one could steal the body.

Kaya-bay hiyay dapah a impanleneb ha nangilbengan, ket minalkaan laya, omon matandaan no main manlokat boy nangibantak hila nin nangaanon bantay. (Mat 27:66)

The day after Jesus was buried was a Sabbath, a day of rest. Very early on the morning after the Sabbath, several women went to Jesus’ tomb to put more burial spices on his body.

Ha mahanib-hanib nin mangaamot nin Dominggo, hilayatew a babayin nakilakew kanan Apo Jesus ha hatew, nakew hila ihtew ha nangilbengan kanan Apo Jesus, ta kinaget lay malabong a pabangoh a inhadya la.  (Luk 24:1)

There was a great earthquake. An angel of the Lord appeared from heaven, as bright as lightning. He rolled away the stone that was covering the entrance to the tomb and sat on it. The soldiers guarding the tomb were terrified and fell to the ground like dead men.

Haanin, tampol anan nanlayon nin mak-haw. Ket hiyay pānobolen nin Dioh, inomaypa yan nangibat ha langit, ket intolin nay dapah a pinanleneb ha ilwangan nin nangilbengan. Pangayadi iniknoan nay dapah a impanleneb. Ket hiyay lopana, ampakapolag ya a ba-mon henag kilat boy hiyay bado na, tobat a kapotian. Ket hilay babantay, ha nakit la yay pānobolen nin Dioh, namigpig hilan nangapoang a ba-mon natey, oli ha limo la. (Mat 28:2-4)

The angel told the women, “Do not be afraid. Jesus is not here. He has risen from the dead, just like he said he would! Look in the tomb and see.” The women looked into the tomb and saw where Jesus had been lying. His body was not there!

Haanin, hiyay pānobolen nin Dioh, hinabi na kanlan bābayi, a wana, “Adi kawo angkalimo. Ta tanda kon antapolenyo yay Apo Jesus a impako la ha kodoh ha hatew. Ahe yayna ihti, ta nabi-ay yaynan oman a omen ha hinabi na kanyo ha hatew. Higi, makew kawo ihti, ta bilewen yoy nangipototan kana.” Ket binilew lan peteg. (Mat 28:5-6)

Then the angel told the women, “Tell the disciples that Jesus has risen from the dead and is going before you into Galilee.”

Pangayadi, hinabi nan pānobolen nin Dioh kanla, a wana, “Dandalien yoynay ipatanda kanlan mānombong na, habiyen yo kanla a, ‘Nabi-ay yaynan oman boy naona yayna ha Galilea. Ket ihtew yo yayna makit.’ Adi yo anliwaan yatin hinabi ko kanyo.”  (Mat 28:7)

The women were full of fear and great joy. They ran to tell the disciples the good news.

Haanin, nalimowan hilan tobat ye loway bābayi, noba tobat met ye kalighaan la oli ha hinabi nan pānobolen nin Dioh. Kaya-bay tampol hilan inomalih ye mānombong nan Apo Jesus. (Mat 28:8)

On the way, Jesus appeared to them, and they worshiped him. Jesus said, “Do not be afraid. Go and tell my disciples that I will see them in Galilee.”

Legan angkomodang hila, kapipikhaan nahagana la yay Apo Jesus. Ket hinabi na kanla, a wana, “Komohta kawo.” Hinomaley hila kana ta tinakeh lay bitihna boy nanggalang hila kana. Haanin, hinabi nan Apo Jesus kanla, wana, “Adi kawo angkalimo. Manige kawoyna, ta ibalita yo kanlan kakatongno ko a makew hila ha Galilea ta ihtew la ko makit.” (Mat 28:9-10)
