One day, Jesus was teaching many tax collectors and sinners who were with him.

The religious leaders were grumbling because Jesus was treating these people as friends. So Jesus told this story.

Oli kananhiyatin nange la, hilay Papariseo boy hilay mamaihtodo nin bibilin, naytatanobotob hila, a wanla, “Bilewen yo yain a tao! Antanggapen na hilay māgkahalanan boy ampakiadap ya kanlan mangan.” Ket hinabi nan Apo Jesus ye alimbawa kanlan naytatanobotob, a wana, (Luke 15:2, 11a)

“There was a man who had two sons. The younger son told his father, ‘Father, I want my inheritance now!’ So the father divided his property between the two sons.”

“Main maghay lāki a main loway aanak a lālaki. Hinabi nan makaydeng kanan bapa na, a wana, ‘Tatang, ibiyay moyna kangko ye atag ko ha babandi mo a tawiden ko.’ Kaya-bay, hiyay bapa la, ket pinay-atag nay babandi na kanlan loway aanak na.” (Luke 15:11b-12)

“Soon the younger son gathered all that he had and went far away and wasted his money in sinful living.”

“Ahe naboyot, hiyay makaydeng, inlako nay bandi a atag na haka yayna inomalih ihtew. Ket kinaget nay pilak na. Nakew ya ha mataang a logal. Ta ihtew na ginahtoh ye pilak na ha pagpakapda na. (Luke 15:13)

“At that time a severe famine came on the land, and he had no money to buy food. So he took the only job he could find, feeding pigs. He was so miserable and hungry that he wanted to eat the pigs’ food.”

Haanin, naoboh naynay pilak na. Ket kananyatew met ateed a panaon, ket nandogi ye kaidapan la ihtew. Ta homain hilan pamamangan. Ket hiyay dinyag na, nakew yan nakiopa kanan maghay tao ihtew. Haanin, intobol na ya ha padayan na. Ta dinyag na yan ipoh a mamakan nin bababoy. Oli ta homain namiyay kana nin pamamangan, ket nabitlan yan tobat. Kaya-bay labay nayna dayin kanen ye angkanen nin bababoy.” (Luke 15:14-16)

“Finally, the younger son said to himself, ‘What am I doing? All my father’s servants have plenty to eat, and yet here I am starving. I will go back to my father and ask to be one of his servants.’”

“Ha naihipan nay angkalyadi kana, hinabi na ha hadili na, a wana, ‘Ihtew kammi, hilay iipoh nan bapa ko, angkabhoy hila boy lohbo ye pamamangan la. Noba hiko haanin, ket anti ko ihtin angkapatiya-tiyaan nin bitil. Mag-odong akoyna kanan bapa ko. Ta habiyen ko kana, a wangko, “Tatang, nagkahalanan ako kanan Apo Dioh boy kammo. Kaya-bay ahe moyna an-ibilang a anak mo ko, no aliwan ibilang mo ko tanan magha kanlan iipoh mo.” ’ (Luke 15:17-19)

“While the younger son was still far away, his father saw him and felt compassion for him. He ran to his son and hugged him and kissed him.”

Haanin, moli yayna kanan bapa na. Noba ha mataang-taang ya po ha baey la, natamolaw na yaynan bapa na. Ket nalonoh ya kana. Kaya-bay nayew yay bapa nan nanagana kana. Ta tinakeh na ya boy inomaan na ya.” (Luke 15:20)

“The son said, ‘Father, I have sinned against God and against you. I am not worthy to be your son. Let me be your servant instead.’”

“But his father told one of his servants, ‘Go quickly! Bring the best clothes and put them on my son! Put a ring on his finger and put sandals on his feet. Then kill the best calf so we can have a feast, because my son was dead, but now he is alive! He was lost, but now he is found!’”

“Noba hinabi nan bapa na kanlan iipoh na, a wana, ‘Magtige kawoyna! Manandali kawon mangwa nin tapih a pinakamatampa, ta ipahoot yo kana. Pahinghingan yo ya boy pahapatohan yo ya. Boy mangwa kawon oybon baka a pinataba, ta patyen yo ya. Mangan kitawo boy maghayaghag! Ta yatin anak ko, nabaan ko yan natey ana, noba angkabi-ay ya po manayti! Nabaan kon nikatak yayna noba noli ya met ateed!’ (Luke 15:22-24)

“And they began to celebrate. Before long, the older son came home from working in the field. He heard the music and dancing and wondered what was happening.”

Ket haanin, nandogi hilaynan maghayaghag. Kananyatew a odah, hiyay makaagat a anak na, ket anti ya ha padayan. Ha ampoli yayna boy maahaley yayna ha baey la, nakange yan togtogan lan antomalek. Kaya-bay ha nakit na yay maghay ipoh la, hinagyat na yan homaley. Ta nanepet ya, a wana, ‘Hinya yain a togotogan?’ (Luke 15:24b-26)

“When he found out that there was a party because his brother had come home, he was very angry and would not go into the house. His father came out and begged him to join the party, but he refused.”

Nakibat yay ipoh, a wana, ‘Ampaghayaghag hila. Ta nakalateng yaynay katongno mo. Angkabi-ay ya manayti boy maligha ye laman na. Kaya-bay impapatey nan bapa mo ye oybon baka a pinataba.’ ” 
Haanin, nagpoot yaynay makaagat. Kaya-bay ahe nayna labay ye homlep ha baey la. Ket nilakew na yan bapa na, ta hinabi na, a wana, ‘Homlep kayna!’ (Luke 15:27-28)

“He said, ‘All these years I’ve worked so faithfully for you! I never disobeyed you, and still you did not even give me one small goat so I could celebrate with my friends. But when this son of yours wastes your money on sinful behavior, you kill the best calf for him!’”

“Noba nakibat ya kanan bapa na, a wana, ‘Naboyot akoynan ampaghilbi kammo boy nanombong ako ha kaganaan a labay mo. Noba agya minghan, ahe mo ko po binyan agya bengat maghay oybon kambing ta omon ako makapaghayaghag a lamo ko hilay gagayyem ko. Noba yain a anak mo, inlompoh nay bandi mo ha pamakilamo na kanlan babayin babayadan. Ket ha linomateng ya, impamatey mo ya po nin oybon baka a pinataba.’ ” (Luke 15:29-30)

“The father answered, ‘My son, you are always with me, and everything I have is yours. But it is right for us to celebrate, because your brother was dead, but now is alive. He was lost, but now is found!’”

“Nakibat yay bapa na, a wana, ‘Anak ko, hika ye lanang kon kalamo. Ket hilay kaganaan a babandi ko, pagkonin moyna. Noba katapolan tawoy maghayaghag boy mag-aliket. Ta yatin katongno mo, nabaan ko yaynan natey, noba angkabi-ay ya po manayti! Nabaan ko met a nikatak yayna, noba noli ya met ateed!’ ” (Luke 15:31-32)
