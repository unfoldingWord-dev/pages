Jesus sent his disciples to preach and teach. When they returned, they told Jesus what they had taught and done. Then Jesus invited them to come with him to a quiet place to rest for a while. So, they got into a boat and left.

Hilay apostol nan Apo Jesus a intobol na, ha nag-odong hilayna, imbalita layna kana ye kaganaan a dinyag la. Ket ha nayadi lan imbalita kana, hinagyat na hilaynan makew ha banwan Bethsaida. (Luke 9:10)

But there were many people who saw Jesus and the disciples leave. They ran along the shore of the lake to get to the other side ahead of them. When Jesus and the disciples arrived, they were greeted by great crowds of people.

Noba ha natandaan lan kalabongan a tatao a inomalih hilayna, kinomamat hila kanla. Ket hiyay Apo Jesus, manged ye pananggap na kanla. Ket in-adal na kanla ye tongkol ha panakop nan Apo Dioh boy pinaitaah na hilay ampaghakit. (Luke 9:11)

The crowd had over 5,000 men in it, not counting the women and children. Jesus felt great kindness towards the people. To Jesus, these people were like sheep without a shepherd. So he taught them and healed their sick.

Hilay bilang nin lālaki ihtew, ket 5,000. Haanin, nalonoh yay Apo Jesus kanla. Ket hilay ampaghakit, pinaitaah na hila. (Matt 14:14b)

As it got later in the evening, the disciples told Jesus, “It is late and there are no towns nearby. Send the people away so they can go get something to eat.”

Ha andomeglem ana, hilay labinloway apostol nan Apo Jesus, ket hinomaley hila kana, ta hinabi la kana, a wanla, “Maihtodo, anti kitawo ha logal a homain tao. Kaya-bay ipakihabi mo kanlan tatao a omalih hilayna ihti, ta makew hila ha mangahaley a babadyo ta omon hila makakit nin pamamangan la boy pagdagohan la.” (Luke 9:12)

But Jesus said to them, “You give them something to eat!” The disciples responded, “How can we do that? We only have five loaves of bread and two fish.”

Noba nakibat yay Apo Jesus kanla, a wana, “Ahe! Katapolan a hikawoy mamiyay nin pamamangan la.” 
Nakibat hila kanan Apo Jesus, a wanla, “Limay tinapay bengat boy loway malanghit ye anti ihti. Makew kayi laweh a manaliw nin pamamangan la?” (Luke 9:13)

Jesus called the crowd to him and told them to sit down in groups on the grass.

Noba hinabi nan Apo Jesus kanlan ang-adalan na, a wana, “Paiknoen yo hilan manilimampoꞌ ha balang pohto.” Ket pinaikno la hilay kaganaan a tatao. (Luke 9:14-15)

Then he took the five loaves of bread and the two fish, looked up to heaven, and blessed the food.

Haanin, hiyay dinyag nan Apo Jesus, kingwa nay limay tinapay boy loway malanghit. Ket tinomangal ya, ta nagpahalamat ya kanan Apo Dioh. (Luke 9:16a)

Jesus then started breaking the bread and fish. He gave the pieces to his disciples to give to the people. The disciples kept passing out the food, and it never ran out! All the people ate and were satisfied.

Ket pinihi-pihiꞌ nay limay tinapay boy pinotoh-potoh nay loway malanghit haka na in-ibiyay kanlan ang-adalan na ta omon la itayak kanlan tatao. Kaganaan lan tatao ihtew, ket nangan hila boy nangabhoy. (Luke 9:16b-17a)

The disciples even picked up twelve baskets full of leftover food that had not been eaten. All the food came from the five loaves of bread and two fish.

Hiyay napatla a napihi-pihiꞌ a tinapay boy napotoh-potoh a malanghit, ket tinipon lan ang-adalan na. Ket ha natipon layna, nakapno hila po nin labinloway bahkit. (Luke 9:17b)
