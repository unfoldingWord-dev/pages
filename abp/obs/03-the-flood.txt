====== 3. The Flood ======

{{:en:obs:obs-03-01.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

Many years later, many people were living in the world. They had become very wicked and violent. It became so bad that God decided to destroy the whole world with a huge flood.

Kananyatew a panaon, malabong anan tataon anti ihtibay ha babe lota. Hiyay Apo Dioh, nakit na hilay kaganaan a tatao a ahe anan ampanyag nin kangedan ta pawa anan kalok-an ye andiagen la.

But Noah found grace in God’s eyes. He was the only righteous man among all the wicked people. God told Noah about the flood He was planning to send. He told Noah to build a huge boat called an ark.

Homain anan kanayon a ampanggalang kanan Apo Dioh no aliwan hiyay Nowin bengat. Hiyay Nowi, ampanopad ya kanan Apo Dioh boy angkalimo yan manyag maloke ta ampanggalang ya kanan Apo Dioh. Tatlo hilay lālaki a aanak nan Nowi. Hiyay ngalan la: Sem, Cam, boy Jafet.  
Haanin, hiyay Apo Dioh, inhabi na kanan Nowi, a wana, “Hilay tatao haanin, maloke hilayna. Kaya-bay lanaben koy babe lota ta omon hilaynan matey.”

God told Noah to make the boat about 140 meters long, 23 meters wide, and 13.5 meters high. It was to be made of wood and have three levels, many rooms, a roof, and a window. The boat would keep Noah, his family, and two of every kind of animal safe during the flood.

“Noba bayo ko lanaben ye babe lota, manyag ka po nin mayadet a bangka a hakyan yo a ahe mahlepan nin lanom. Hiyay bangka a diagen mo, apat a gatoh boy limampo a mitodo ti kaway na.

Noah obeyed God. He and his three sons built the boat just the way God had told them. It took many years to build the boat, because it was so big. Noah warned the people about the coming flood and told them to turn to God, but they just laughed at him.

Pahakayen moy ahawa mo boy tatloy aanak mo boy aahawa la ta omon kawo mayligtah.”

Noah and his family also gathered enough food for themselves and the animals. When everything was ready, God told Noah it was time for him, his wife, his three sons, and their wives to get into the boat—eight people in all.

Ha nayadi anay bangka, hinabi nin Apo Dioh kanan Nowi, a wana, “Homakay kawoyna ha bangka,” wana.

God sent a male and a female of every animal and bird to Noah so they could go into the boat and be kept safe during the flood. God sent seven males and seven females of every type of animal which could be used for sacrifices. When they were all in the boat, God Himself closed the door.

“Ha kaganaan a kalahin aayop, mangwa kan maghay padih ta ihakay mo hila ha bangka, noba pitoy padih ye kowen mo ha kaganaan a kalahin aayop a malyadin mon maydigalo kangko. Mangikalga kawon malabong a pamamangan yo boy pamamangan lan hilain a aayop.”

Then it began to rain, and rain, and rain. It rained for forty days and forty nights without stopping! Water also came gushing up out of the earth. Everything in the whole world was covered with water, even the highest mountains.

Haanin, ha nakahakay hilayna, hiyay polta nin yabaytew a bangka, inleneb na yan Apo Dioh. Pagkayadi yatew, nangodan yaynan nang-odan, mangaamot boy madeglem angga ha maabot ye apatapo a mangaamot.

Everything that lived on the dry land died, except the people and animals who were in the boat. The boat floated on the water and everything inside the boat was kept safe.

Hiyay babe lota, natagpenan nin lanom. Ket hilay mangapapantay, ahe anan makit. Naoboh anan natey ye kaganaan a tataon ahe namteg kanan Apo Dioh. Ket hilay angkabi-ay bengat, hilan Nowi boy hilatew a aayop a anti ihtew ha bangka.

{{:en:obs:obs-03-09.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

After the rains stopped, the boat floated on the water for five months, and then one day the boat rested on the top of a mountain. But the world was still covered with water. After three more months, the tops of the mountains were visible.

Ha loob nin anem a boan, hiyay babe lota, natagpenan nin lanom. Haanin, hiyay Apo Dioh, namaangin yan makhaw ta omon ya omababe ye lanom. Ha naabot yay ikapiton boan, hiyay bangka a anhakyan nan Nowi, nitanghad ya ha mabakil a pinanangalanan Mapantay nan Ararat.

{{:en:obs:obs-03-10.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

After forty more days, Noah sent out a bird called a raven to see if the water had dried up. The raven flew back and forth looking for dry land, but it could not find any.

Ha nalabah ye ikamapo a boan, nakit laynay mabakil. Ket hiyay dinyag nan Nowi, pinalpad na ya ye maghay owak, noba ahe yaynan nag-odong.

{{:en:obs:obs-03-11.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

Later Noah sent out a bird called a dove. But it also could not find any dry land, so it came back to Noah. A week later he sent the dove out again, and it came back with an olive branch in its beak! The water was going down, and the plants were growing again!

Haanin, intobol na ya ye maghay kalapati. Hiyay kalapati, tampol yan nag-odong ta homain ya po mahagpaan boy homain ya po maaponan ta pawa po lanom ye babe lota.

{{:en:obs:obs-03-12.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

Noah waited another week and sent out the dove a third time. This time, it did not come back. The water had dried up!

Pagkalabah anan pitoy mangaamot, intobol na yan oman ye kalapati. Tampol yan nag-odong a ampangaget boong kayo. Pangayadi anan pitoy mangaamot, intobol na yayna man yatew a kalapati, noba hiyay kalapati, ahe yaynan nag-odong.

Two months later God said to Noah, “You and your family and all the animals may leave the boat now. Have many children and grandchildren and fill the earth.” So they obeyed and left the boat.

Haanin, nakit nan Nowi a hiyay babe lota, namal-an ana. Hinabi nin Apo Dioh kanan Nowi, a wana, “Omalih kawoyna ha loob bangka.”

{{:en:obs:obs-03-14.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

After he got off the boat, Noah built an altar and sacrificed some of each kind of animal which could be used for a sacrifice. God was happy with the sacrifice and blessed Noah and his family.

Ket hilan Nowi, lomombah hilayna ha bangka palakew ha lota. Hiyay ona lan dinyag, nagpahalamt hila kanan Apo Dioh ha pangiligtah na kanla. Namatey hilan maghay topa ket in-olam la ya bilang pamahalamat la kanan Apo Dioh ta in-ligtah na hila.

{{:en:obs:obs-03-15.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

God said, “I will never again curse the ground because of humans or destroy the world with a flood, even though humans are sinful from their youth.”

Haanin, hinabi nin Apo Dioh kanla, a wana, “Hiyay babe lota, ahe koynan omanen lanaben.

{{:en:obs:obs-03-16.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

God then made the first rainbow as a sign of His promise. Every time the rainbow appeared in the sky, God would remember what He promised and so would His people.

Manyag akon bowakaw a pagkakitan kanlan tatao a hiyay babe lota, ahe koynan omanen lanaben.”

//A Bible story from: Genesis 6-8//

**Tema: Kalok-an nin tatao**

**Tetepet:**

1) Hinyay maadal tawo tongkol kanan Satanas ha dinyag nin bikat?

2) Hinya hilay pang-oyoy nin Satanas kantawo haanin?

3) Way-omen tawo labanan ye pang-oyoy nin Satanas kantawo?

**Tongkol kanan Apo Jesus:**
Hika boy hiyay babae ket mapayaway kawo. Hiyay lahi mo, boy lahi na,
lanang hilan mapaylaban. Hiyay lahi na (Jesus) ye mamitpit ha ō mo,
ket hika ye manoka ha bitih na. (Genesis 3:15)
