One day, Jesus took three of his disciples, Peter, James, and John with him. (This John was not the same person who baptized Jesus.) They went up on a high mountain by themselves.

Hiyay Apo Jesus, ket hinagyat na hilan Pedro, Juan, boy hiyay Santiago a mānombong na a makew ha matondol. Ta makigwang ya ihtew.  (Luke 9:28)

All of a sudden, Jesus’ face became as bright as the sun and his clothes became as white as light, whiter than anyone on earth could make them.

Haanin, ha ampakigwang yay Apo Jesus, ket naoman ye kadih na boy hiyay bado na, ket angkominlab ha tobat a kapotian. (Luke 9:29)

Then Moses and Elijah, who had both lived hundreds of years earlier, appeared. They talked with Jesus about his death which would soon happen in Jerusalem.

Kapipikhaan, main anan loway lāki a ampakihabi kanan Apo Jesus. Ket hilayatin loway lāki, ket hiyay Moises boy hiyay Elias a propitan māngihabin Habi nin Dioh ha hatew.  Main hilan kahnagan nan Apo Dioh. Ket hinabi la kana, a wanla, “Madanon anan panaon a mignap ye kalabayan nan Apo Dioh a matey ka ha banwan Jerusalem.” (Luke 9:30-31)

As Moses and Elijah were talking with Jesus, Peter said, “Jesus, it is good for us to be here. Let us make three tents, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.” Peter did not know what he was saying.

Hiyay Pedro boy hilay kalalamoan na, ket maiplek ye katoloy la, noba tampol hilan nakaimokat. Ket nakit lay kahnagan nan Apo Jesus boy nakit la hila met ye Moises boy Elias a kalamo nan ampideng. Haanin, an-omalih yaynay Moises boy Elias ha talig nan Apo Jesus. Ket hiyay Pedro, hinabi na kanan Apo Jesus, a wana, “Maihtodo, mamanged po no komonin kitawoyna ihti. Manyag kayin tatloy hongab. Hiyay magha, kammo. Hiyay magha, kanan Moises. Ket hiyay magha, kanan Elias.” Hinabi na yatew, ta naigat ya. (Luke 9:32-33)

As Peter was talking, a bright cloud came down on top of them and a voice from the cloud said, “This is My Son whom I love. I am pleased with him. Listen to him.” The three disciples were terrified and fell on the ground.

Ket ha ampaghabi ya po ye Pedro, main owep a inomaypa a nangamey kanla. Ket tampol hilan naplak ha owep ye Moises boy Elias. Hilay mānombong na, ha nakit la yati, nahindakan hilan tobat. 
Haanin, main tonoy a ampangibat ha owep a ampaghabi, a wana, “Yati ye mamaghay Anak kon pinili ko. Hombongen yoy iadal na.” (Luke 9:34-35)

Then Jesus touched them and said, “Do not be afraid. Get up.” When they looked around they saw no one but Jesus. 

Ha nange lan mānombong na ye tonoy, nalimwan hilan tobat. Ket' nilomokob hila ha lota. Ha panlomokob la, hinomaley yay Apo Jesus kanla, ta dina-dapikpik na hila. Ket hinabi na kanla a, “Mideng kawo! Adi kawo angkalimo.” Ha nideng hilayna, homain hilan nakit a kanayon, no aliwan hiyay Apo Jesus bengat. (Matt 17:6-8)

As they went back down the mountain, Jesus said, “Do not tell anyone about what happened here until after I have been raised from the dead.”

Ha tinomgen ye tonoy, nakit laynan ang-adalan a bobokod naynan Apo Jesus. Ket yatin nalyadi a nakit la, ket ahe la po imbalita nin ang-adalan ha agya hinyaman. (Luke 9:36)
