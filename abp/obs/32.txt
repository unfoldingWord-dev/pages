One day, Jesus and his disciples crossed the Sea of Galilee to the country of the Gerasenes.

Haanin, hiyay Apo Jesus boy hilay mānombong na a anlomogan ha bangka, ket niabot hilayna ha logal lan tataon anhabtan Geraseno, ha lipay dagat, ha eteb nin plobinhyan Galilea. (Luke 8:26)

When they reached the other side, a man with an evil spirit came running up to Jesus.

Ha nakalombah yaynay Apo Jesus ha bangka, hinagana yan maghay lākin ibat ha banwa. Yatew a lāki, lanang yan ampaengewen nin maloke a ihpidito. (Luke 8:27a)

This man was so strong that nobody could hold him down. People had even used chains to lock him up, but he kept breaking them.
Agya ikolong la ya boy balolen lay gagamet na boy bibitih na nin tanikala, ket angkaboyto na. Ta an-ipalakew na yan maloke a ihpidito ha logal a homain tao. (Luke 8:28-29a)

He lived among the tombs in the area. Day and night this man would scream. He wore no clothes and cut himself repeatedly with stones.

Naboyot anan panaon a loh-ok ya boy paibat ha pinaengew na yan mangaloke a ihpidito, ahe yayna angkomonin ha baey. Ta pangokomonin naynan bengat ha bito. (Luke 8:27b)

When the man came to Jesus, he fell on his knees in front of him. Jesus said, “Come out of the man, you evil spirit!”

Hinabi nan Apo Jesus kana, a wana, “Maloke a ihpidito, omalih kayna ihen!” (Luke 8:28-29b)

{{:en:obs:obs-32-06.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

The man with the evil spirit cried out in a loud voice and said, “What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? Please do not torture me!” Then Jesus asked the man, “What is your name?” He replied, “My name is Legion, for we are many.” (A legion was a group of up to 6,000 soldiers.)

Haanin, ha nange nan lāki ye hinabi nan Apo Jesus, nangha ya boy linomokob ya ha adapan na. Ket angkomolih yan ampaghabi, a wana, “Jesus, tanda ko a hika ye Anak nan Pinakamakapalyadiyan a Dioh. Ahe mo ko dayi ampakibalabalaan a paidapan!” 
Haanin, hiyay Apo Jesus, tinepet na yay lāki, a wana, “Hinyay ngalan mo?” 
Hinabi nan lāki, a wana, “Hiyay ngalan ko, ket ‘Kawan’.” Wanabay ye inhebat na. Ta malabong a maloke a ihpidito ye anti kana. (Luke 8:28-29c-30)

The evil spirits begged Jesus, “Please do not send us out of this area!” There was a herd of pigs feeding on a nearby hill. So, the evil spirits begged Jesus, “Please send us into the pigs instead!” Jesus said, “Go!”

Hilay maloke a ihpidito, ket in-awok la kanan Apo Jesus, a wanla, “Ahe mo kayi dayi an-ipalakew ha maalale a logal a pamadohaan! No aliwan palobohan mo kayi dayin makew ha kawan a bababoy a anti ha aling nin matondol a ampambok.” 
Ket hinabi nan Apo Jesus, a wana, “Hige, makew kawoyna!” (Luke 8:31-32)

{{:en:obs:obs-32-08.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

The evil spirits came out of the man and entered the pigs. The pigs ran down a steep bank into the sea and drowned. There were about 2,000 pigs in the herd.

Kaya-bay, inomalih hilay maloke a ihpidito kanan lāki, ta nakew hila kanlan bababoy. Haanin, hilay bababoy, oli kanlan maloke a ihpidito a anti kanla, ket nipapayew hilan nipataboy ha bengaw. Ta ihtew hilaynan nangamatey. (Luke 8:33)

{{:en:obs:obs-32-09.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

When the people taking care of the pigs saw what happened, they ran and told everyone what Jesus had done. All the people came from the town and saw the man who used to have the evil spirits. He was sitting down, wearing clothes, and acting like a normal person.

Hilay ampanayhay nin bababoy, ha nakit lay nalyadi, ket nipapayew hilan nakew ha banwa boy ha babadyo. Ta an-ibalita lay tongkol ha nalyadi. Kaya-bay hilay tataon nakange, nakew hila, ta bilewen la. Ha niabot hilayna kanan Apo Jesus, hiyay lākin pinaengew nin maloke a ihpidito, ket nakit la yan ampikno ha haley bitih nan Apo Jesus a nakabadoyna boy matinoꞌ anay kaihipan na. (Luke 8:34-35a)

{{:en:obs:obs-32-10.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

The people were very afraid and asked Jesus to leave. So Jesus got into the boat and prepared to leave. The man who had been healed begged to go along with Jesus.

Haanin, hilay tatao, oli ha nakit la, ket nalimwan hila.  Ket hilay tataon taga ihtew ha Geraseno, nakihabi hila kanan Apo Jesus, a wanla, “Omalih ka ihti ha logal mi. Ta angkalimo kayiynan tobat kammo.” 
Kaya-bay hiyay Apo Jesus, linomogan ya ha bangka, ta nag-odong yayna ha logal a ibatan na. Hiyay lākin inalihan nin maloke a ihpidito, ket nakiiingalo yan makilakew kanan Apo Jesus. (Luke 8:35b, 37-38)


{{:en:obs:obs-32-11.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

But Jesus said to him, “Go home and tell your friends and family how much God has done for you and how He has had mercy on you.”

Noba ahe na ya pinalobohan no aliwan, pinaoli na yayna, ta hinabi na, a wana, “Moli kayna ha angkonaan yo. Ta yatin nalyadi a dinyag nan Apo Dioh kammo, ibalita mo kanlan tatao.” (Luke 8:38b-39a)

{{:en:obs:obs-32-12.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

So the man went away and told everyone about what Jesus had done for him. Everyone who heard his story was filled with wonder and amazement.

Haanin, noli yaynay lāki. Ket hiyay lāki, tinopad nan imbalita kanlan kaganaan a tatao kananyatew a banwa ye dinyag nan Apo Jesus kana. (Luke 8:39b)

{{:en:obs:obs-32-13.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

Jesus returned to the other side of the Sea of Galilee. A large crowd gathered around him and pressed in on him. In the crowd was a woman who had been bleeding for twelve years. She had spent all her money on doctors trying to get better, but she only got worse.

Ha nag-odong yay Apo Jesus ha lipay dagat, ket linomigha hilay kaganaan a tatao. Ta ampangagad hila kana.  Haanin, main met maghan babayi kanlan kalabongan. Ket pandodomaya nayna bengat ha loob nin labinloway taon. Kaganaan a kabandian na, ket naoboh naynan imbayad kanlan nanambal kana. Noba homain bega nakapaitaah kana, agya maghay mānambal. (Luke 8:40,43)

{{:en:obs:obs-32-14.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

She heard how Jesus had healed many sick people and thought to herself, “If I only touch Jesus’ clothes, then I, too, will be healed!” She came up behind Jesus and touched his clothes. As soon as she touched Jesus, the bleeding stopped!

Ket haanin, nakew ya ha golotan nan Apo Jesus, ta kiniwit nay laylay nin tapih nan Apo Jesus. Ket kapipikhaan, tinomgen anay pantomolo nin daya na. (Luke 8:44)


{{:en:obs:obs-32-15.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

Immediately Jesus realized that power had gone out from him. So he turned around and asked, “Who touched me?” The disciples replied, “Jesus, there are many people crowding around you and bumping into you. How can you ask, ‘Who touched me?’”

Ket haanin, nanepet yay Apo Jesus, a wana, “Hinyay nangiwit kangko?” 
Noba nakibat ye balang magha kanla, a wanla, “Aliwan hiko!” 
Kaya-bay naghabi yay Pedro, a wana, “Apo, tanda mon malabong hilay tataon ampaypopoit kanyo.” (Luke 8:45)

{{:en:obs:obs-32-16.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

The woman fell on her knees before Jesus, shaking and very afraid. Then she told the whole truth. Jesus said to her, “Your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be healed of your sickness.”

Noba hinabi nan Apo Jesus kanan Pedro, a wana, “Main nangiwit kangko. Ta natanam kon main kapalyadiyan a linomwah kangko.” Haanin, ha natandaan nan babayi a homain malyadin itayo kanan Apo Jesus, ampamigpig yan nilomokob ha haley adapan nan Apo Jesus. Kaya-bay hinabi na ha adapan lan kaganaan a tatao ye pangiwit na kanan Apo Jesus boy no way-omon yan tampol nitaah. 
Haanin, hinabi nan Apo Jesus kanan babayi, a wana, “Inang, hiyay pamteg mo ye nakapaitaah kammo. Moli kaynan main katanaan.” (Luke 8:46-48)
