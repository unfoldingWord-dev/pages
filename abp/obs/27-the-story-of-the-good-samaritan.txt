One day, a lawyer came to Jesus to test him, saying, “Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?” Jesus answered, “What is written in God’s law?”

Haanin, main maghay maihtodo nin bibilin a nideng ta omon na ya hoboken ye Apo Jesus, a wana, “Maihtodo, hinyay katapolan kon diyagen ta omon ako magkamain nin bi-ay a homain anggaan?” Nakibat yay Apo Jesus kana, a wana, “Hinyay nakaholat ha bibilin? Hinyay angkabaha mo ihtew?” (10:25-26)

“Love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, strength, and mind. And love your neighbor as yourself,” the lawyer said. Jesus answered, “You are correct! Do this and you will live.”

Nakibat yay tao, a wana, “Hiyay angkakit ko, hiyay Apo mon Dioh, ket adoen mo yan loboh ha poho mo, loboh ha kalelewa mo, loboh ha kak-hawan mo boy loboh ha pangihip mo. Ket adoen moy kapadiho mon tao a omon ha hadili mo.” Hinabi nan Apo Jesus kana, a wana, “Hohto ye pakibat mo. Kaya-bay wanabay ye diyagen mo ta omon ka magkamain nin bi-ay a homain anggaan.”  (10:27-28)

But the lawyer wanted to prove that he was right, so he asked, “Who is my neighbor?”

Noba hiyay tao, ket ahe na labay a mipading-ey ya. Kaya-bay tinepet na yay Apo Jesus, a wana, “Hinya nayi ye kapadiho kon tao?” (10:29)

Jesus answered with a story. “There was a Jewish man who was traveling along the road from Jerusalem to Jericho.” 

Nakibat yay Apo Jesus kana makaoli ha maghay alimbawa, a wana, “Main maghay taon ibat ha banwan Jerusalem a ampakew ha banwan Jerico. (10:30a)

“While he was traveling, he was attacked by a group of robbers. They took everything he had and beat him until he was almost dead. Then they went away.”

Ket nakahagana yan tataon totolihan. Niloh-okan la ya, ta kingwa lay bado na boy pilak na haka la ya pinagbobogbog angga ha angkakamatey yayna haka la ya inalihan ha gilid kalhada.  (10:30b)

“Soon after that, a Jewish priest happened to walk down that same road. When this religious leader saw the man who had been robbed and beaten, he moved to the other side of the road, ignored the man in need, and kept on going.”

Haanin, main met padi a nipadān ihtew. Ha nakit na yay lākin nabogbog, niliklikan na ya. (10:31)

“Not long after that, a Levite came down the road. (Levites were a tribe of Jews who helped the priests at the Temple.) The Levite also crossed over to the other side of the road and ignored the man who had been robbed and beaten.”

Main ana man nipadān ihtew a maghay lākin Levita, a lahi nan Levi.c Ket ha niabot ya ihtew, nakit na yay lākin nabogbog. Noba niliklikan na ya met ateed, ta nagpaholong ya ha pangomodang na.  (10:32)

“The next person to walk down that road was a Samaritan. (Samaritans were the descendants of Jews and people from other nations. Samaritans and Jews hated each other.) When the Samaritan saw the man, he was filled with compassion. He cared for him and bandaged his wounds.”

Haanin, main maghay Samaritano a nakadān ihtew. Ket ha nakit na yay lākin nabogbog, in-ingalowan na ya. Hinaleyan na ya, ta hiyay hogat na, ket tiniihan nan ladak boy alak haka na pinteh. (10:33-34a)

“The Samaritan then lifted the man onto his own donkey and took him to a hotel where he took care of him.”

Haanin, inhakay na ya ha kabayo na, ta inlakew na yayna ha baey a an-opaan. Ta ihtewbay na ya hinayhay.  (10:34b)

“The next day, the Samaritan needed to continue his journey. He gave the person in charge of the hotel some money and said, ‘Take care of him, and if any extra money is spent, I will repay those expenses when I return.’”

Kabekahan, hiyay Samaritano, ket binyan na yan pilak ye nagbaey boy hinabi na kana, a wana, ‘Hayhayen mo yan manged. Ket no magkolang man ye imbayad ko kammo, bayadan ko lano ha pag-odong ko.’ ” (10:35)

Then Jesus asked the lawyer, “Which one of the three men do you think was a neighbor to the man who was robbed and beaten?” The lawyer replied, “The one who showed mercy.” Jesus told the lawyer, “You go and do the same thing.”
Haanin, nanepet yay Apo Jesus kanan maihtodo nin bibilin, a wana, “Hinya lagi kanlan hilatin tatlo ye main pagmahakit ha kapadiho nan taon binogbog lan totolihan?” 
Nakibat yay maihtodo nin bibilin, a wana, “Hiyay nangingalo kana.” 
Hinabi nan Apo Jesus kana, a wana, “Kokayna awod. Ta wanabay met ateed ye diyagen mo.” (10:36-37)
