Saul was the first king of Israel. He was tall and handsome, just like the people wanted. Saul did well at first, but he became a wicked man who did not obey God, so God chose a different man to be king in his place.

Hinabi lan Israelita kanan Apo Dioh, <<Hiyay poon a ibyay mo kammi, ket katapolan a matagay ya boy manged yan lāki>>, wanlan Israelita. Haanin, main maghay lāki a nagngalan Saulo. Matagay ya boy manged yan lāki. Kaya-bay hiya ye pinili nan Apo Dioh a ihagili na a pagpoon lan Israelita. Hiyay Saulo a poon la, ha babayon yan nikno a manakop kanla, manged ye andyagen na, noba ha naboboyot yayna, nag-ilyadi yan maloke boy ahe yayna nanombong kanan Apo Dioh. Kaya-bay oli ha kalok-an a dinyag nan Saulo, namili yayna man ye Apo Dioh nin kahagili na a mamoon kanlan Israelita.

BT - The Israelites spoke to Apo God, <<The ruler you will-give to-us(excl), he must be tall and a good [looking] man>>, said the Israelites. Now, there is a man named Saulo. He is tall and he is good [looking] man. So he is the one Apo God chose whom he will-replace being-ruler of the Israelites. Saulo who is their ruler, when he newly sat to have-jurisdiction over-them, good is what he is-doing, but when long-time already, he became evil and he did- not now -follow/obey Apo God. Therefore because of the evil which Saulo did, Apo God chose his replacement to ruler the Israelites.

This man’s name was David. He was a shepherd. While watching the sheep, David had killed both a lion and a bear which had attacked the sheep. David was also a humble and righteous man who trusted and obeyed God.

Ket hiyay David ye pinili nan Apo Dioh a kahagiliyan nan Saulo a mamoon kanla noba ahe ya po malyadin mikno a mamoon. Hiyay David, magha yan pahtol nin aayop. Noba bayo ya namoon kanlan Israelita, wanae ye nalyadi. Legan ampagpahtol yan topa, nakit na hilay mangatobag a ayop a mandoyong kanlan topa na. Ket hiyay dinyag nan David, pinatey na hilay mangatobag a aayop ta main yan kakpehan. Noba hiyay David, magmakaaypa ya, matoynong, boy ampamteg ya kanan Apo Dioh.

BT - And David is the one Apo God chose as the replacement of Saulo who will-rule them but he still can not sit to rule. David, he is a pastor/shepherd of animals. But before he ruled the Israelites, like-this is what happened. While he is-pastoring/shepherding the sheep, he saw wild animals attacking his sheep. And what David did, he killed the wild animals for he has perseverance/courage. But David, he is humble, righteous, and he is-believing Apo God.

David was also a great soldier and leader. When David was still a young man, he fought against a giant named Goliath. Goliath was a trained soldier, very strong, and almost three meters tall! But God helped David kill Goliath and save Israel.


Ha bayontawo yay David, ket kalaban yan Israelita ye Goliat. Hiyay Goliat, kaginta a lāki boy magha yan hondaloh a magaling, makpeh boy mak-haw ya. Hiyay katagayan na, maigit 3 mitodo! Ket agya kotiti yay David, linabanan na yay Goliat. Noba hinaglapan na yan Apo Dioh ye David a mamatey kanan Goliat. Kaya-bay nailigtah hilay Israelita kanlan kalaban la. 

BT - When David is young-man, Goliat is the enemy of the Israelites. Goliat, [is] a large man and he is a soldier who is skilled, brave/persevering and strong. His height, greater than 3 meters! And even-though David is very-small, he fought-against Goliat. But Apo God helped David to kill Goliat. Therefore the Israelites were-saved from their enemies.

Saul became jealous of David and tried many times to kill him. One day Saul was looking for David so he could kill him. Saul went into the same cave where David was hiding. Instead of killing Saul, David cut off a piece of his clothes to prove to Saul that he would not kill him to become king.

Hiyay Poon Saulo, tobat ye imon na kanan David boy nikaano na yaynan pihahapda a pateyen ye David. Ha maghay mangaamot, nakew yan nanoday ye Saulo ha ampagtayoan nan David. Noba hiyay Saulo, ahe na ya angkakit ye David. Hiyay David, angkakit na yay Saulo, ket malyadi na yayna dayin pateyen, noba ahe na dinapat no aliwan gininit naynan bengat ye bado. Ta ahe na labay a makaoli ha pamatey na, ket mag-ilyadi yan poon.   

BT - Ruler Saulo, great is his envy to David and many [times] he is-planning/scheming to kill David. One day, Saulo went to urinate at the hiding-place of David. But Saulo, he did not see David. David, he is-seeing Saulo, and can (desire particle) kill him, but he did not do it but rather just tore-off only his clothes. For he did not want that because of his killing, he will-become ruler.

Eventually, Saul died in battle, and David became king of Israel. He was a good king, and the people loved him. God blessed David and made him successful. David fought many battles and God gave him victory. David conquered Jerusalem and made it his capital. During David’s reign, Israel became powerful and wealthy.

Ha naboboyot makandi, natey yay Saulo ha maghay labanan. Haanin, malyadi yaynan mikno ye David a poon lan Israel. Manged yan pagpoon boy kalabaylabay la yan tatao. Hiyay David, in-inged na yan Apo Dioh. Kaya-bay nikalabong yan nanambot ha labanan. Ha nanakop ya ha banwan Jerusalem, linamoan na yan Apo Dioh. Kaya-bay hiyay banwan Jerusalem ye nag-ilyadin capitulyo nin Israel. Ha panaon a pamoon nan David, ket nag-ilyadin makapalyadiyan boy mabandi ye matiboen logal a Israel.

David wanted to build a temple where everybody could worship God and offer Him sacrifices. For about 400 years, the people had been worshiping God and offering sacrifices to Him at the Tent of Meeting that Moses had built.

Hiyay dinyag nan Moises a tabirnakolo ye ampaytiponan lan manggalang ha loob nin 400 a taon. Noba hiyay Poon David, labay na met ye mangipaideng nin Templo a panggalangan kanan Apo Dioh ta omen hila met main nin panggalangan boy main pangidigalowan kanan Apo Dioh.

God sent the prophet Nathan to David with this message, “Because you are a man of war, you will not build Me this house; your son will. But, I will bless you greatly. Someone from your family will always sit on the throne of Israel. And the Messiah will be one of your descendants!” The Messiah is God’s Chosen One who would save the world from sin.


Noba intobol na yan Apo Dioh ye propetan Natan a makew kanan Poon David. Hinabi nan Natan kanan David, a wana, <<Wanae ye hinabi nan Apo Dioh kangko a habiyen ko kammo. Oli ta matobag ka ha labanan, aliwan hikay malyadin manyag baey nan Apo Dioh, no aliwan hiyay anak mo. Noba agya wanabay man, inged na kan teed nin Apo Dioh. Boy aliwa po bengat yain, ta hiyay lahi mo, hilabay bengat ye mikno ha pamiknoan nin poon lan Israelita. Boy maibat ha lahi mo ye lomateng a Māngiligtah!>>


{{:en:obs:obs-17-08.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


When David heard these words, he immediately thanked and praised God because He had promised David great honor and many blessings. The Israelites would have to wait a long time before the Messiah came, almost 1,000 years.


Ha nange nan David ye hinabi nan Natan, tampol yan nagpahalamat boy nanggalang kanan Apo Dioh oli ta impangako nan Apo Dioh kana a biyan na yan kangedan. Noba hilay Israelita, mangagad hila po nin malibon taon bayo ya lomateng kanla ye Māngiligtah la.

David ruled with justice and faithfulness for many years, and God blessed him. However, toward the end of his life he sinned terribly before God.

Manged ye pamoon nan David ha Israel. Matoynong ya boy in-inged na yan Apo Dioh. Agya wanabay, ha kapopohan nin bi-ay na, nakadiyag yan mabyat a kahalanan ha adapan nan Apo Dioh.

One day, when all of his soldiers were out fighting, David got up from an afternoon nap and saw a beautiful woman bathing. Her name was Bathsheba.

Maghay mahilem, legan anlomaban hilay hohondaloh na, angkatoloy yay David ha baey na. Ha nimata ya, nakit nay ampalyo ye Batseba a maada a babayi.


{{:en:obs:obs-17-11.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Instead of looking away, David sent someone to bring her to him. He slept with her and sent her back home. A short time later Bathsheba sent a message to David saying that she was pregnant.


Tanatana talingkokolan na ya dayi ye babayi, nagkamalih impakwa na ya. Ket ha inlateng la yay babayi, tinakeh na ya. Ha pamigantah na yan tinakeh, pinaoli na yayna. Ha ahe maboyot, imbalita nan Batseba kanan David, a wana, <<Pinaboktot moko. Ket hikay bapa nan anak ko.>> 


{{:en:obs:obs-17-12.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Her husband, Uriah, was one of David’s best soldiers. David called Uriah back from the battle and told him to go be with his wife. But Uriah refused to go home while the rest of the soldiers were in battle. So David sent Uriah back to the battle and had him placed where the enemy was strongest so that he would be killed.


Hiyay Batseba, main yan ahawa a magha kanlan magaling a hondaloh nan Poon David. Hiyay ngalan na ket Urias. Hinagyat na yan David ye Urias a omalih ya ha labanan ta mag-odong ya ha Israel. Ha linomateng yayna kanan Poon David, hinabi nan David kana, <<Moli kayna ha baey mo, ta id-an mo ya po ye ahawa mo.>> Hinabi nan David yati ta omen na ahe mabaan nin Urias a tinakeh na yan David ye ahawa na. 
Noba hiyay Urias, ahe na labay ye mida ta an-ihipen nay kaidapan nin kalalamoan na a anlomaban. Kaya-bay hiyay David, hinolatan na yay opihyal nan Urias. Ket wanae ye nakaholat, “Ipadongla mo yay Urias ha labanan ta omon yan matey.” Ket hiyay opihyal, tinopad nay inholat nan David. Kaya-bay natey yay Urias ha labanan, agya po magaling ya.



{{:en:obs:obs-17-13.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


After Uriah was killed, David married Bathsheba. Later, she gave birth to a son. God was not pleased with what David had done, so He sent the prophet Nathan to show David his sin. David repented of his sin and God forgave him. For the rest of his life, David trusted God, even in difficult times.


Ha natey yay Urias, hiyay dinyag nan Poon David, linood na yan inahawa ye Batseba. Ha paylamo la, inlomateng ye panaon a in-anak nay maghay ongi a lāki. Ket yatin dinyag nan David, napoot yay Apo Dioh. Kaya-bay intobol na yayna man ye propetan Natan kanan David, a wana, <<David, nagkahalanan ka kanan Apo Dioh.>> Ha nange nan David ye hinabi nan Nathan, naghehe ya, ket pinatawad na ya met nin Apo Dioh. Paibat kananyatew, agya malabong ye kaidapan a angkadihaan na, namteg ya met ateed kanan Apo Dioh.

But as punishment for his sin, David’s baby boy died. There was also fighting in David’s family for the rest of his life, and David’s power was greatly weakened. Though David had been unfaithful to God, God was still faithful to His promises. Bathsheba gave birth to another son named Solomon.

Noba hiyay padoha a nadihaan na, natey yay anak nan David kanan Batseba boy naagwat ana met ye kapah-eyan nin pamoon na. Agya po man nakadyag yan kahalanan ha pamilew nan Apo Dioh, ket mapah-ey po ateed ye pangako nan Apo Dioh kana. Haanin, nagkaanak yan oman ye David kanan Batseba nin maghay lāki a pinangalanan lan Solomon.
