Saul was the first king of Israel. He was tall and handsome, just like the people wanted. Saul did well at first, but he became a wicked man who did not obey God, so God chose a different man to be king in his place.

Hinabi lan Israelita kanan Apo Dioh, <<Hiyay poon a ibyay mo kammi, ket katapolan a matagay yan manged a laki>>, wanlan Israelita. Haanin, main maghay laki a nagngalan Saulo. Matagay yan manged a laki. Kaya-bay hiya ye pinili nan Apo Dioh a pagpoon lan Israelita. Ta wanabay ye labay la. Hiyay Saulo a poon la, ha babayon yan nikno a manakop kanla, manged ye andyagen na, noba ha naboboyot yayna, nag-ilyadi yan maloke boy ahe yayna nanombong kanan Apo Dioh. Kaya-bay namili yayna man ye Apo Dioh nin kahagili na a mamoon kanlan Israelita.

This man’s name was David. He was a shepherd. While watching the sheep, David had killed both a lion and a bear which had attacked the sheep. David was also a humble and righteous man who trusted and obeyed God.

Ket hiyay David ye pinili nan Apo Dioh a mamoon kanla. Hiyay David, magha yan pahtol nin aayop. Noba bayo ya namoon kanlan Israelita, wanae ye nalyadi. Legan ampagpahtol yan topa, nakit na hilay matobag a ayop a manduyung kanlan topa na. Ket hiyay dinyag nan David, pinatey na hilay mangatobag a ayop ta main yan kakpehan. Noba hiyay David, magmakaaypa ya, matoynong, boy māmteg kanan Apo Dioh.

David was also a great soldier and leader. When David was still a young man, he fought against a giant named Goliath. Goliath was a trained soldier, very strong, and almost three meters tall! But God helped David kill Goliath and save Israel.


Hiyay David, magaling yan hondaloh boy poon. Ha bayontawo yay David, kalaban yan Israelita ye Goliat. Hiyay Goliat, kaginta a lāki, magaling yan hondaloh, makpeh boy mak-haw boy maigit 3 mitodo ye katag-ayan na! Ket hiyay David, linabanan na yay Goliat agya makandi ya. Noba hinaglapan na yan Apo Dioh ye David a mamatey kanan Goliat. Kaya-bay nailigtah hilay Israelita kanan Goliat.

Saul became jealous of David and tried many times to kill him. One day Saul was looking for David so he could kill him. Saul went into the same cave where David was hiding. Instead of killing Saul, David cut off a piece of his clothes to prove to Saul that he would not kill him to become king.

Hiyay Poon Saulo, tobat ye imon na kanan David boy nikaano na yan pihahapda a pateyen na ya. Noba ahe na ya binae nin David. Ha maghay mangaamot, linomoob yay Saul ha koweba a ampagtayoan nan David. Panaon ana yati a malyadin pateyen na yan David ye Saulo. Noba ahe na ya pinatey no aliwan gininit naynan bengat ye laylay nin kepkep nan Saulo a pangipaehan na. Dinyag na yati ta omen paptegan na a ahe na labay a mamatey ta omen ya mag-ilyadin poon.

Eventually, Saul died in battle, and David became king of Israel. He was a good king, and the people loved him. God blessed David and made him successful. David fought many battles and God gave him victory. David conquered Jerusalem and made it his capital. During David’s reign, Israel became powerful and wealthy.

Ha naboyot makandi, natey yay Saulo ha maghay labanan. Ha wanabay, hiyay David ye nag-ilyadin poon ha Israel. Manged yan poon boy kalabaylabay la yan tatao. Hiyay David, in-inged na yan Apo Dioh. Kaya-bay nikalabong yan nanambot ha labanan. Ha nanakop ya ha banwan Jerusalem, linamoan na yan Apo Dioh boy hiyay banwan Jerusalem ye nag-ilyadin capitulyo nin Israel. Ha panaon a pamoon nan David, nag-ilyadin makapalyadiyan boy mabandi ye matiboen nahyon Israel.

David wanted to build a temple where everybody could worship God and offer Him sacrifices. For about 400 years, the people had been worshiping God and offering sacrifices to Him at the Tent of Meeting that Moses had built.

Hiyay hinakdo a dinyag nan Moises ye ampaytiponan lan manggalang ha loob nin 400 a taon. Noba hiyay Poon David, labay na met ye mangipaideng nin Templo a panggalangan kanan Apo Dioh ta omen hila manggalang boy mangidigalo hilan kaganaan a tatao kanan Apo DIoh.

God sent the prophet Nathan to David with this message, “Because you are a man of war, you will not build Me this house; your son will. But, I will bless you greatly. Someone from your family will always sit on the throne of Israel. And the Messiah will be one of your descendants!” The Messiah is God’s Chosen One who would save the world from sin.


Noba intobol na yan Apo Dioh ye propetan Natan kanan David. Hinabi na, a wana, <<Wanae ye an-ipahabi nan Apo Dioh kammo. Oli ta matobag ka ha labanan, aliwan hikay manyag baey ko, no aliwan anak moyna man. Noba agya wanabay man, inged na kan teed nin Apo Dioh. Boy aliwa po bengat yain, ta hiyay lahi mo, pawa hilay mikno ha pamiknoan bilang poon lan Israelita. Boy maibat ha lahi mo ye Māngiligtah a lomateng!>>


{{:en:obs:obs-17-08.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


When David heard these words, he immediately thanked and praised God because He had promised David great honor and many blessings. The Israelites would have to wait a long time before the Messiah came, almost 1,000 years.


Ha nalenge nan David ye hinabi nan Natan, tampol yan nagpahalamat boy nanggalang kanan Apo Dioh oli ta impangako nan Apo Dioh a anti kanay galang boy kangedan. Noba hilay Israelita, mangagad hila po nin 1,000 a taon bayo lomateng ye Māngiligtah.

David ruled with justice and faithfulness for many years, and God blessed him. However, toward the end of his life he sinned terribly before God.

Manged ye pamoon nan David ha Israel. Matoynong ya boy in-inged na yan Apo Dioh. Agya wanabay, ha kapopohan nin bi-ay na, nakadiyag yan mabyat a kahalanan ha adapan nan Apo Dioh.

One day, when all of his soldiers were out fighting, David got up from an afternoon nap and saw a beautiful woman bathing. Her name was Bathsheba.

Maghay mangaamot, legan anlomaban hilay hohondaloh na, angkatoloy yay David ha mahilem. Ha nimata ya, nakit nay matampa a babayi a ampagliyo. Batseba ye ngalan na.


{{:en:obs:obs-17-11.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Instead of looking away, David sent someone to bring her to him. He slept with her and sent her back home. A short time later Bathsheba sent a message to David saying that she was pregnant.


Ket kainghon talingkokolan na ya dayi, nagkamalih nangitobol ya po ingat nin kanayon a nangwa kanan babayi. Ket tinakeh na yay babayi. Ha panigantah na yan tinakeh, pinaoli na yayna. Ha ahe maboyot, imbalita nan Batseba kanan David, a wana, <<Naboktot ako boy hikay bapa.>> 


{{:en:obs:obs-17-12.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Her husband, Uriah, was one of David’s best soldiers. David called Uriah back from the battle and told him to go be with his wife. But Uriah refused to go home while the rest of the soldiers were in battle. So David sent Uriah back to the battle and had him placed where the enemy was strongest so that he would be killed.


Hiyay ahawa nan babayi a naboktot na, ket magha ya kanlan magaling a hondaloh nan David. Hiyay ngalan na ket Urias. Hinagya na yan David a omalih ya ha labanan ta mag-odong ha Israel. Ha linomateng yayna, hinabi nan David kana, <<Moli kayna ta magpakadeglem ka ha ahawa mo.>> Noba hiyay Urias, ahe na labay ta an-ihipen nay kaidapan nin kalalamoan na ihtew ha labanan. Kaya-bay hiyay David, hinolatan na yay opihyal nan Urias. Ket wanae ye nakaholat “Ipadongla mo yay Urias ha adapan nin paylalabanan la ta omon yan matey.” Ket hiyay opihyal, tinopad nay bilin nan David a nakaholat. Kaya-bay natey yay Urias ha labanan agya po magaling ya.



{{:en:obs:obs-17-13.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


After Uriah was killed, David married Bathsheba. Later, she gave birth to a son. God was not pleased with what David had done, so He sent the prophet Nathan to show David his sin. David repented of his sin and God forgave him. For the rest of his life, David trusted God, even in difficult times.


Ha natey yay Urias, hiyay dinyag nan Poon David, inahawa na yay Batseba. Ha paylamo la, inlomateng ye panaon a in-anak nay maghay ongi a lāki. Ha wanabay, napoot yay Apo Dioh ha dinyag nan David. Kaya-bay intobol na yay Natan kanan David, a wana, <<David, nagkahalanan ka kanan Apo Dioh.>> Ha nange nan David ye hinabi nan Nathan, naghehe ya boy pinatawad na ya met nin Apo Dioh ye kahalanan na. Paibat kananyatew, agya malabong ye kaidapan a angkadiha na, namteg ya met ateed kanan Apo Dioh.

But as punishment for his sin, David’s baby boy died. There was also fighting in David’s family for the rest of his life, and David’s power was greatly weakened. Though David had been unfaithful to God, God was still faithful to His promises. Bathsheba gave birth to another son named Solomon.

Noba bilang padoha ha kahalanan na, natey yay anak nan David kanan Batseba boy nadama ye paymamagha nin pamilya na. Ket naalih ana met ye kapah-eyan nin panakop/pamoon na. Agya nakadyag yan kahalanan ha pamilew nan Apo Dioh, wanabay man, pawa mapah-ey ye pangako nan Apo Dioh kana. Haanin, nakaanak ya po ye Batseba nin maghay anak a impangalan lan Sulumun.
