After the Israelites received God’s Covenant at Mount Sinai, God began leading them toward the Promised Land, which was also called Canaan. The cloud pillar showed them the way.

Hilay Israelita, ha natanggap lay kahondoan nan Apo Dioh ihtew ha Mapantay nin Sinai, in-ogot na hilan palakew ha logal a impangako na kanla. Hiyay Apo Dioh a anti ha owep, ket hiya ye nangona kanla.

God had promised Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob that He would give the Promised Land to their descendants, but now there were many tribes of people living there. They were called Canaanites. The Canaanites did not believe in God. They worshiped false gods and did many evil things.

Impangako nan Apo Dioh kanan Abraham, Isaac boy Jacob a byan na hilan logal ye lalahi la. Noba haanin, malabong hilayna met ye tribo a angkomonin ihtew ha logal a impangako nan Apo Dioh kanla. Hilatin tribo ket anhabtan Cananeo. Hilay Cananeo, ahe hila ampamteg kanan Apo Dioh. Ta hiyay ampamtegan la, dioh-diohan a ampanggalangen la.

God told the Israelites, “You must get rid of all the Canaanites in the Promised Land. Do not make peace with them and do not marry them. You must completely destroy all of their idols. If you do not do these things, you will worship their idols instead of Me.”

When the Israelites reached the edge of Canaan, Moses chose twelve men, one from each tribe of Israel. He gave the men instructions to go and spy on the land to see what it was like. They were also to spy on the Canaanites to see if they were strong or weak.

Haanin, hiyay dinapat nan Moises, namili yan labinlowan lālaki a timagha ha balang tribo nin Israel. Ket hinabi na kanla, a wana, “Makew kawo ha logal a Canaan. Ta bilewen yo no malabong hilay tataon mangak-haw o malalabong hilay mangakapey.”

{{:en:obs:obs-14-05.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

The men spied on Canaan for forty days, then they came back. Ten of the spies gave a bad report, saying, “The land is very good, and the crops are great! But the cities are very strong, and the people are giants! If we attack them, we will surely die!”

Ket nanegleng hila ihtew nin apatapo a mangaamot, ta ihtew hila maniem. Ha nag-odong hilayna, hilay mapo kanla, imbalita la, a wanla, “Ihtewbay a logal, ket malabong ye makan. Noba maghen ye babanwa la boy ba’mo kitawon bengat kowangey a naitalig kanla. Ta hilay tataon angkomonin ihtew, ket mangak-haw hila boy mangayadet ye lalaman la. No dawohongen tawo hila, ket mahambot kitawon homain hapo.” 

{{:en:obs:obs-14-06.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

Immediately Caleb and Joshua, the other two spies, said, “It is true that the people of Canaan are tall and strong, but we can certainly defeat them! God will fight for us!”

Noba, hiyay Caleb boy Josue, tampol lan hinabi kanlan kalalamoan la, a wanla, “Peteg a hilay tatao ihtew, ket mangak-haw boy mangayadet hila. Noba homain hapon lowa-lowa a hamboten tawo hila! Ta lamo tawo yay Apo Dioh.”

But the people were mad at Moses and Aaron and said, “Oh, why did you bring us to this horrible place? We should have stayed in Egypt rather than be killed in battle and our wives and children made slaves.” The people wanted to kill them and choose a new leader to bring them back to Egypt.

Noba hilan kaganaan a Israelita, nagdiklamo hila, a wanla, “Mamanged po dayin natey kitawoyna ihtew ha Egipto o kaya ihti ha wangwang dinan matey kitawo ha labanan! Ket hilay kabono tawo, dyagen la hilan iipoh ye aahawa tawo boy aanak tawo.” Noba hiyay Moses, lamo na hilan Aaron, Josue boy Caleb, nakiiingalo hila kanlan Israelita a ahe la ya anhalanghangen ye Apo Dioh. Noba hilay Israelita, labay la hila dayin patyen. Ta mangipaideng hilayna man nin bayon dato/bildoga/mangona kanla.

God was very angry, and His presence appeared at the Tent of Meeting. God said, “Except for Joshua and Caleb, all of the people who are twenty years old or older will wander in the wilderness until they die. They will never enter the Promised Land.”

Ket hiyay Apo Dioh, napoot yan tobat. Kapipikhaan, nakit lay kahnagan nan Apo Dioh a ampakapolag ha tolda a andiyagen lan hongab. Ha nakit lay kahnagan na a ampakapolag, ket hinabi nan Apo Dioh kanan Moises a, “Hilatin totoa paibat po ha naabot ye lowampo a taon, ket ahe hilayna makahlep ha logal a impangako ko. Magpabalang-balang hila ha wangwang angga ha matey hilayna. Hiyay Josue boy Caleb bengat ye makahlep ha logal a impangako ko.”

When the people heard this, they were sorry they had sinned. They took their weapons and went to attack Canaan. Moses warned them not to go because God was not with them, but they did not listen to him.

Ha nange lan Israelita yatin hinabi nan Apo Dioh, ket nilomele hila. Noba nagkahalanan hilan oman, ta kingwa lay almah la, ket dinawohong la hilay Caneneo, agya ahe na hinabin Apo Dioh. Noba hiyay Moises, hinaad na hila a wana kanla, “Adi kawoyna ampakew.”  Noba homain nanlenge kana.

God did not go with them into this battle, so they were defeated and many of them were killed. Then the rest of the Israelites turned back from Canaan and wandered through the wilderness for forty years.

Ket hiyay Apo Dioh, adi ya nakilamo kanlan Israelita a makew makilaban kanlan Cananeo. Kaya-bay nahambot hila boy malabong ye natey kanla, ta ahe na hila nilamoan nin Apo Dioh. Ket hilay nagkotet ha laban, hilabay bengat ye napatla. Noba nagbalang-balang hilayna ha wangwang ha loob nin apatapo a taon.

During that time of wandering, God provided for them. He gave them bread from heaven, called “manna.” He also sent quail (a kind of bird) into their camp so they could have meat to eat. During those forty years, God kept their clothes and shoes from wearing out.

Ha pagbalang-balang lan Israelitan napatla, hiyay Apo Dioh, kinalingay na hila met ateed. Minamangaamot, ambyan na hilan tinapay a ibat ha langit a anhabtan “manna”. Boy ambyan na hila met nin aabeng ta omon hila makakna/makakena. Ket ha loob nin apatapo a taon, ahe bega nadonot ye hapatoh la boy bado la, oli ha pangalingay nan Apo Dioh kanla.

God even miraculously gave them water from a rock. But despite all this, the people of Israel complained and grumbled against God and against Moses. God was still faithful to His promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

Hiyay Apo Dioh, binyanan na hilan lanom ye Israelita a ibat ha dapah. Noba hilay Israelita, ampaytatalanabotoban la yay Apo Dioh boy hiyay Moises, ta anghalanghangen la hilan teed.

{{:en:obs:obs-14-13.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

One time, the people had no water. God told Moses, “Speak to the rock, and water will come out of it.” But Moses dishonored God in front of all the people by hitting the rock twice with a stick instead of speaking to it. Water came out of the rock for everyone to drink, but God was angry with Moses and said, “You will not enter the Promised Land.”

After they had wandered in the wilderness for forty years, all the people who had rebelled against God were dead. God led the Israelites to the edge of the Promised Land again. Moses was now very old, so he chose Joshua to help him lead the people. God promised Moses that one day He would raise up another prophet like Moses.

Pangayadi nin pagbalang-balang la ha wangwang a loob nin apatapo a taon, ket hilay kaganaan a nagtaon nin lowampo’ patagay ibat ha onan pamakew la ha Canaan, nangamatey hilan kaganaan. Haanin, in-ogot na hilayna man nin Apo Dioh ha anggaan nin logal a impangako na kanla. Ket ha pamiabot la ha anggaan nin logal a impangako nan Apo Dioh kanla, ket matoa yaynan tobat ye Moses. 

{{:en:obs:obs-14-15.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

God brought Moses to the top of a mountain so he could see the Promised Land. Moses saw the Promised Land but never entered it. Then Moses died, and the Israelites mourned for thirty days. Joshua became their new leader. Joshua was a good leader because he trusted and obeyed God.

Ha anti hilayna ha anggaan nin logal a impangako nan Apo Dioh kanla, inlakew na yay Moses ha babe nin matondol ta omon na matamolaw ye logal a impangako na. Pangayadi, natey yaynay Moises, ket hiyay Josue ye kahagilian na. Hiyay Josue, manged yan mangona ta ampanombong ya kanan Apo Dioh.
