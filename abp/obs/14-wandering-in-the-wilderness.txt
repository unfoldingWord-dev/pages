After the Israelites received God’s Covenant at Mount Sinai, God began leading them toward the Promised Land, which was also called Canaan. The cloud pillar showed them the way.

Hilay Israelita, ha natanggap lay bibilin nan Apo Dioh ihtew ha Mapantay nin Sinai, ket intobol na hilaynan makew ha logal a impangako na kanla. Hiyay Apo Dioh, a anti ha owep, ket maona ya kanla.

BT - The Israelites, when they received the commands of God there on the Mountain of Sinai, he sent them to go to the place which he promised them. God, he was present in the cloud, and he will-go-ahead of them.

God had promised Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob that He would give the Promised Land to their descendants, but now there were many tribes of people living there. They were called Canaanites. The Canaanites did not believe in God. They worshiped false gods and did many evil things.

Ha hatew, impangako nan Apo Dioh a byan na hilan lologal ye lalahi nan Abraham, Isaac boy Jacob. Noba ahe hila po malyadin homlep, ta main hilan latgnen a malabong a tidibo ha Canaan a logal a impangako nan Apo Dioh kanla. Hilatin tribo a anti ha Canaan, ket anhabtan Cananeo. Hilay Cananeo, ahe hila ampamteg kanan Apo Dioh. Ta hiyay ampamtegan la, dioh-diohan a anggalangen la.


BT - In time-past, God promised that he will-give the descendents of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob a place. But they still cannot enter, because they arrived-on many tribes in Canaan which is the place God promised them. These tribes which were present in Canaan, they are called Cananeo. The Cananeo (PL), they are- not -believing in God. For what they are-believing-in, false-gods which they are-worshipping/honoring.


{{:en:obs:obs-14-03.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

God told the Israelites, “You must get rid of all the Canaanites in the Promised Land. Do not make peace with them and do not marry them. You must completely destroy all of their idols. If you do not do these things, you will worship their idols instead of Me.”

Hinabi nan Apo Dioh kanlan Israelita, <<Labanan yo hilay kaganaan a Cananeo. Adi kaw ampakikakahondo kalla boy adi kaw met ampangahawa kalla. Boy katapolan a damaen yon kaganaan a diohdiohen la. No ahe yo hombongen yain a bilin ko kanyo, ket mipaloy kawo met a manggalang ha diohdiohan la. Dat no wanabay ket, aliwaynan hiko ye anggalangen yo.>>

BT - God spoke to the Israelites, <<(You-PL) fight-against all the Cananeo(PL). Don't you(PL) make-agreements with-them and don't you(PL) also marry-with them. And you(PL) must destroy all their false-gods/idols. If you(PL) are- not -following/obeying this command of mine to-you(PL), you(PL) will-be-influenced also to honor/worship their false-gods. And if like-that, not I is what you(PL) are-worshipping/honoring.>>

When the Israelites reached the edge of Canaan, Moses chose twelve men, one from each tribe of Israel. He gave the men instructions to go and spy on the land to see what it was like. They were also to spy on the Canaanites to see if they were strong or weak.

Haanin, hiyay dinapat nan Moises kanlan labinlowan lahi nan Israel, namili yan titimaghan lāki. Ket hinabi na kanla, a wana, “Makew kawo ha logal a Canaan, noba adi kawo ampakit kalla. Ta bilewen yoy logal  no manged o ahe. Boy bilewen yo po hilay tatao no makapey ye panlomaban la o no mangakhaw.”

BT - Now, what Moises did to the twelve tribes of Israel, he chose one-each male. And he spoke to-them, he-said, <<(You-PL) go to the place of Canaan, but don't you(PL) show [yourself] to-them. For you(PL) will-look if weak is their opposition/fighting or if strong.>>

The men spied on Canaan for forty days, then they came back. Ten of the spies gave a bad report, saying, “The land is very good, and the crops are great! But the cities are very strong, and the people are giants! If we attack them, we will surely die!”

Ket nakew hilan hinomlep ha Canaan a ahe napakit. Nangamaey hila ihtew nin apatapo a mangaamot ta mangimaton hila kanlan Cananeo. Ha nag-odong hilaynay labinlowan intobol na, hilay mapo kanla, imbalita la, a wanla, “Ihtewbay ha Canaan, ket malabong ye makan boy manged yay lota. Noba ahe kitawo malyadi a lomaban kanlan Cananeo, ta mangayadet hila boy maghen ye babanwa la. Ket hikitawo, ba-mo kitawon bengat kowangey a mangakandi kalla. Ta hilay tataon angkomonin ihtew, ket mangak-haw hila boy mangayadet ye lalaman la. No dawohongen tawo hila, ket mahambot kitawon homain hapo.” 

BT - And they went to enter Canaan with not causing-to-be-seen. They stayed there forty days for they will-obeserve those Cananao. When the twelve ones he sent returned, ten of them, they newsed, they-said, <<There in Canaan, many are what will-be-eaten and good is the land. But we(incl) can not fight those Cananeo, for they are big and firm are their towns. And we(incl), we(incl) are just like locusts in size to them. For the people living there, they are strong and large are their bodies. If we(incl) attack them, we(incl) will- surely -lose.>>


{{:en:obs:obs-14-06.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

Immediately Caleb and Joshua, the other two spies, said, “It is true that the people of Canaan are tall and strong, but we can certainly defeat them! God will fight for us!”

Noba hiyay Caleb boy Josue a lowa kanlan labinlowan intobol ha Canaan, tampol lan hinabi, a wanla, “Peteg a hilay tatao ihtew, ket mangak-haw boy mangayadet hila. Noba adi kitawo angkalimon lomaban kanla! Hamboten tawo hila a homain hapo. Ta lamo tawo yay Apo Dioh.”

BT - But Caleb and Josue who are two of the twelve sent to Canaan, quickly they spoke, they-said, <<True that the people there, they are strong and big. But don't let us(incl) be-afraid to fight them! We(incl) will-defeat them surely. For God is with us(incl).>>

{{:en:obs:obs-14-07.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

But the people were mad at Moses and Aaron and said, “Oh, why did you bring us to this horrible place? We should have stayed in Egypt rather than be killed in battle and our wives and children made slaves.” The people wanted to kill them and choose a new leader to bring them back to Egypt.

Noba hilan kaganaan a Israelita, angkalimo hila. Kaya-bay nagdiklamo hila, a wanla, “Mamanged po dayin natey kitawoyna ihtew ha Egipto o kaya ihti ha wangwang dinan matey kitawon bengat ha labanan! Ket hilay kalaban tawo, dyagen la hilan iipoh ye aahawa tawo boy hilay aanak tawo.” 
Noba hiyay Moses, Aaron, Josue boy Caleb, nakiiingalo hila kanlan Israelita, a wanla, <<Adi yo ankontadaen ye Apo Dioh.>>
Noba hilay Israelita, hinabi la, a wanla, <<Ahe mi labay a hikawo ye mangona kammi. Mamanged a mag-odong kayiyna ingat ha Egipto!>> 

BT - But all Israelites, they are-being-afraid. Therefore they complained, they-said, <<Better still (desire particle) we(incl) died there in Egipto o even here in the desert than we(incl) will- just -die in battle! And our(incl) enemy, they will-make our(incl) wives and our(incl) children slaves.>
But Moses, Aaron, Josue and Caleb, they asked-mercy/pleaded to the Israelites, they-said, <<Don't you(PL) go-against/oppose God.>>
But the Israelites, they spoke, the-said, <<We(excl) don't want that you(PL) will-lead us(excl). Better that we(excl) return to Egipto!>>

{{:en:obs:obs-14-08.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

God was very angry, and His presence appeared at the Tent of Meeting. God said, “Except for Joshua and Caleb, all of the people who are twenty years old or older will wander in the wilderness until they die. They will never enter the Promised Land.”

Ket hilay Israelita, ondagan la yayna dayin dapah ye Moises. Hiyay Apo Dioh, napoot yan tobat. Kapipikhaan, hiyay kahnagan nan Apo Dioh a ampakapolag, nikakaanti yayna ha toldan panggalangan. Ha nakit lan Israelita ye kahnagan a ampakapolag, ket hinabi nan Apo Dioh kanan Moises, a wana, “Hilay totoan Israelita a lowampo a taon ye edad patagay, ket ahe hilayna makahlep ha logal a impangako ko. Magpabalang-balang hilayna ha wangwang angga ha matey hilayna. Noba hilay main edad lowampo paaypa boy hiyay Josue boy Caleb ye makahlep ha logal a impangako ko.”

BT - And the Israelites, they will-drop stones (desire particle) on Moises. God, he was very angry. Suddenly, the brightness of God which is-shining, it was present now at the tent of worshipping-place. When the Israelites saw the shining light, God spoke to Moises, he-said, <<The elder Israelites who are twenty years age going-up, they can- not -enter the place I promised. They will-wander-around in the deserted-place until they will-die. But those aged twenty and below and Josue and Caleb are the ones who will-be-able-to-enter the place I promised.>>

{{:en:obs:obs-14-09.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

When the people heard this, they were sorry they had sinned. They took their weapons and went to attack Canaan. Moses warned them not to go because God was not with them, but they did not listen to him.

Ha nange lan Israelita yatin hinabi nan Apo Dioh, nilomele hila. Ket paholong ye pagkahalanan la, ta kingwa lay almah la boy dinawohong la hilay Cananeo, agya ahe na hilan nilamoan nan Apo Dioh. Noba hiyay Moises, hinaad na hila, a wana kanla, “Adi kawoyna ampakew.”  Noba homain nanlenge kana.

BT - When the Israelites heard this that God said, they became-sad. And their sinning continued, for they took their arms/weapons and they attacked the Cananeo(PL), even-though God did not companion-with them. But Moises, he told-to-stop, he-said to-them, <<Don't you(PL) go.>> But none listened to-him.

{{:en:obs:obs-14-10.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

God did not go with them into this battle, so they were defeated and many of them were killed. Then the rest of the Israelites turned back from Canaan and wandered through the wilderness for forty years.

Ket hiyay Apo Dioh, agna hila nilamoan ye Israelita a makew makilaban kanlan Cananeo. Kaya-bay nahambot hila boy malabong ye natey kanla. Ket hilay Israelitan napatla a nakilaban, nagbalang-balang hilayna ha wangwang ha loob nin apatapo a taon.

BT - God, he did not companion-with the Israelites to go fight those Cananeo. Therefore they were-defeated and many of them died. And the Israelites left from the battle, they wandered-around in the deserted-place forty years.

{{:en:obs:obs-14-11.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

During that time of wandering, God provided for them. He gave them bread from heaven, called “manna.” He also sent quail (a kind of bird) into their camp so they could have meat to eat. During those forty years, God kept their clothes and shoes from wearing out.

Ha pagbalang-balang lan Israelitan napatla, ket kinalingay na hila met ateed nin Apo Dioh. Minamangaamot na hilan ambyan nin tinapay a ibat ha langit a anhabtan “manna”. Boy ambyan na hila met nin aabeng ta omon hila makakena. Ket hiyay hapatoh la boy bado la, ahe bega nadonot ha loob nin apatapo a taon, oli ha pangalingay nan Apo Dioh kanla.

BT - When the remaining Israelites are-wandering-around, God still took-care-of them. Everyday he is-giving them bread from heaven which is-being-called "manna". And he also is-giving them quails that they will-be-able-to-eat-meat. And their shoes and their clothes, were not at all worn-out inside of 40 years, because of the caring-for them of God.

{{:en:obs:obs-14-12.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

God even miraculously gave them water from a rock. But despite all this, the people of Israel complained and grumbled against God and against Moses. God was still faithful to His promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

Hilay Israelita, agya anti hila ha wangwang, binyanan na hilan Apo Dioh nin lanom a ibat ha dapah. Noba hilay Israelita, ampaytatalabotoban la yay Moises boy Apo Dioh. Noba agya wanabay man, mikakaanti ya po ateed ye pangakon Apo Dioh kalla a impangako na kanan Abraham, Isaac, boy Jacob ha hatew.

BT - The Israelites, even-though they are present in the deserted-place, Apo God gave the Israelites water. But the Israelites, they grumbled-against Moses and God. But even-though like-that, always-present still is the promise of God to-them which he promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in time-past.

{{:en:obs:obs-14-13.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

One time, the people had no water. God told Moses, “Speak to the rock, and water will come out of it.” But Moses dishonored God in front of all the people by hitting the rock twice with a stick instead of speaking to it. Water came out of the rock for everyone to drink, but God was angry with Moses and said, “You will not enter the Promised Land.”

Maghay mangaamot, homain hilan lanom a mainom. Hinabi nan Apo Dioh kanan Moises, <<Habiyen mo ihtew ha dapah a lomwah yay lanom kana boy pagkayadi, lomwah yay lanom.>> Noba ahe na hinombong ye hinabi nan Apo Dioh kana no aliwan binadog-badog na yan teken nin ikaloway okdo. Kapipikhaan, linomwah yay lanom kanan dapah. Kaya-bay nakainom hilay kaganaan a tatao. Noba napoot yay Apo Dioh kanan Moises. Hinabi na, <<Ahe kayna makahlep ha logal a impangako ko kanyo. Ta ahe mo hinbombong ye hinabi ko kamo.>>

BT - One day, there was no water to drink. God spoke to Moises, <<(You) speak there to the rock that the water will-come-out of-it and afterwards, water will-come-out.>> But he did- not -follow/obey what God told him but rather he-struck-with walking-stick two times. Suddenly, water came-out of the rock. Therefore all people were-able-to-drink. But God was-angry with Moises. He said, <<You can- not -enter the place I promised to-you(PL). For you did not follow/obey what I told to-you.>>

After they had wandered in the wilderness for forty years, all the people who had rebelled against God were dead. God led the Israelites to the edge of the Promised Land again. Moses was now very old, so he chose Joshua to help him lead the people. God promised Moses that one day He would raise up another prophet like Moses.

Pangayadi nin pagbalang-balang la ha wangwang ha loob nin apatapo a taon, ket homain anan totowan angkabi-ay a nagtaon nin maigit anemapo', ta nangamatey hilan kaganaan ha wangwang. Haanin, in-ogot na hilayna man nin Apo Dioh ha anggaan nin logal a impangako na kanla. Ket ha pamiabot la ha anggaan nin logal a impangako nan Apo Dioh kanla, ket matoa yaynan tobat ye Moises. 

BT - After their wandering-around in the deserted-place inside of forty years, there were no longer elders living aged above sixty, for they all died in the deserted-place. Now, God brought them to the edge of the place he promised to-them. When they arrived at the edge of the place God promised to-them, Moises was very old already.

{{:en:obs:obs-14-15.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

God brought Moses to the top of a mountain so he could see the Promised Land. Moses saw the Promised Land but never entered it. Then Moses died, and the Israelites mourned for thirty days. Joshua became their new leader. Joshua was a good leader because he trusted and obeyed God.

Ha anti hilayna ha anggaan nin logal a impangako nan Apo Dioh kanla, inlakew na yay Moises ha pitondolan ta omon na po matamolaw ye logal a impangako na bayo ya matey ye Moises. Ha natey yayna, ket hiyay Josue ye kahagilian nan mangona. Hiyay Josue, manged yan mangona ta ampanombong ya kanan Apo Dioh.

BT - When they are present already at the edge of the place God promised to-them, he brought Moises to the mountain-peak in order that he will-see-from-distance the place he promised before Moises will-die. When he died, Josue is the replacement to lead. Josue, he was a good leader for he is-following/obeying God.
