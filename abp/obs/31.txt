Then Jesus told the disciples to get into a boat and sail to the other side of the lake while he dismissed the crowd. After Jesus had sent the crowd away, he went up on a mountain to pray. Jesus was there all alone, and he prayed long into the evening.

Legan ampaolien nan Apo Jesus ye tatao, ket pinalogan na hilay mānombong na ha bangka. Ta pinaona na hilan lomipay ha nagdagatdagat. Ket ha nakaalih hilaynay tatao, hiyay Apo Jesus, nakew yayna met ha mapantay ta makigwang ya, ket nadegleman ya ihtew. (Matt 14:22-23)

Meanwhile, the disciples’ boat was a long way from land. They were in danger, because a storm had come up and the boat was being tossed around by the waves and the wind.

Haanin, hilay mānombong na a anlomipay, ha anti hila po bengat ha bonak nin nagdagatdagat. Ampihahanggiyap ye bangka la ta mangak-haw ye dadawyon boy angkadopag lay mak-haw a angin.  (Matt 14:24)

Jesus decided to go to them, so he walked on top of the water across the lake toward the boat!

Ket ha palbangon ana, hinomombong yay Apo Jesus kanlan mānombong nan nakalogan nin bangka angkomodang ha babe' lanom a palakew kanla. (Matt 14:25)

The disciples were very afraid when they saw Jesus, because they thought they were seeing a ghost. Jesus knew that they were afraid, so he called out to them and said, “Do not be afraid. It is I!”

Ha nakit la a main angkomodang ha babe lanom, kinomolih hila. Ta kinalimwan la yan tobat. Ket hinabi la a, “Anito! Anito!”  Noba tampol nan hinabin Apo Jesus kanla a, “Adi kawo angkalimo. Pak-hawen yoy nakem yo. Ta hiko yati.” (Matt 14:26-27)

Then Peter said to Jesus, “Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water.” Jesus told Peter, “Come!”

Haanin, nangha yay Pedro a wana, “Apo! No peteg a hika yain, ingaten mo ko man awod a makew ihen kammo a komodang ha babe lanom!” Nakibat yay Apo Jesus kanan Pedro a wana, “Higi, makew ka ihti.” (Matt 14:28-29b)

So, Peter got out of the boat and started walking to Jesus on the surface of the water. But after a short distance, he turned his eyes away from Jesus and began to look at the strong wind and waves.

Ket haanin, linomombah yay Pedro ha bangka. Ta kinomodang yan peteg ha babe lanom a makew kana. (Matt 14:29b)

Then Peter became afraid and began to sink. He cried out, “Lord, save me!” Jesus reached out right away and grabbed him. Then he said to Peter, “O you of little faith, why did you doubt?”

Noba ha nakit nan Pedro ye mangak-haw a dawoyon, nalimowan ya ket anlomdeg yayna. Ket impangha nay, “Apo! Apo! Iligtah mo ko!” Ket hiyay Apo Jesus, tampol na yan inagwang boy hinabi na kana a, “Kolang ye pamteg mo! Taket ta ampaglowalowa ka?” (Matt 14:30-31)

When Peter and Jesus got into the boat, the wind immediately stopped. The disciples were amazed. They worshiped Jesus, saying to him, “Truly, you are the Son of God.”

Haanin, linomapat hila ha bangka. Ket ha panlomampat la, nilong-em anay mak-haw a dawoyon boy mak-haw a angin. Hilay mānombong na a anti ha bangka, ha nakit laynan tinomgen ye mak-haw a dawoyon boy agoot, ket inggalang la ya, “Apo, hikan talaga ye makapalyadiayan! Ta peteg a hika ye Anak nin Dioh!” (Matt 14:32-33)
