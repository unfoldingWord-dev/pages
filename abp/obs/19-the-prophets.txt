Throughout the history of the Israelites, God sent them prophets. The prophets heard messages from God and then told the people God’s messages.


Paibat ha onan panaon, an-itobol nan Apo Dioh ye popropita na a makew kanlan Israelita. Ta hilabay anay mangibalita kanlan tatao nin bibilin nan Apo Dioh.

Elijah was a prophet when Ahab was king over Israel. Ahab was an evil man who encouraged people to worship a false god named Baal. Elijah said to Ahab, “There will be no rain or dew in Israel until I say so.”

Hatew ha panaon nan Poon Acab, hiyay Elias ye podopita ha Israel. Hiyay Poon Acab, inadalan na hilay tataon manggalang kanan Baal a aliwan peteg a Dioh. Ket hinabi nan Elias kana, a wana, <<Tandah yan mangodan ha kaganaan a lologal nin Israel agya dalaidi bengat anggan ahe ko po habiyen a mangodan oman.>> Kaya-bay napoot yan tobat ye Poon Acab.

Then God told Elijah to hide in the wilderness near a stream. Every morning and every evening, birds would bring him bread and meat. Ahab and his army looked for Elijah, but they could not find him. The drought was so severe that the stream eventually dried up.

Hilay tatao nan Poon Acab, antapolen la yay Elias. Noba ahe la ya nakitan ta pinatayo na yan Apo Dioh ha maghay logal a main hobol a ampinoman. Ket tepe mahanib, main oowak a ampangilakew kana nin tinapay boy kena. Noba oli ta homain anan odan, ket namal-an yaynay hobol a ampinoman na.

So Elijah went to a neighboring country. A widow and her son had almost run out of food because of the famine. But they took care of Elijah, and God provided so that neither their flour jar nor their bottle of oil ever ran out. They had food through the whole famine. Elijah stayed there a long time.

Ket hiyay Apo Dioh, pinalakew na yay Elias ha maghan badyon maahaley. Main met bawo ihtewbay. Ket main yan maghay anak a laki. Boy madanon anan maoboh ye pamangan la, oli ha nilalo anan kaamotan. Noba agya wanabay man, pinaona laya po a pinakan ye Elias. Ket ahe la angkaobohoboh ye tapok la, boy ahe la angkaobohoboh ye taba a panonggit, ta hiyay Apo Dioh ye namyay nin pamangan la anggan anti ya po ye Elias ihtewbay.

After three years, God told Elijah to return to Israel and speak with Ahab because He was going to send rain again. When Ahab saw Elijah he said, “There you are, you troublemaker!” Elijah said, “You are the troublemaker! You have abandoned the true God and worshiped Baal. Bring all of Israel to Mount Carmel.”

Pangalabah nin tatlon taon boy kagitna, hinabi nan Apo Dioh kanan Elias, a wana, <<Mag-odong kayna ha Israel, ta habiyen mo kanan Poon Acab a paodanen ko yan oman.>> Noba ha nakit na yay Elias a ampaghabi, hinabi na met kanan Elias, a wana, <<Ah! Anti kan bengat manayti ihen a mapanggolo ha Israel!>> Nakibat yay Elias, a wana, <<Hikay mapanggolo ha Israel! Ta naliwaan moy peteg a Dioh. Ket haanin, ampanggalang kayna kanan Baal a aliwan peteg a dioh. Kaya-bay haanin, itobol mo hilay tatao a makew ha matondol nan Carmelo.>>


{{:en:obs:obs-19-06.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


All of Israel, including the 400 prophets of Baal, came to Mount Carmel. Elijah said, “How long will you keep changing your mind? If the LORD is God, serve Him! If Baal is God, serve him!”

Kaya-bay nakew hilan kaganaan a tatao ihtew ha matondol nan Carmelo, lamo la hilay 450 a popodopeta nan Baal. Ket hinabi nan Elias kanlan Israelita, a wana, <<Paholong nayi a paoman oman ye ihip yo a maghilbi kanan Apo Dioh a peteg a Dioh? Noba no hiyay Baal ye peteg a Dioh, ket hiyaba anan bengat ye paghilbiyan yo!>>


{{:en:obs:obs-19-07.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Then he said to the prophets of Baal, “Kill a bull and prepare a sacrifice, but do not light the fire. I will do the same. The God who answers with fire is the real God.” So the priests of Baal prepared a sacrifice but did not light the fire.

Pangayadi, hinabi nan podopeta Elias kanlan popodopeta nan Baal, a wana, <<No hiyay Baal ye peteg a Dioh, mangwa kawo man awod nin hinapo a kena a ihagpa yo kana ta olamen yo. Noba adi yo anggawien a pamadlag ye apoy ta hiyay Baal a dioh yo ye mangaolam. Ta agya hiko met, wanabay met ateed ye dapaten ko papainghan. Ket dinapat lan peteg nin podopeta nan Baal ye hinabi nan podopeta Elias.


{{:en:obs:obs-19-08.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Then they prayed to Baal, “Hear us, O Baal!” All day long they prayed and shouted and even cut themselves with knives, but Baal did not answer.

Ket nakigwang hila, a wanla, <<Dioh min Baal, leng-en mo kayi.>> Nikahilem hilan ampakigwang a ampangha boy an-iwaen la po ye lalaman la noba homain yan pakibat ye Baal.


{{:en:obs:obs-19-09.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


At the end of the day, Elijah prepared a sacrifice to God. Then he had twelve huge pots of water poured on top of the sacrifice until the meat, the wood, and even the ground around the altar was completely wet.

Ket ha mahilem ana, hiyay Elias met ye mangihagpa nin baka kanan Apo Dioh a anggalangen na. Ket hiyay dinapat na, pinabohbohan na po nin labinlowan halaw a lanome ye hagpa na. Ket naheb anan lanom ye pandongot boy palibot nin hagpa.


{{:en:obs:obs-19-10.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Then Elijah prayed, “O LORD, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, show us today that You are the God of Israel and that I am Your servant. Answer me so that these people will know that You are God.”

Pangayadi nan impabohbohan, ket nakigwang ya, a wana, <<Apo a Dioh nan Abraham, Isaac boy Hacob. Ipakit mo haanin a hika ye peteg a Dioh nin Israel boy hika ye Dioh ko a ampaghilbi kamo. Ket leng-en mo Apo ye pamakigwang ko kamo ta omen la matandaan nin tatao a hika ye peteg a Dioh.>>


{{:en:obs:obs-19-11.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Immediately, fire fell from the sky and burned up the meat, the wood, the rocks, and even the wet ground around the altar. When the people saw this, they fell on the ground and said, “The LORD is God! The LORD is God!”

Kapipikhaan, nagampag ye apoy a ibat ha langit a nangolam nin baka, kayo boy dadapah angga ha kinomlang ye lota ha palibot nin pangihagpaan. Ket ha nakit lan tatao yatin nalyadi, nanlimokod hila boy hinabi la, a wanla, <<Hika Apo Dioh ye peteg a Dioh! Hika Apo Dioh ye peteg a Dioh!>>


{{:en:obs:obs-19-12.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Then Elijah said, “Do not let any of the prophets of Baal escape!” So the people captured the prophets of Baal. Then Elijah took them away and killed them.

Ket hinabi nan Elias kanlan tatao, a wana, <<Dakepen yo hila! Adi yo hila ampaolayen a makatakah ye poporopeta nan Baal!>> Kaya-bay, dinakep la hila boy pinatey.


{{:en:obs:obs-19-13.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Then Elijah said to King Ahab, “Return immediately to the city, for the rain is coming.” Soon the sky grew black, and a large rain storm came. God had ended the drought and proved that He is the only God.

Ket hinabi na met nin Elias kanan Poon Hacob, a wana, <<Tampol kaynan mag-odong ha mayadet a banwa ta madanon yaynay malgeh/makhaw a odan.>> Ahe nagboyot, nangodan yanan peteg nin makhaw/malgeh boy makhaw a agoot. Ha pangayadi nin makhaw a agoot, ket natandaan laynay Dioh a kaptegan oli kananyatin panaon a nalyadi.


{{:en:obs:obs-19-14.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


After Elijah, God chose Elisha to be His prophet. God did many miracles through Elisha. One time, Naaman, an enemy commander, found out he had a horrible skin disease called leprosy. He had heard of Elisha so he went and asked Elisha to be healed. Elisha told him to dip himself seven times in the Jordan River.

Ha nanik yay Elias ha langit, ket hiyay Eliseo met ye hinombolat a bilang podopeta. Boy malabong a okdo ye dinyag nan Apo Dioh a kapagtakaan makaoli kanan Eliseo. Hiyay maghan kapagtakaan a dinyag nan Apo Dioh, ket hiyay pamaitaah nan Eliso kanan Naaman a kapitan nin tataon kalaban ha logal la. Main yan mabyat a hakit ha loti, ket nabalitaan nay tongkol kanan Eliseo. Kaya-bay pinakihabi na a paitaahen yan podopeta. Ket ha wanabay, intobol na yan Eliseo ye Elias a makew donglep nin piton okdo ha Kabatowan nin Jordan.


{{:en:obs:obs-19-15.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


At first Naaman was angry and would not do it. But later he changed his mind and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan River. When he came up the last time, his skin was completely healed! God had healed him.

Ha pamakange nan Naaman nin hinabi nan Eliseo, napoot ya boy agya nanopad. Noba ha hoyot a mangaamot/panaon, ket dinonglep ya met a teed nin piton okdo. Ket ha ikapiton pangomondolaw nan Naaman, ket homain yaynan hakit ha loit, ta pinaimonaw na yaynan Apo Dioh.


{{:en:obs:obs-19-16.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


There were many other prophets. They all told the people to stop worshiping idols and to start showing justice and mercy. The prophets warned the people that if they did not turn from their sins and start living obedient lives, then God’s judgment would come, and He would punish them.


Hilay popropeta, lanang lan an-ibalita kanlan tatao, a wanla, “Maghehe kawo ha kakahalanan yo boy itgen yoynay panggalang yon kanayon a andiohen. Ta no ahe kawo manopad ha bibilin nin Apo Dioh, homain hapo a padohaan na kawo.”


{{:en:obs:obs-19-17.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Most of the time, the people did not listen. They often mistreated the prophets and sometimes even killed them. Once, the prophet Jeremiah was put into a dry well and left there to die. He sank down into the mud that was in the bottom of the well, but then the king had mercy on him and pulled him out before he died.


Noba, adi lan teed an-ibabano ye bibilin a an-ibalita lan popropeta na. No minghan, ampahakitan la hila boy ampateyen la hila a omon kanan propita Jeremias a pinatey la. Ta in-ampag la ya ha namal-an a libon boy linakwanan la ya ta omon ya matey ihtewbay.


{{:en:obs:obs-19-18.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Even though the prophets were hated, they continued to speak for God. They warned people that they would be destroyed if they did not repent. They also reminded people of the promise that God’s Messiah would come.


Hilay popropeta, agya naidapan hila, ket imbabala lan teed ye impatanda nan Apo Dioh kanla. Imbabala la, a wanla, “No homain kawon paghehe ha kakahalanan yo, madama kawo.” Imbalita la met, a wanla, “Yo! Ihipen yoy impangako nan Apo Dioh a itobol na yay Mesias a Mangiligtah kantao ihtew ha matibhoen logal/babe lota.”
