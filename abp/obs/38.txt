Jesus had been preaching for about three years. It was the time of the Passover Feast when the Jews remembered how God had saved them from slavery in Egypt many years earlier. Jesus knew what would happen to him and told his disciples he was going to Jerusalem where he would be killed.

Hiyay Apo Jesus, nangiadal yayna kanlan tatao ha loob nin tatloy taon. Haanin, madanon anay Pihta nin Tinapay a Homain Pampalbag a anhabtan met Pihtan Pangihipan nin Kaligtahan. Tanda nan Apo Jesus a maipatey ya ihtew. Kaya-bay hinabi na yatew kanlan mānombong na. (Lucas 22:1)

The Jewish leaders in Jerusalem had rejected Jesus as the Messiah and were plotting to kill him. Judas was one of Jesus’ disciples. He was in charge of the disciples’ money, but he was dishonest and often stole from it. Judas went to the Jewish leaders and offered to betray Jesus to them.

Hilay ampanakop kanlan papadi boy hilay mamaihtodo nin bibilin, ket ampangihip hilan papadān no way-omon la ya maipapatey ye Apo Jesus a homain bega makatanda a tatao. Kaya-bay ampangimaton hila kanlan tatao.  Hiyay Judas a anhabtan Iscariote, magha ya kanlan labinloway mānombong nan Apo Jesus. Noba napahakop ya kanan Satanas. Ket haanin, hiyay Judas, nakew ya kanlan popoon nin papadi boy kanlan ampamaala kanlan māgbantay nin Himbaan nan Apo Dioh ta hinabi nan Judas kanla, a wana, “No labay yo, managlap akon mandakep kanan Apo Jesus.” (Luke 22:2-4)

The Jewish leaders, led by the high priest, paid Judas thirty pieces of silver to betray Jesus. This happened just as the prophets had predicted. Judas agreed, took the money, and went away, looking for a chance to help them arrest Jesus.

Ket hilay popoon nin papadi boy hilay ampamaala kanlan māgbantay nin Himbaan, naaliket hila oli ha hinabi nan Judas kanla ta napaykakahondoan layna kanan Judas, a wanla, “Higi, biyan la kan pilak.” Ket inomayon ya met ye Judas kanla. Kaya-bay paibat kananyatew, ampangagad yaynan bengat nin panaon a malyadi na yan maigawang ye Apo Jesus kanla a ahe la kamatandaan nin tatao. (Luke 22:5-6)

Jesus celebrated the Passover Feast with his disciples. During the meal Jesus took bread and broke it, saying, “Take and eat this. It is my body, which is broken for you. Do this to remember me.” In this way, Jesus said that his body would be sacrificed for them.

Ha naabot anay odah nin pandeman, hiyay Apo Jesus boy hilay mānombong na, ket domoyong hilaynan mangan. Ket haanin, nangwa yan maghay tinapay, ta pinahalamatan na ya kanan Apo Dioh. Ket ginitna nay tinapay haka na in-ibiyay kanlan mānombong na boy naghabi ya, a wana, “Yatin tinapay ye kalalayian nin laman ko a ihagpa ko ha ikanged yo. Diyagen yo yati a pangihipan yo kangko.” (Luke 22:14,19)

Then he took a cup of wine and said, “Drink this. It is my blood of the New Covenant shed for the forgiveness of sins. Do this to remember me as often as you drink it.” In this way, Jesus said that his blood would be poured out to forgive their sins.

Haanin, hiyay Apo Jesus, nangwa yan maghay bahon alak, ta pinahalamatan na ya kanan Apo Dioh. Ket ha nayadi na yaynan pinahalamatan, hinabi na, a wana, “Kowen yo yati, ta paytitikandiyan yon inomen.” Ha wanabay, hinabi nan Apo Jesus a makaoli ha daya na, patawaden nay kakahalanan tawo. (Luke 22:17)

Then Jesus said to the disciples, “One of you will betray me.” The disciples were surprised and did not know who would do such a thing. Jesus said, “The person to whom I give this piece of bread is the betrayer.” Then he gave the bread to Judas.

Hinabi na po nin Apo Jesus, a wana, “Agya wanabay man, leng-en yo! Hiyay taon mangipaloke lano kangko, ket magha ya kantawon ampangan ihti! Ta nakataning akoynan matey. Noba kakaingalo yay taon mangipaloke kangko!” Ket ha nange lan mānombong na yati, naytepet-tepet hila, a wanla, “Hinya lagi kantawo ye manyag nin yatin kalok-an?” 
Nakibat yay Apo Jesus, a wana, “Hiyay taon biyan kon indede kon tinapay, hiyabay ana yatew.” Haanin, ha nayadi nan indede ye tinapay, inbiyay na kanan Judas a anak nan Simon Iscariote.  (Luke 22:21-23, John 13:26)

After Judas took the bread, Satan entered into him. Judas left to help the Jewish leaders arrest Jesus. It was night.

Ha natanggap nan Judas ye tinapay, hinomlep yaynay Satanas kana. Kinan nay tinapay haka ya tampol linomwah ta inomalih ya kananhiyatew a madeglem. (John 13:27,30)

After the meal, Jesus and his disciples walked to the Mount of Olives. Jesus said, “All of you will all abandon me tonight. It is written, ‘I will strike the shepherd and all the sheep will be scattered.’”

\v 31 Haanin, ha ampakew hila ha Mapantay nin Oolibo, hinabi nan Apo Jesus kanlan mānombong na, a wana, “Kananyatin madeglem, hikawon kaganaan, ket lakwanan yoko, ta hinabi nin Dioh ha Nahantowan a Kaholatan, a, ‘Hiyay pahtol, pateyen ko ya lano ket mapayngingihyay ye gidan kakalnilo.’ (Mat 26:31)


{{:en:obs:obs-38-09.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

Peter replied, “Even if all the others leave you, I will not!” Then Jesus said to Peter, “Satan wants to have all of you, but I have prayed for you, Peter, that your faith will not fail. Even so, tonight, before the rooster crows, three times you will deny that you even know me.”

Haanin, hinabi nan Pedro kanan Apo Jesus, a wana, “Apo, agya lakwanan lakan kaganaan, noba hiko, ahe kata boga lakwanan!” 
Hinabi nan Apo Jesus kana, a wana, “Pakaleng-en yon manged ye habiyen ko. Bayo tomnoy ye tandang a kananyatin madeglem, ket mikatlo mo koynan imbodi a katatanda moko.” (Mat 26:33-34)

{{:en:obs:obs-38-10.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

Peter then said to Jesus, “Even if I must die, I will never disown you!” All the other disciples said the same thing.

Hinabi nan Pedro a, “Agya lamo mo kon matey, ahe kata boga ibodi.” Wanabay met ateed ye hinabi lan kanayon a mānombong na. (Mat 26:35)


{{:en:obs:obs-38-11.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane. Jesus told his disciples to pray that they would not fall into temptation. Then Jesus went to pray by himself.

Haanin, hiyay Apo Jesus, nakew ya ha Mapantay nin Oolibo. Ta wanabay ye nakailmawan na. Ket hilay mānombong na, hinombong la ya. Ha niabot hilayna ihtew, hinabi nan Apo Jesus kanlan mānombong na, a wana, “Makigwang kawo ta omon kawo ahe matokho nin kahalanan.” Haanin, hiyay Apo Jesus, tinomaang yan makandi kanla, ta nanalimokod yan nakigwang.  (Luke 22:39-41)

{{:en:obs:obs-38-12.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

Jesus prayed three times, “My Father, if there is no other way for people’s sins to be forgiven, Your will be done.” Jesus was very troubled and his sweat was like drops of blood. God sent an angel to strengthen him.

Wanae ye pamakigwang na, “Bapa ko, no kalabayan mo, alihen mo yatin kaidapan a madihaan ko. Noba aliwan kalabayan ko ye mahombong, no aliwan kalabayan mo ye mahombong.”
Ket oli ta tobat anan mahakit ye angkatanam nan Apo Jesus, lalo yaynan nakigwang nin loboh anggayna ha omon anan kadih daya ye haynget nan tinomolo ha lota. Haanin, napakit ya kana ye pānobolen nin Dioh a ibat ha langit, ta pinak-haw nay nakem nan Apo Jesus. (Luke 22:42,44,43)


{{:en:obs:obs-38-13.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

After each time of prayer, Jesus came back to his disciples, but they were asleep. After the third time, Jesus said, “Wake up! My betrayer is here.”

Haanin, ha nayadi yaynan nakigwang, nakew yayna kanlan mānombong na. Linomopta hila oli ha kalelean la. Ket nalatngan na hila met a angkatoloy. Hinabi nan Apo Jesus kanla, a wana, “Taket ta angkatoloy kawo? Mimata kawo boy makigwang kawo ta omon kawo ahe matokho nin kahalanan.” 
Ha ikatlon okdo, hiyay Apo Jesus, tinomaang yay naman ket nakigwang ya a omon ha onan pakigwangna. Pangayadi, nag-odong yay naman kanlan mānombong na, ket hinabi na kanla, a, “Angkatoloy kawoy naman boy ampagpainawa? Mimata kawo, tawoyna! Ta anti yayna ye taon mangipaloke kangko.”  (Luke 22:45-46, Mat 26:44-46)


{{:en:obs:obs-38-14.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

Judas came with the Jewish leaders, soldiers, and a large crowd carrying swords and clubs. He came to Jesus and said, “Greetings, teacher,” and kissed him. This was the sign for the Jewish leaders to know whom to arrest. Then Jesus said, “Judas, do you betray me with a kiss?”

Ha ampaghabi ya po ye Apo Jesus, linomateng hilay malabong a tatao. Ket hiyay Judas a magha kanlan labinlowan mānombong na ye ampangona kanlan tatao. Hinomaley ya kanan Apo Jesus, ta inomaan na ya. Noba hinabi nan Apo Jesus kana, a wana, “Judas, oma nayi ye pangipaloke mo kangko?” (Luk 22:47)


{{:en:obs:obs-38-15.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

As the soldiers arrested Jesus, Peter pulled out his sword and cut off the ear of the high priest’s servant. Jesus said, “Put the sword away! I could ask the Father for an army of angels to defend me. But I must obey my Father.” Then Jesus healed the man’s ear, and all the disciples ran away.

Ha nakit lan ang-adalan na ye angkalyadi, hinabi la kanan Apo Jesus, a wanla, “Apo, tayaen mi hilayna nayi?”Haanin, hiyay maghay ang-adalan nan Apo Jesus, tinaya na yay maghay ipoh nin pinakapoon lan papadi, ket napongohan yan talinga ha dapit wanan. Noba hinabi nan Apo Jesus, a wana, “Itgen yoyna yain!” Haanin, hinaleyan na yay ipoh, ta ginep-an nay talinga nan ipoh, ta pinaitaah na ya. Haanin, hilay kaganaan a mānombong na, napayngingihyay hilayna. (Luk 22:49-51, Mat 26:56b)
