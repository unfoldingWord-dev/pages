After Joshua died, the Israelites disobeyed God and did not drive out the rest of the Canaanites or obey God’s laws. The Israelites began to worship the Canaanite gods instead of the One True God. The Israelites had no king, so everyone did what they thought was right for them.

Ha panaon nan Josue, ampanombong hilay Israelita ha kalabayan nan Apo Dioh. Noba ha natey yayna, ahe la hinombong ye bilin nan Apo Dioh kanla boy ahe layna pinaalih ye kaganaan a kalahin tataon angkomonin ihtew ha Canaan. No aliwan, nakitowad hilaynan nanggalang ha dioh-diohan  lan kalahin tataon angkomonin ihtew. Kananyatew a panaon, homain hilan poon ye Israelita. Kaya-bay kalabayan laynan bengat ye andiyagen nin balang magha kanla.

BT - In the time of Josue, the Israelites are-following/obeying the will/desire of Apo God. But when he died, they did not follow/obey the commands of Apo God to-them and they did not cause-to-leave all the clans of people living there in Canaan. But rather they imitated honoring/worshipping the false-gods of the clans of people living there. At that time, the Israelites have no ruler. So just their will/desire only is what each one of them is doing.

As a result of this disobedience, God punished the Israelites by allowing them to be defeated by their enemies. These enemies stole from the Israelites, destroyed their property, and killed many of them. After many years, the Israelites repented and asked God to rescue them.


Oli ha kabyangan nin ō lan Israelita, hiyay Apo Dioh, pinalobohan na hilan hamboten nin kaaway la. Ket hilatin kaaway la, tinakaw boy dinama lay babandi lan Israelita. Boy pinatey la hilay kanayon kanla. Pangalabah nin mangaanoy taon a kaidapan la, nakigwang hila kanan Apo Dioh, a wanla, <<Apo Dioh, amgpaghehean mi ye kakahalanan mi kammo. Kaya-bay patawaden mo kayi dayi. Ampakiiingalo kayi kammo a iligtah mo kayi kanlan kaaway mi!>>


BT - Because of the hardness of the heads of the Israelites, Apo God, he allowed that their enemies will-defeat them. And these enemies of theirs, they stole and destroyed the possessions/wealth of the Israelites. And they killed some of them. After how many years of their hardship, they prayed to Apo God, they-said, <<Apo God, we(excl) are-repenting of our(excl) sins to-you. So (you) forgive us (excl) (desire particle). We(excl) are-asking-mercy to-you that you save us(excl) from our(excl) enemies!>>

{{:en:obs:obs-16-03.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Then God provided a deliverer who rescued them from their enemies and brought peace to the land. But then the people forgot about God and started worshiping idols again. So God allowed the Midianites, a nearby enemy tribe, to defeat them.

Kaya-bay oli ha pangingalo nan Apo Dioh ha hinabi lan Israelita, magha met ateed kanlan Israelita ye pinili nan mangiligtah la. Noba angkaliwaan layna man ye Apo Dioh ket nanggalang hilayna man ha diohdiohen. Kaya-bay impaloboh nan Apo Dioh a manambot hilay Midianita kanla.

BT - So because of the mercy of Apo God at what the Israelites said, one also again of the Israelita is whom he chose as their savior. But they are-forgetting Apo God and they honored again false-gods. So Apo God allowed that the Midianita will-defeat them.

{{:en:obs:obs-16-04.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


They took all of the Israelites’ crops for seven years. The Israelites were so scared, they hid in caves so the Midianites would not find them. Finally, they cried out to God to save them.


Nahakop hilan Midian ye Israelita ha loob nin pitoy taon. Ket ha loob nin hilain a taon, hilay Midianita ye ampangwa nin aapit la. Ket hilay Israelita, oli ha limo la, ampagtayo hila ha yoyokib ta omon la hilan ahe makitan lan Midianita. Ha kalinghoyotan, ket nakiingalo hilayna man kanan Apo Dioh, a wanla, <<Apo Dioh, amgpaghehean mi ye kakahalanan mi kammo. Kaya-bay patawaden mo kayiyna man. Ampakiiingalo kayi kammo a iligtah mo kayi kanlan kalaban mi!>>

BT - The Israelites came-to-be-under-jurisdiction of the Midianiates inside of seven years. And inside those years, the Midianites are the ones getting their harvest. And the Israelitas, because of their fear, they are-hiding in caves in order that they will- not -be-seen by the Midianites. At the end, they asked-mercy again to Apo God, they-say, <<Apo God, we(excl) are-repenting of our(excl) sins to-you. Therefore (you) forgive us(excl) again. We(excl) are-asking-mercy to-you that you save us(excl) from our(excl) enemies!>>

One day, a man named Gideon was secretly harvesting grain so the Midianites would not steal it. The angel of God came to Gideon and said, “God is with you, mighty warrior. Go and save Israel from the Midianites.”

Ha maghay mangaamot, intobol na yan Apo Dioh ye panobolen na a makew ha maghay makpen laki a nagngalan Gideon. Ket ha nalatngan na yan panobolen ye Gideon, ket nakatayo yan ampanggiek ta angkalimo ya kanlan Midian. Hinabi nan panobolen kana, a wana, “Gideon, minged ka. Ta hika ye mak-haw a hondaloh a pinili nan Apo Dioh a māngiligtah kanlan Israelita.”

BT - One day, Apo God sent his sent-one to go to a brave/persevering man who was-named Gideon. And when the sent-one arrived-on Gideon, he was-hiding threshing-[grain] for he is-afraid of the Midians. The sent-one spoke to-him, he-said, <<Gideon, you will-be-gooded. For you are the strong soldier whom Apo God chose to save the Israelites.>>

{{:en:obs:obs-16-06.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


God told Gideon to tear down his father’s idol. Gideon was afraid of the people, so he waited until nighttime. Then he tore down the idol and smashed it to pieces. He built an altar to God where the idol used to be and made a sacrifice to God.

Boy hinabi na po nin panobolen, <<Inhabi nan Apo Dioh a damaen moy andiohen nan bapa mo.>> Noba olibay ha malimo ya kanlan tatao, nagpakadeglem ya. Ket kananyain a madeglem, dinama nan Gideon ye andiohen nan bapa na. Ket tinemek-temek na ya. Pagkayadi, ha babe nin andiohen nan bapa na a dinama na, ket nangipalontoan na yan pangihagpaan nin idigalo kanan Apo Dioh. 

BT - And the sent-one still spoke, <<Apo God said that (you) destroy what your father is-worshipping.>> But because he is afraid to the people, he waited-til-nighttime. And that evening, Gideon destroyed what his father is-worshipping. And he crushed/smashed it. Afterwards, above what his father is-worshipping which he destroyed, he put-on-top a putting-down-place to give-gift to Apo God.

{{:en:obs:obs-16-07.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


The next morning the people saw that the idol had been torn down, and they were very angry. They went to Gideon’s house to kill him, but Gideon’s father said, “Why are you trying to help your gods? If they are gods, let them protect themselves!” So Gideon was saved.


Ha pahanib, nakit lan tatao a nadama ye andiohen la. Kaya-bay napoot hilan tobat. Ket nakew hila ha baey nan Gideon, ta labay la yan pateyen. Noba hinabi nan bapa nin Gideon, a wana kanlan Israelita, “Taket ta anhaglapan yoy dioh? No peteg a dioh ya, paolayan yo man awod a hiyabay ye mamae kanan Gideon.” Kaya-bay oli ha hinabi na, pinaolayan la yan teed. Ha wanabay, naligtah yay Gideon.

BT - The next-morning, people saw that destroyed is what they are-worshipping. So they were very angry. And they went to the house of Gideon, for they wanted to kill him. But the father of Gideon spoke, he-said to the Israelites, <<Why are you helping god? If true that he is god, (you-PL) leave-alone then that he will-take-revenge to Gideon.>> Therefore because of what he said, they then left- him -alone. In like-that, Gideon was-saved.

{{:en:obs:obs-16-08.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Then the Midianites came again to steal from the Israelites. There were so many of them that they could not be counted. Gideon called the Israelites together to fight them. Gideon asked God for two signs so he could be sure that God would use him to save Israel.


Ha ahe maboyot, anti hilay naman ye Midian a mangwa nin popol lan Israelita. Ket hiyay Gideon, hinagyat na hilay Israelita ta pagkahaglap na hilan lomaban kanlan Midian. Noba bayo hilan linomaban, nakikwa yan pagkakitan kanan Apo Dioh, no peteg a hiyabay ye gawien na a māngiligtah kanlan Israelita. 


BT - Not long-time, those Midian are present to get the harvest of the Israelita. And Gideon, he invited the Israelites for he will-help them oppose those from Midian. But before they fought, he asked sign to Apo God, if truly he is the one he will-use as savior to the Israelites.

{{:en:obs:obs-16-09.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


First, he laid a cloth on the ground and asked God to let the morning dew fall only on the cloth and not on the ground. God did that. The next night, he asked that the ground be wet but the cloth dry. God did that too.


Hiyay ona nan dinyag, nangiamlak yan tapih ha lota. Pangayadi, inawok na kanan Apo Dioh, a wana, <<Apo, biyan mo kon pagkakitan no hikoy pinili mo. Ket palobohan mon mabaha nin ambon ye tapih, noba hiyay lota ha palibot nin tapih, adi ana mabaha.>> Ket tinopad nan Apo Dioh ye inawok na. Ha padeglem, nangiamlak yayna man nin tapih ha lota boy hinabi nayna man kanan Apo Dioh, a wana, <<Apo, biyan mo koyna man nin pagkakitan no hikoy peteg a pinili mo. Ket palobohan mo a palibot nin tapih bengat ye mabaha, adi ana mabaha ye tapih.>> Ket tinopad nayna man ye nin Apo Dioh inawok na.

BT - The first that he did, he laid down cloth on the ground. Afterwards, he asked Apo God, he-said, <<Apo, (you) give me sign that I ame the one you chose. And (you) allow to become-wet the cloth by the dew, but the land around the close, don't be-wet.>> And Apo God fulfilled what he requested. At night, he laid-down again the cloth on the ground and he spoke again to Apo God, he-said, <<Apo, (you) give me a sign if I am truly the one you chose. And (you) allow that around the cloth only will-be-wet, not be-wet now the cloth.>> And Apo God fulfilled again what he requested.

{{:en:obs:obs-16-10.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


32,000 Israelite soldiers came to Gideon, but God told him this was too many. So Gideon sent home 22,000 who were too scared to fight. God told Gideon that he still had too many men. So Gideon sent all of them home except for 300 soldiers.


Main 32,000 hondaloh nin Israelita a hinagyat nan Gideon. Noba hinabi nan Apo Dioh kana, a wana, “Hi! Bawahan moy hondaloh mo. Ta malabong hilan tobat.” Ket hiyay Gideon, pinaoli nay 22,000 a hondaloh oli malimo hilan makilaban kanlan Midian. Noba hinabi nayna man nin Apo Dioh kana, a wana, <<Hi, hali po! Bawahan mo po ye hondaloh mo. Ta malabong hila po.>> Kaya-bay pinaoli na hilayna man nin Gideon ye kanayon a hondaloh angga ha tatlon gatoh anan bengat ye napatla.

BT - There were 32,000 soldiers of the Israelitas who Gideon invited. But Apo God said to-him, he-said, <<Hi! (You) lessen your soldiers. For they are very many.>> And Gideon, he sent-home 22,000 soldiers because they were afraid to fight-against those from Midian. But Apo God spoke again to-him, he-said, <<Hi, still [too many]! (You) lessen still your soldiers. For they still are many.>> So Gideon sent-home again other soldiers until 300 only were-left.

{{:en:obs:obs-16-11.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


That night God told Gideon, “Go down to the Midianite camp and when you hear what they say, you will no longer be afraid.” So that night, Gideon went down to the camp and heard a Midianite soldier telling his friend about a dream. The man’s friend said, “This dream means that Gideon will defeat Midian!” Gideon worshiped God.

Kananyatew a madeglem, hinabi nan Apo Dioh kanan Gideon, <<Makew ka ha kampo lan Midian. No malenge moy anhabiyen la, homain kaynan limo.>> Kaya-bay hiyay Gideon, nakew ya ha kampo lan kalaban na ha madeglem. Ket nalateng nay maghay hondaloh a nakaimatan ampangihabi nin taynep na ha maghay hondaloh a kalamo na. Ket hinabi nan kalamo na, <<Hiyay labay habiyen nin taynep mo, hamboten la kitawon Gideon.>> Ket ha nange nan Gideon ye ampaytongtongan lan hohondaloh ha kampo, nanggalang yayna kanan Apo Dioh. 

BT - That night, Apo God spoke to Gideon, <<(You) go to the camp of the Midian. If you will-hear what they are-saying, you have no more fear.>> So Gideon, he went to the camp of his enemies at night. And he arrived-on a soldier who was-awake speaking his dream to a soldier who is his companion. And he spoke to his companion, <<The meaning to say of your dream, Gideon(PL) will-defeat us(incl).>> And when Gideon heard what the soldiers are-talking-about in the camp, he worshipped/praised Apo God.

{{:en:obs:obs-16-12.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Then Gideon returned to his soldiers and gave each of them a horn, a clay pot, and a torch. They surrounded the place where the Midianites were sleeping. The 300 men had the torches in the pots so they could not be seen.

Haanin, nag-odong yaynay Gideon kanlan hohondaloh na, ket binyanan na hilan titimaghan tamboyok, titimaghan banga boy titimaghan pangihagpaan kingki. Ket kananyain a madeglem, legan angkatoloy ye kalaban la, pinalibotan lan Israelita ye kampo lan Midian. Noba hiyay babanga lan Israelita, intalongkop la ha kikingki la ta agya makaimokat hilay Midian, ahe la hila makitan ye Israelita.

BT - Now, Gideon returned already to his soldiers, and he gave them each a trumpet, each a pot and each a putting-place of lamp/fire. And that evening, while their enemies are-sleeping, the Israelites surrounded the camp of the Midian. But the pots of the Israelites, they [used] to-cover-up their lamp/fires for even-though the Midianites will-wake-up, they will- not -see the Israelites.

{{:en:obs:obs-16-13.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Then, at the same time, they all broke the pots that were hiding the torches. They blew their horns and shouted, “A sword for God and for Gideon!”


Ha nayadi lan napalibotan, nayngingidlan hilan namatnoy nin tamboyok haka la pinha ye banga a intalongkop la ha kingki la. Boy impangha la, wanla, <<Yatin kampilan, gawien mi oli ha kalabayan nan Apo Dioh boy kalabayan nan Gideon!>>

BT - When they finished surrounded, at-same-time they made-noise with trumpet and they broke the pot which they [used] to-cover-up their fire/lamps. And they shouted, they-said, <<This sword, we(excl) will-use because of the will/desire of Apo God and the will/desire of Gideon!>>

{{:en:obs:obs-16-14.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


God confused the Midianites, so that they attacked each other and started killing each other. Immediately, the rest of the Israelites were called from their homes to come help chase the Midianites. They killed many of them and chased the rest of them out of their land. 120,000 Midianites died that day. God had saved Israel.


Hiyay Apo Dioh, niyootyoot nay ihip lan Midian. Ket hila met ateed ye naypatey-patey boy nipapayew hilay kanayon. Hilay Israelita, kinamat la hilan pinatey ye nipapayew. Kananyatew a laban, main 120,000 ye natey a kalaban la. Hilay napatla, intaboy la hila ha ilwah nin logal la. Ket ha wanabay, hiyay Apo Dioh ye nangiligtah kanlan Israelita.

BT - Apo God, he made-worried/distressed the minds of the Midianites. And they also killed-each-other and others ran-away-from-each-other. The Israelites, they caught-up-with them and killed the ones running-away. That battle, there were 120,000 who died who were their enemies. Those left, they drove them outside their place. And in like-that, Apo God is the one who saved the Israelites.

{{:en:obs:obs-16-15.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


The people wanted to make Gideon their king. Gideon wisely refused their offer, but he asked them for some of the money that each of them had taken from the enemy. Gideon received a lot of money.

Haanin, hinabi lan Israelita kanan Gideon, <<Labay mi a hika ye mamoon kammi.>>
Noba hinabi nan Gideon kanla, <<Ahe ko labay ye mamoon kanyo. Dakayan yo koynan bengat ha pilak a nahamham yo kanlan kalaban tawo.>> Ket malabong ye pilak boy balitok a indakay la kana. 

Now, the Israelites said to Gideon, <<We(excl) want that you will be the one to rule us(excl).>>
But Gideon spoke to-them, <<I don't want to rule-over you(PL).  (You-PL) just give me a share of the money which you(PL) snatched from our(incl) enemies.>> And many are the money and gold which they shared to-him.

{{:en:obs:obs-16-16.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Then Gideon did a foolish thing. He made an idol with the money, and the people turned away from God again. They started worshiping Gideon’s idol.


Haanin, hiyay Gideon, main yan dinyag a aliwan manged ha pamilew nan Apo Dioh. Ta hiyay pilak boy balitok a natanggap na, ginawi na ha panyag nan diohdiohan. Oli ha dinyag nan Gideon nin diohdiohan, ket tinomalingkokol hilay Israelita kanan Apo Dioh, ta nanowad hila kanan Gideon a manggalang ha diohdiohan na.

BT - Now, Gideon, he has something he did which is not good in the sight of Apo God. For the money and gold which he received, he used in making false-god. Because Gideon made a false-god, the Israelites turned-away-from Apo God, for they imitated Gideon to-honor/worship his false-god.

{{:en:obs:obs-16-17.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


God punished Israel again for worshiping idols. Their enemies defeated them. They finally asked God for help, and God sent them another deliverer. This pattern of sin, punishment, repentance, and deliverance was repeated many times. God sent many deliverers who saved Israel from their enemies.


Oli ha dinyag lan Israelita, nahambot hila kanlan kalaban la, ta padoha la kanan Apo Dioh. Ket nakiingalo hilayna man kanan Apo Dioh, a wanla, <<Apo Dioh, amgpaghehean mi ye kakahalanan mi kammo. Kaya-bay patawaden mo kayiyna man. Ampakiiingalo kayi kammo a iligtah mo kayi kanlan kalaban mi!>> wanlan Israelita. Kaya-bay oli ha paghehe la, nangitobol yayna man ye Apo Dioh nin kanayon a mangiligtah kanlan Israelita. Yatin dinapat-dapat lan Israelita, aliwan bengat minghan, no aliwan mikalabong a okdo boy malabong met a okdo ye pamakikwa lan pamatawad. 

BT - Because of what the Israelites did, they were-defeated by their enemies, for [it is] their punishment [from] Apo God. And they asked-mercy again to Apo God, they-said, <<Apo God, we(excl) are-repenting of our(excl) sins to-you. Therefore (you) forgive us(excl) again. We(excl) are-asking-mercy to-you that you will-save us(excl) from our(excl) enemies!>> said the Israelites. Therefore because of their repenting, Apo God sent again other saviors/deliverers to the Israelites. These actions of the Israelites, not just one-time, but rather many time and and many times is their asking forgiveness.

{{:en:obs:obs-16-18.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Finally, the people asked God for a king like all the other nations had. They wanted a king who was tall, strong, and could lead them into battle. God did not like this request, but He gave them what they wanted.

Ha kapopohan, hinabi lan Israelita kanan Apo Dioh, <<Hilay kaganaan a kalahin tatao ha palibot mi, main hilan poon. Noba hikayi Apo, homain kayin poon. Kaya-bay ampakikwa kayi kammo a byan mo kayi met nin pagpoon mi. Hiyay labay mi a mamoon kammi, matag-ay, mak-haw boy makpen mandawohong ha laban.>>
Hinabi nan Apo Dioh kanla, <<Ahe ko labay ye hinabi yo. Noba agya wanabay man, biyan katawon poon.>>

BT - At the end, the Israelites spoke to Apo God, <<All the races of people in our(excl) surrounding, they have rulers. But we(excl) Apo, we(excl) have no ruler. Therefore we(excl) are-requesting to-you that you give us(excl) also our(excl) ruling [one]. what we(excl) want who will-rule us(excl), tall, strong and persevering to attack in battle.>>
Apo God spoke to-them, <<I don't like what you said. But even-though like-that, I will-give you(PL) a ruler.>>
