\s Things that will happen before Jesus returns
\p
\v 1 Brothers and Sisters, we need to tell you about the day when our Lord Christ Jesus returns, and when God will gather us to welcome Him.
\v 2 Don't be quickly confused or shocked if you hear people talking about that day like this, “Without our knowing, or having an opportunity to meet with other brothers in the faith, the Lord Jesus has already returned.”\f + \fr 2:2 \fk Without our knowing … already returned \ft Literally, “that the day of the Lord has already come.” In the First letter to the Thessalonians, Paul taught concerning “the day of the Lord”— that is the day Jesus returns, that Jesus will take up all Christians, including those who've already died. Everyone will be taken up from the earth to meet Jesus in the clouds of heaven. (See 1 Thes. 4:13-5:11.) So it's most likely that the Thessalonians had answered that letter with this question, “How will we who live far from other Christians hear news about His coming and be ready to meet Jesus?”\f* Don't think like that even if people say, “The Spirit of God has told us this.” Also, don't believe it if people say, “I heard Paul say that the Lord Jesus has already returned.” And if that kind of news comes in a letter, don't believe that the letter came from us.
\v 3 However people may try to deceive you about that matter, don't believe it. For the Lord won't come before the time when many people refuse to follow God. That will happen when they follow a king of wickedness who will just start to take action at that time. He's the one who'll be destroyed on the last day.\f + \fr 2:3 \fk He … who'll be destroyed … \ft Literally, “son of destruction.” The meaning of ‘son of destruction’ is ‘a possession of hell’ or ‘destined for destruction’. (See Dan. 7:24-26.)\f*
\v 4 He'll oppose every being that's worshiped\f + \fr 2:4 \fk every being that's worshiped \ft Meaning any individual who is worshiped, including all false gods, and God Himself. False beings that people worship include idol statues, angels, and even people. At the time Paul was writing, the high king of Rome was also worshipped as a god.\f* by man, including God Himself. He'll raise himself above all of those, to the point that he enters God's Temple and sits in the Holy Place, so that everyone acknowledges that he's God.
\p
\v 5 But why is it that you've forgotten that! When I was with you, I repeatedly told you that.
\v 6 So you should remember that there's another Power\f + \fr 2:6 \fk Power \ft In this verse the word translated ‘Power’ can also be transated ‘something’. But in verse 7 Paul speaks of the same Being/being as ‘singular male’. TSI uses ‘Power’ with a capital letter because it is often interpreted that the Being intended is the Holy Spirit. But there are other interpretations— such as the government or the announcing of the Good News that are hinderances to the king of wickedness.\f* in this world. And now that Power hinders the king of wickedness, so that he can't reveal himself before the time appointed by God arrives.
\v 7 Now that king has already started working secretly in this world, so that people oppose God. But the Power I mentioned will hinder that king until God gives orders to allow that king to work freely.
\v 8 Only then will that king work visibly. After that, the Lord Jesus will come down from heaven in full glory and quickly destroy him with just His word.
\p
\v 9 When that king reveals himself, he'll work all kinds of miracles with the power of the devil, so that people will think that he's God.
\v 10 And he'll use all kinds of tricks to mislead the people who are following the road to destruction. They'll be destroyed because they close their hearts to the true teaching that could save them.
\v 11 For that reason, God will blind the eyes of their hearts, so that they'll keep believing that false teaching.
\v 12 God will do that so that everyone who keeps enjoying evil and refuses to believe in true teaching will be punished by Him.
\s We who believe must endure
\p
\v 13 But Brothers and Sisters whom the Lord Jesus loves, of course we should always give thanks to God, because He has chosen you since the creation of the world. He chose you to be saved through believing in the true teaching, and through God's Spirit who purifies you.
\v 14 In that way, God used the Good News which we gave in order to call you, so that you take part with us in the glory of our Lord Christ Jesus.
\v 15 For that reason Brothers and Sisters, endure and keep holding onto the teachings that we gave— both verbally and by letter.
\p
\v 16 For that reason, we pray to our Lord Christ Jesus, and to God our Father for you. God the Father really loves us, and always encourages our hearts so that we are more certain\f + \fr 2:16 \fk more certain \ft Literally, “good hope.” Hope in the New Testament is more like certainty, because it has a strong basis.\f* about living forever with the Lord. We have that certainty because Jesus has been very kind to us.
\v 17 So we pray that the Lord Jesus, and God the Father always encourage each of your hearts. That way, you will always do what is best— through words and actions.
