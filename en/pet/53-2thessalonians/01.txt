\v 1 Dear Brothers and Sisters in the faith in the congregation at Thessalonica— that is you who've been made one with God our Father and our Lord Christ Jesus.
\p Greetings from Paul, Silas\f + \fr 1:1 \fk Silas \ft Literally, “Silvanus.”\f* and Timothy.
\p
\v 2 My prayer is that God the Father, and the Lord Christ Jesus will always be kind to each of you, and watch over you so that you live calmly under God’s protection!
\s Paul comforts the congregation in persecution
\p
\v 3 We always give thanks to God because of you, Brothers and Sisters. And we feel it's very proper to do that, because your faith in Jesus keeps growing, and you all love each other more and more.
\v 4 So we're always glad to tell about you to other churches, that is those who like you and us are chosen by God. We tell them how you keep enduring and holding on to your faith when you're persecuted and suffer many things.
\p
\v 5 The way you endure like that proves that God is always just to man, so that you're considered worthy to enter God's kingdom. For you're suffering now, of course, because you're faithful to His kingdom.
\v 6 When God gives a harsh punishment to those who are making you suffer now, He'll also do it with justice.
\v 7 At that time, He'll also give a feeling of relief to you who are suffering, and to us also. This will happen when the Lord Jesus returns from heaven and shows Himself again to this world. At that time, His angels will accompany Him with amazing power.
\v 8 And everyone who doesn't know God and doesn't want to obey the Good News about our Lord Jesus will be punished by Him with flaming fire.\f + \fr 1:8 \fk everyone who doesn't know … flaming fire \ft Paul writes words that are almost the same as Ps. 79:6; Is. 66:15; and Jer. 10:25.\f*
\v 9 They'll be punished forever in a place that's far from the presence of the Lord, and they won't be able to enjoy the glory of God and all of His power forever.\f + \fr 1:9 \fk in a place that's far … all His power \ft Paul writes words that are almost the same as Is. 2:10, 19.\f*
\v 10 That punishment will happen when the Lord Jesus comes back. At that time, everyone who has been purified by Him— that is everyone who believes in Him, will feel amazed, and glorify Him because of His power. Certaily you will also join in welcoming His coming because you've believed the testimony that we've given.
\p
\v 11 For that reason, we always pray for you. And we ask God to help you to live in a way that's proper for people who've been called by Him. And we pray that through the power of God, He'll enable you to complete all the good things that you desire to do— especially the good things that are proper for us who believe in Jesus.
\v 12 In that way, the name of Jesus— our Lord, will be glorified through each of your lives. And because you're one with Him, you'll also be honored according to the kindness of God the Father and our Lord Christ Jesus.
