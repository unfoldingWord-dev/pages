\c 9
\s Jesus makes a blind man see
\p
\v 1 When we, His disciples, were walking along with Jesus, we all saw a man who had been blind since birth.
\v 2 Then we asked, “Teacher, who do you suppose sinned so that he was born blind? Was it because of his own sin while he was still in his mother's womb, or because of the sin of his mother and father?”
\p
\v 3 Then Jesus answered, “He wasn't born blind because of his sin, and it also wasn't because of his mother or father's sin. But this happened so that through him the power of God can be shown to many people.
\v 4-5 As long as I'm still in this world, I am the light of the world. So now while it's still day, we must do the various tasks given by the Father who sent Me. For night will fall soon, and there won't be anyone who'll be able to do anything anymore.”
\p
\v 6 After Jesus said that, He spit on the ground and mixed His spit with dirt to make mud, then He rubbed it on the eyelids of the blind man.
\v 7 Then He said, “Go to the pool of Siloam and wash your eyes there.” (In the Hebrew language, 'Siloam' means 'Sent'.) So the man went to wash his eyes at the pool. When he came back, he could see.
\p
\v 8 After he returned, his neighbors and the people who had seen him begging before this said to each other, “Isn't he the blind man who usually sits and begs for money?!”
\p
\v 9 Some answered, “Yes, that's definitely him.” But others said, “No, he just looks like that blind man.”
\p Then he said, “It's true, I'm the man who used to be blind!”
\p
\v 10 Because of that they asked him, “How were you made able to see?”
\p
\v 11 He answered, “The man named Jesus mixed his spit with dirt till it became mud, then he rubbed it on my eyelids. And then he told me to go wash my eyes in the pool of Siloam. So I went. After I washed my eyes, I could see.”
\p
\v 12 Then they asked him again, “Where is that man?”
\p And he answered, “I don't know.”
\s The Pharisee group check whether the former blind man was blind from birth
\p
\v 13 Then those people took the former blind man to members of the Pharisee group,
\v 14 because the day when Jesus made mud and made the blind man see was the Sabbath Day.
\v 15 So the Pharisees also asked him, “How were you made able to see?”
\p Then the man answered, “Jesus rubbed mud on my eyelids, then I went and washed my eyes, and now I can see.”
\p
\v 16 Then some of the Pharisees said, “It isn't possible that Jesus was sent by God, because he doesn't obey the regulations of the Law about the Sabbath Day.”
\p But some other members said, “A sinner couldn't possibly do a miracle like this!” So there was a huge difference of opinion between them.
\p
\v 17 Then they asked the man again, “You're the blind man whom he made able to see. So what's your opinion about that man?”
\p The former blind man answered, “He's a prophet.”
\p
\v 18 But they still didn't believe that he really used to be blind and could now see. Because of that they called his mother and father.
\v 19 Then they asked his parents, “This is your son— right?! Was he really blind since birth? If so, how can it be that he can see now?”
\p
\v 20 His parents answered, “It's true that he's our son. He truly was blind from birth.
\v 21 But we don't know how it happened that he can see now, and we don't know who made his eyes able to see. Go ahead and ask him. He's an adult, and he can answer himself.”
\v 22 His father and mother said that to the Pharisees because they were afraid of being punished— that they could be forbidden to enter any Jewish synagogue. Because prior to this, the Jewish leaders had already agreed that anyone who confessed that Jesus was the Christ would be forbidden to enter any synagogue.\f + \fr 9:22 \fk synagogue \ft See the footnote in John 6:59. If someone was forbidden to enter the synagogue, he was also shunned by everyone.\f*
\v 23 That's why his parents said, “Go ahead and ask him. He's an adult, and he can answer himself.”
\p
\v 24 So, for the second time the Pharisees called the former blind man and said to him, “Swear before God that you'll tell us the truth, because we know that Jesus is a sinner!”
\p
\v 25 Then he answered, “I don't know whether he's a sinner or not. What I do know is this: I was blind, but now I can see!”
\p
\v 26 Then they asked, “What did he do to you? How did he make your eyes able to see?”
\p
\v 27 And he answered, “I just explained that to you, but you didn't pay attention! Why do you want to hear it again?! Don't tell me that you want to become his followers too!”
\p
\v 28 Then they insulted him by saying, “You're a follower of that sinner— not us! We're followers of Moses.
\v 29 We know that God has spoken to Moses, but we don't know anything about that man!”
\p
\v 30 Then the former blind man said to them, “Wow, that's really strange! You say that you don't know anything about Jesus, even though he made my eyes able to see.
\v 31 We know that God never listens to the requests of sinners, but He listens to everyone who honors Him and does His will.
\v 32 From the beginning of the world until now, we've never heard that anyone was able to make the eyes of a person born blind able to see.
\v 33 If that man wasn't sent by God, he couldn't possibly do a miracle like this!”
\p
\v 34 So they said to him, “From the moment you were born you were full of sin. That's why you were blind! And now you think you're good enough to teach us— huh?!” And from then on, he was forbidden to enter any synagogue.
\s Don't let the eyes of your hearts be blind
\p
\v 35 When Jesus heard that the former blind man was forbidden to enter any of the synagogues, He looked for him. And when He met him, Jesus asked, “Do you believe in the Son of Man?”
\p
\v 36 Then the man answered, “Sir, who is He? Tell me so that I can believe in Him!”
\p
\v 37 Then Jesus said, “You've already seen Him. Actually, I'm the Son of Man— the One sent by God into this world, and who's now speaking to you.”
\p
\v 38 The man answered, “I believe, Lord!” Then he knelt and worshiped Him.
\p
\v 39 Then Jesus said, “I came to this world to make a division among mankind. Those who are blind will see, and those who consider themselves able to see will become blind.”
\p
\v 40 There were some members of the Pharisee group there who heard what Jesus said. They said to Him, “So you mean we're blind— huh?!”
\p
\v 41 And Jesus answered, “If you each would admit that you're blind, it would mean that you would not now be sinning. But since you keep saying that you can see, you keep on adding to your sins.”
