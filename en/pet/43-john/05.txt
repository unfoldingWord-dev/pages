\s Jesus heals a sick man at the pool of Bethesda
\p
\v 1 After that, Jesus went to Jerusalem to take part in one of the Jewish celebrations.
\v 2 There was a pool in Jerusalem. Around the pool were five courtyards. In the Hebrew language that pool was called Bethesda.\f + \fr 5:2 \fr Bethesda \ft means “house of compassion.” In some other ancient manuscripts of this Gospel, the pool is also named Bethsaida or Bethzatha. The pool was located to the north of God's Temple in Jerusalem.\f* The pool is located near the gate entering the city, named the “Sheep's Gate.”
\v 3 Many sick people were lying in the courtyards, including people who were blind, lame, and paralyzed. [\f + \fr 5:3 \fk Brackets like this [ … ] \ft show that the words in the brackets evidently weren't written by John. An ancient copier of John's Gospel added these words to explain why sick people waited at the pool.\f* They were waiting for the pool water to be stirred,
\v 4 because from time to time an angel came down and stirred the water. The moment that happened, the first person who entered the pool would be healed from his sickness. ]
\v 5-6 There was also a man lying there who'd been sick for thirty eight years. When Jesus saw him, Jesus knew that this man had been sick for a very long time. So He asked him, “Do you want to be healed?”
\p
\v 7 The sick man answered, “Sir, when the water starts to stir, there isn't anyone who can help lower me into the pool. But when I try to enter quickly, someone else goes down ahead of me.”
\p
\v 8 Then Jesus said to him, “Stand up! Pick up your mat and walk.”
\v 9 At that very moment the man was healed! Then he picked up his mat and walked.
\p That healing happened on the Sabbath day.
\v 10 Because of that, several of the Jewish leaders said to the man who had been healed, “This is the Sabbath Day— right! According to our regulations, you aren't allowed to carry your mat on the Sabbath day.”
\p
\v 11 But he answered, “The man who healed me is the one who ordered me, ‘Pick up your mat and walk.’”
\p
\v 12 Then they asked, “Who ordered you to do that?”
\p
\v 13 But the man who was recently healed didn't know the Person who healed him. For there were many people in that place, and Jesus left there quickly in a secret way.
\p
\v 14 Some time later, in one of the courtyards of God's Temple, Jesus met that man and said to him, “Now you're well. Stop sinning, so that something worse doesn't happen to you again.”
\p
\v 15 Then the man went back to the Jewish leaders and said, “The person who healed me is named Jesus.”
\p
\v 16 Jesus healed that man on the Sabbath Day. For that reason the Jewish leaders started to make trouble for Him.
\v 17 But He said to them, “My Father works all of the time, and I always work like He does.”
\p
\v 18 That answer made them even angrier, so they looked for a way to kill Him. For according to them, He had broken the regulation of Moses regarding the Sabbath Day, and He also said that God was His Father. That meant He made Himself the same as God.
\s God's Son possesses the authority of God
\p
\v 19 Because they were angry like that, Jesus said to them, “What I'm saying is really true. I— as the Son of My Father, can't do anything based on My own will, but I do what My Father is doing. What I see My Father do, that's what I do too.
\v 20-21 My Father makes people come alive from death. In the same way, I give life to whomever I want to. My Father loves Me. That's why He shows Me everything that He does. And the Father will involve Me in even greater things, so that you'll be amazed.
\p
\v 22 “My Father doesn't punish anyone, but He has surrendered all of that work to Me.
\v 23 The Father has determined that, so that everyone honors Me, just like they honor Him. If people don't honor Me, they don't honor My Father who sent Me into this world either.
\p
\v 24 “What I'm saying is really true. Everyone who follows what I say, and believes in the Father who sent Me, already has eternal life. God won't punish them, because they've been freed from the power of death and moved into the group of people who live forever.
\v 25 Believe this: the time will come and actually has already begun— when people who have died will hear the voice of God's Son, that is My voice, and they'll live.
\v 26 That happens because My Father is the source of life, and He has given authority to Me to give life to mankind.
\v 27 My Father has also given authority to Me to judge mankind, because I'm the Son of Man.\f + \fr 5:27 \fk Son of Man \ft See the note in John. 1:51.\f*
\p
\v 28 “What's even more amazing is this: The time will come when all the dead people who are in their graves will hear the voice of the Son of Man— namely Me.
\v 29 Then they will all rise and leave their own graves. Those who have lived right will get eternal life, but I will punish those who've lived in wickedness.
\p
\v 30 “I will judge with justice, because I can't do anything according to My own will. I just judge according to what I've heard from My Father. The punishment that I give is definitely just, because I don't follow My own will, but I always follow the will of the Father who sent Me into this world.”
\s Jesus speaks with the Jewish leaders
\p
\v 31 “If I alone testify about Myself, and there's no one else who supports what I say, then you won't accept my testimony.
\v 32 But there is another Person who testifies about Me— namely My Father. And I know that His testimony about Me is true.
\p
\v 33 “You'd ordered some people to go to John the Baptist to ask about Me. And everything that John said about Me was true.
\v 34 Actually, I don't need help from people to testify about Me. I'm just reminding you about what John said so that you can be saved.
\v 35 While John lived among you, he was like a lamp that burned and gleamed. And for just a short time you certainly enjoyed his light and received his testimony about Me.
\p
\v 36 “But what's more important than John's testimony is all that I do in your midst, because all that My Father gives Me to do proves that He has sent Me into this world.
\v 37 And the Father who sent Me is Himself the one who gives testimony about Me directly to mankind. But you've never heard His voice and have never seen His face either.
\v 38 You can't accept what He says, because you don't want to believe in Me, who was sent by Him.
\v 39 You like to study from the Holy Bible, because you think that by doing that you'll get eternal life. But it's those very books of God's Word that give testimony about Me.
\v 40 Even so, you don't want to come to Me to learn how to receive that life.
\p
\v 41 “I don't seek the praise of men.
\v 42 But I know your hearts— that is I know that you don't love God.
\v 43 I've come from My Father to represent Him. But you don't accept Me. However, if someone else comes and brings teaching in his own name, you'll gladly accept him.
\v 44 That's because you're happy to seek praise from your fellow man alone, but you've never sought the praise of the one and only God. Since that's so, how can you believe in Me?
\v 45 Don't think that I will stand before the Father and speak about your wrong doings. Moses— the one you hope will defend you, is the one who will do that!
\v 46 If you believed what Moses said, you should also believe what I say, because he wrote about Me.\x + Gen. 3:15, Num. 18:14-22.\x*
\v 47 But if you don't believe in what Moses has written, it isn't possible for you to believe in what I say.”
