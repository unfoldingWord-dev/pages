\s Jesus and Nicodemus
\p
\v 1-2 There was a man named Nicodemus who came to Jesus one night. He was a member of the Jewish religious group called the Pharisees, and he was also one of the leaders of that religion. He said to Jesus, “Teacher, we know that you were sent by God to teach us, because without God's help no one can do miracles like you're doing.”\f + \fr 3:2 \fk You \fk In this verse and in verse 10, the Indonesian word “Father/Sir” is used because it's natural in a conversation between Jesus and Nikodemus. A capital letter is always used when “Father” is used (in Indonesian) to mean “you.” So in this verse, the word “Father/Sir” isn't showing that Nikodemus understood or believed that Jesus is the Son of God.\f*
\p
\v 3 Then Jesus answered him, “What I'm telling you is very true: No one can become a citizen of God's kingdom\f + \fr 3:3 \fk God's kingdom \fk is the “rule of God” over everyone who obeys Him. Just as Jesus obeyed the will of God to the point of surrendering Himself as a sacrificial offering, so each of God's people also have to surrender themselves to follow His will (Mark 8:34; Rom. 10:9-10, 12:1-2). In that way, we prove that we've become citizens of God's kingdom, and are worthy to receive everything God has promised to His chosen people from the beginning. When Jesus returns, God will rule in reality on this earth— just as God always rules in heaven. See Dan. 7:13-14, Matt. 6:10\f* if he isn't born again.”\f + \fr 3:3 \fr born again \fr It could mean ‘born again through one's mother’, like what Nicodemus understood. But these words can also mean, ‘born from above’. The meaning of ‘from above’ is from heaven.\f*
\p
\v 4 Then Nicodemus asked, “How is it possible for a person to be born again if he's already an adult? It isn't possible for him to enter into his mother's womb again and be born another time!”
\p
\v 5 Jesus answered him, “I'm telling you what's really true: Everyone who desires to become a citizen of God's kingdom must be born of water and of the Holy Spirit. If not, he can't become a citizen of God's kingdom.
\v 6 A person is born physically because of his parents, of course, but a person must be born spiritually from the Holy Spirit.
\v 7 Don't be amazed because I say, ‘All of you must be born again.’
\v 8 For birth by the Holy Spirit is like the moving of the wind which blows everywhere. We can only hear its sound, but we don't know where the wind comes from, or where the wind is going. It's the same as the work of the Holy Spirit in the hearts of mankind.”
\p
\v 9 Then Nicodemus asked again, “How can these things possibly happen?”
\p
\v 10 Jesus answered him, “How did you become a religious teacher for the Israelites if you don't understand these things?!
\v 11 What I'm telling you is really true. My disciples and I teach about things which we already know. And we testify about what we've already seen, but you don't accept our testimony.
\v 12 You obviously don't believe when I teach about earthly things, so how can you possibly believe if I teach about heavenly things?!
\v 13 No one has ever gone up to heaven and come down again so that he could teach you about heavenly things. Only I— the Son of Man, am fit to teach about those things, because only I have come down from there.
\p
\v 14 “When our forefathers were in the desert, a carving of a snake was hung by Moses on top of a wooden post.\f + \fr 3:14 \fr carving of a snake \fr This happened at the time the people of Israel sinned and God punished them so that they were bitten by poisonous snakes. Then God told Moses to place a snake carved from brass on a wooden post, so that everyone who looked at the snake was healed from the poisonous snake bites. (Num. 21:4-9)\f* In the same way, I— the Son of Man, have to be hung up on a wooden post,
\v 15 so that everyone who believes in Me will receive eternal life.”\f + \fr 3:15 \fr the last quotation mark \fr Most interpreters think that the words of Jesus to Nicodemus ended in verse 15, but there are also those who think that the quote continues until verse 21.\f*
\p 16 17 For God sent His Son into this world— not to punish mankind, but so that through Him mankind could be saved.
\v 18 Everyone who believes in the Son of God won't be punsihed by God. But everyone who doesn't believe like that is already under the punishment of God, because they don't believe in the one and only Son of God.
\v 19 This is the basis of that punishment: Light from heaven has come to this world, but people are happier to live in darkness, rather than live in light, because their deeds are evil.
\v 20 Everyone who does evil hates the light. They don't want to come to the light, because that light will make all of their evil deeds visible.
\v 21 But everyone who follows the right way will come to the light, so that it's seen that they do right deeds with the help of God.
\s Jesus and John the Baptist
\p
\v 22 After this, Jesus went together with us, His disciples, to the province of Judea. He stayed there with us for some time, and baptized many people.
\v 23-24 At that time, John hadn't been put in prison yet. He also baptized the people who came to him at Aenon— which is located near Salim, because there was a lot of water there.
\p
\v 25 Then an argument came up between John's followers and other Jewish people about the requirements of cleansing one's self according to the Jewish custom.\f + \fr 3:25 \fr rituals of cleansing … Jewish custom \fr See the note in John 2:6.\f*
\v 26 So they came and said to John, “Teacher, do you remember the man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan River, the one whom you testified about? The problem is that he's also baptizing now, and almost everyone is going to him.”
\p
\v 27 Then John answered them, “We humans only receive what God gives us.
\v 28 You yourselves heard when I said, ‘I'm not the Christ who was promised, but I was sent by God just to prepare the way for Him.’
\v 29 Jesus and I have a relationship like a groom and his close friend. At the time of the wedding, the bride will be taken to the house of the groom. The friend of the groom witnesses this and shares in his happiness.\f + \fr 3:29 \fr witnesses … happiness \fr Literally, 'happy because of (hearing) the voice of the groom.”\f* In the same way, I feel very happy for all that God is giving Jesus now.
\v 30 He must become greater, but I must become less.”
\s He who comes from heaven
\p
\v 31 We who come from the world are only able to think and speak of earthly things. But He who came from heaven isn't like that, because He who came from above is greater than everyone.
\v 32 He testifies about the things that He has seen and heard in heaven, but only a few people accept His testimony.
\v 33 But everyone who accepts His testimony confesses that the news which He delivers is very worthy to be believed, because it comes from God.
\v 34 And we know that this news is true, because He, who was sent by God into this world, truly delivers teaching from God Himself. And it's clear that God gives His Spirit completely to Him.
\v 35 God loves His Son and has surrendered everything into His hand.
\v 36 For that reason, everyone who belieeves in God's Son already has eternal life. But everyone who doesn't obey the Son of God won't have eternal life. Instead, they'll experience the wrath of God continually.
