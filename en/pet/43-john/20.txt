\s The resurrection of Jesus
\r (Matt. 28:1-10; Mark 16:1-8; Luke 24:1-12)
\p
\v 1 When it was still dark on Sunday morning, Mary— the one who came from the village of Magdala, went to Jesus' tomb. When she got there, she saw that the large stone closing the hole in the rock had been moved.
\v 2 Then she ran to meet Peter who was also called Simon, and me also— namely the disciple whom Jesus truly loved. And Mary said to us, “People have taken the body of the Lord from His tomb, and we don't know where they've put it!”
\p
\v 3 Then the two of us ran quickly to the tomb.
\v 4 We both ran, but I ran faster than Peter, so I got there first.
\v 5 So I bent down and looked into the tomb, but I could only see the cloth that was used to wrap the body of Jesus. At that time, I didn't go inside.
\v 6 As soon as Peter arrived, he went inside and saw where the cloth was placed.
\v 7 He also saw the cloth which was used to wrap Jesus' head. That cloth was folded, and placed separately from the long cloth which was used to wrap His body.
\v 8 Then I also went and saw all of that. And at that moment, I began to believe that Jesus had come back to life from death.
\p
\v 9 (At that time, we didn't yet understand that Jesus was appointed to live again after dying— according to what was written in the Holy Bible.)
\s Jesus shows Himself to Mary who was from the village of Magdala
\r (Mark 16:9-11)
\p
\v 10 Then the two of us returned to our homes again.
\v 11 But Mary still stood outside the tomb and cried. As she was crying, she bent down and looked inside the tomb.
\v 12 Then she saw two angels wearing white clothes, sitting in the place where Jesus body had been placed. One angel sat at the head and the other sat at the foot.
\p
\v 13 The two angels asked her, “Why are you crying, Ma'am?”
\p And she answered, “People have taken the body of my Lord, and I don't know where they've put it.”
\v 14 After saying that, she turned and saw Jesus standing there. But she didn't recognize Him.
\p
\v 15 Then Jesus said to her, “Why are you crying, Ma'am? Who're you looking for?”
\p Mary thought that the Man who asked this was the gardener.” So she answered, “Sir, if you're the one who took His body, please tell me where you put it, so I can bury him again.”
\p
\v 16 Then Jesus said to her, “Mary!”
\p And Mary turned around to Him again and said, “Rabboni!” (That word is from the Hebrew language. It means “Teacher.”)
\p
\v 17 And Jesus said to her, “Don't keep holding on to Me, because I haven't yet returned to our Father. But go to My close friends\f + \fr 20:17 \fr My close friends \ft Literally, “My brothers.”\f* and tell them that I'm leaving to go to our Father,\f + \fr 20:17 \fk our \ft Literally, “My Father and Your Father.”\f*who's also our God.”
\p
\v 18 Then Mary went to meet us disciples of Jesus, and told us this, “I've seen the Lord!” And Mary also told us what Jesus had told her.
\s Jesus shows Himself to His disciples
\r (Matt. 28:16-20; Mark 16:14-18; Luke 24:36-49)
\p
\v 19 That Sunday night, we disciples of Jesus, and several other followers, gathered in one house. We had locked all the doors, because we were afraid of the Jewish leaders. Suddenly Jesus appeared and stood in our midst, and greeted us saying, “May you feel calm at heart!”\f + \fr 20:19 \fk greeted them … \ft Jesus literally said two words in Greek which can be translated, “Peace to you.” It's quite possible that Jesus used the Hebrew language when He gave this greeting— which is 'Shalom'. In the Hebrew language, 'Shalom' is the usual word of greeting, and is frequently used every day. But in this situation, of course, it's quite possible that Jesus also meant it according to the root meaning of that saying— which is calmness of heart.\f*
\v 20 After saying that, He showed His hands and side to all of us who were there. The moment we saw Him, we were all very joyful.
\p
\v 21 Then Jesus said to all of us again, “May you feel calm at heart. Just as the Father sent Me, so as of now I'm sending you.”
\v 22 After saying that, He blew His breath on us and said, “Receive the Holy Spirit.
\v 23 Through His help you'll tell the news of forgiveness to other people. So if you feel it's God's will to forgive another person's sin, then I and My Father also forgive him. But if you don't forgive another person's sin, then God and I won't forgive them either.”
\s Jesus shows Himself to Thomas
\p
\v 24 But Jesus' disciple named Thomas— who was usually called ‘the Twin’, wasn't with us when Jesus showed Himself to us.
\v 25 When Thomas came, we told him, “We've seen the Lord!” But he answered, “I won't believe until I see the scars of the nail wounds in His two hands and put my finger into the scar wounds from those big nails, and put my hand into the scar of the spear wound in His side too.”
\p
\v 26 After one week had passed,\f + \fr 20:26 \fr one week \ft Literally, “eight days.” In the way the Jews counted, the first and last day were both counted.\f* we gathered in that house again. Thomas was with us too. Like before, even though the doors were locked, Jesus suddenly appeared and stood in our midst. Then He said, “May you feel calm at heart!”
\v 27 Then He said to Thomas, “Come, see My hands and put your finger here. And put your hand into the scar of the spear wound in My side. Don't doubt any more, but really believe.”
\p
\v 28 Then Thomas answered, “Oh, You're my Lord and my God!”
\p
\v 29 Then Jesus said to him, “You just now believe because you've seen Me, but God will truly bless everyone who believes in Me, even though he hasn't yet seen Me.”
\s The reason John wrote this book
\p
\v 30 Actually, many other miracles were done by Jesus in our presence, but they aren't written in this book.
\v 31 But all these were written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ and God's Son, and that through believing this, you will become one with Jesus and receive eternal life.
