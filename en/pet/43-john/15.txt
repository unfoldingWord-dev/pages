\c 15
\s Jesus is the grapevine
\p
\v 1 Then Jesus said to us disciples of His, “I'm like a grapevine that truly produces fruit according to God's will, and My Father is like the gardener who takes care of that grapevine.
\v 2 He always trims off all of My branches which don't produce fruit. And He reduces the number of leaves on each branch that's bearing fruit, so that their fruit\f + \fr 15:2 \fk increases even more \ft Because the point here is actually people, and not vines that bear fruit, it means to live in a way that shows they are owned by Jesus. Included in this way of life is 1) “The fruit and proof that the Holy Spirit is involved in our lives”— which is found in Gal. 5:22-23. (See also Eph. 5:9; Heb. 12:11; Jam. 3:18.) 2) ‘Harvesting spiritual wheat’— which is to win souls so that their lives are also changed, and they obtain salvation which is eternal, as Jesus explained in John 4:34-38 and John 15:16. Jesus gave Himself for that, as is shown in John 12:24.\f* increases even more.
\v 3 You are each definitely ready to produce fruit because of the teaching which I've given you.
\v 4 You should continue to live in oneness with Me, and I will also continue to live in oneness with you. Just like a branch can't produce fruit if it lives apart from its vine, it's the same with you. If you don't live in oneness with Me, you won't be able to produce fruit.
\p
\v 5 “I'm definitely like a grape vine, and you're like My branches. If you continue to live in oneness with Me, and I keep living in oneness with you, then you'll produce much fruit. But if you're separated from Me, you won't be able to do anything.
\v 6 Everyone who lives separated from Me is like the branches of the vine which are thrown out and become dry. Those branches will be gathered, then thrown into the fire and burned.
\v 7 If you keep living in oneness with Me, and My teaching lives in your hearts, you may ask for whatever you need, then it will be given to you.
\v 8 My father will be glorified if you produce much fruit. That also shows that you really are My disciples.
\p
\v 9 “Just as the Father always loves Me, so I always love you too. You should keep living like people that I love.
\v 10 Keep obeying My commands, and I will keep loving you too. In the same way, My Father keeps loving Me, because I always obey His commands.
\v 11 I've told you all of this so that you can share in feeling My joy, and so that there's nothing lacking in your joy.
\v 12 This is the command I'm giving you: You should love each other, just like I've loved you.
\v 13 The proof that a person has the most amazing love is if he's willing to sacrifice himself in order to save his close friends.
\p
\v 14 “You'll be proven to be My close friends if you do what I command you.
\v 15 Now I won't call you My servants anymore, because servants don't know the plans of their master. But I call you My close friends, because I've told you everything that the Father told Me.
\v 16 It wasn't you who chose to become My disciples, but I chose you for that task. And this is why I appointed you: So that you'll go to My field and produce much spiritual fruit. And what you produce will last for eternity. Because you carry out that task, whatever you ask of God the Father in order to glorify Me, then He'll give it to you.
\v 17 So I repeat this command: You should love each other.”
\s The people of this world will hate you
\p
\v 18 “When the people of the world hate you, remember that they hated Me long before that.
\v 19 If you were still of the same mind as the people of the world, they would certainly be happy with you, because you would still be on the same side as them. But you're no longer on their side, because I've chosen you from among them. That's why they hate you.
\v 20 Remember what I've said to you before: A servant is not honored more than his master. The people of this world have hurt Me, so they'll certainly hurt you too. Only a few people have obeyed My teaching, so the same number of people will obey when you tell My teaching to them.
\v 21 They'll do all of that to you because you belong to Me, and because they don't know the Father who has sent Me either.
\v 22 If I had never come and had never taught those who reject Me and My teaching, they wouldn't yet have had opportunity to sin like that. But now I've told the teaching from God. So on the last day of this world, when everyone is judged for their sins, none of them will have an excuse to say, ‘I didn't know the true way.’
\v 23 People who hate Me also hate My Father.
\v 24 They've witnessed the miracles that I've done, which no one else has ever done. If I'd never done those miracles, they would definitely have a reason not to receive Me. But now they've witnessed all of My miracles, and they still hate Me and My Father too.
\v 25 But this happened in order to fulfill what was written about Me in God's Word, ‘They hated Me without a reason.’\x + Ps. 35:19, 69:5\x*
\p
\v 26 “Later, when I'm with My Father, We'll send the Helper Spirit to you. He's the Spirit of Truth, who'll teach true things to you. And when He comes, He'll testify about Me to everyone in this world.
\v 27 And you'll also testify about Me, because you've been with Me from the beginning of My ministry.”
