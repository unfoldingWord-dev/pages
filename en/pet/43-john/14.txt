\c 14
\s Jesus is the true way leading to the Father
\p
\v 1 Then Jesus said to us disciples of His, “Don't be troubled in your hearts. Keep believing in God, and in Me too.
\v 2 There are many places to live in My Father's house, and I'm going ahead to prepare a place for you to live there. If that weren't true, I would never promise you that.
\v 3 When I've gone to my Father's house and the place is ready for you, I will come back again and take you to that place— so that where I am, you'll be there too.
\v 4 And you know the way to the place where I'm going.
\p
\v 5 Then Thomas said to Him, “Lord, we don't know where You're going yet. So how do we know the way there?”
\p
\v 6 Then Jesus answered, “I am the way leading to the Father, and the basis of all true teaching, and the One who gives eternal life. No one can come to the Father except through Me.
\v 7 If you have really known Me, you would also know My Father. But you actually have known Him now, and have seen Him.”
\p
\v 8 Then Philip said to Jesus, “Lord, if that's so, show us Your Father, so that our hearts are satisfied.”
\p
\v 9 Then Jesus answered, “Haven't I already been with you for a long time? So you should already have known Me, Philip! A person who has seen Me has seen My Father. So why do you still say, ‘Show us Your Father’?
\v 10 Don't you yet believe that I'm one with My Father, and My Father is also one with Me? What I teach doesn't come from Myself, but the Father is united with Me to do all that work.
\v 11 Believe that I'm one with the Father, and the Father is one with Me. If you don't believe My words, believe in Me because you've seen the miracles that I've done.
\v 12 What I'm saying is really true: Everyone who believes in Me will do miracles like I've done. And not just that, but they'll also do various miracles that are greater than those I do, because I'm going to My Father soon.
\v 13 And whatever you ask for in prayer so that I\f + \fr 14:13-14 \fk I \ft Literally, “My name.” According to Jewish culture at the time of Jesus, “My name” meant the whole identity of Christ Jesus.\f* am glorified, I will answer that prayer of yours. In that way, My Father will be glorified though Me, His Son.
\v 14 Yes, I will give you whatever you ask of Me, so that I'm glorified.”
\s Jesus promises to give the Helper Spirit
\p
\v 15 “If you love Me, you'll follow all of My commands.
\v 16 Then I will ask the Father to give you another Helper\f + \fr 14:16 \fr Helper \ft Can also be translated “Comforter” or “Companion.”\f* to be with you and help you forever.
\v 17 That Helper is the Spirit of Truth,\f + \fr 14:17 \fr Spirit of Truth \ft Is the same as God's Spirit. According to the following verses, He's no different than the Spirit of Jesus, either. See John 15:26 and 16:13.\f* who will teach you true things that. But the people of the world can't accept Him, because they don't see Him or know Him. But you know Him, because He's with you now, and later He'll live in each of your hearts.
\p
\v 18 “I won't leave you alone. I will come back to you.
\v 19 In a just little while, the people of the world won't see Me anymore, but you'll see Me. Because I live, you'll live too.
\v 20 At that time, you'll know that I'm one with My Father, I'm one with you, and you're one with Me.
\v 21 Everyone who really loves Me will definitely follow My commands. And people like that are the ones who are loved by My Father. I will also love him, and will reveal Myself to him.”
\p
\v 22 Then one of the disciples named Judas— who wasn't from the village of Cariot, asked Jesus, “Lord, why do You reveal Yourself to us, and you don't reveal yourself to the people of the world?”
\p
\v 23 Then Jesus answered, “Everyone who loves Me will follow My teaching. My Father will love him. So My Father and I will come to him and live in him.
\v 24 But anyone who doesn't love Me, doesn't follow My teaching either. Remember: This teaching didn't come from Me, but from the Father who sent Me.
\p
\v 25 “I've said all of this while I'm still with you.
\v 26 But the Helper— who is the Holy Spirit, will be sent by the Father so that I'm glorified, He's the one who'll teach you about all things. And He'll remind you about all that I've taught you.
\p
\v 27 “Now I'm going to leave a blessing with you, so that you may live with a feeling of calmness of heart. The feeling of calmness that I give isn't the same as the feeling of calmness that's given by people of the world. So don't become troubled at heart or feel afraid.
\v 28 I've told you that I'm going away, but I will return to you. If you really love Me, you should rejoice that I'm leaving you and going to My Father, because He's more powerful than I am.
\v 29 Now I've told you about that, so that when that happens, you'll believe.
\p
\v 30 “I'm not going to say much more to you, because the ruler of this world is coming. But he doesn't have any power over Me at all.
\v 31 But what I'm doing now is in agreement with My Father's command to Me, so that people of the world know that I love the Father.
\p Then Jesus said to us again, “Now come! We're leaving this house.”
