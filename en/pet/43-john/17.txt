\s Jesus' prayer for His followers
\p
\v 1 After Jesus said all of that to us disciples of His, He looked to the sky and prayed, “Father, now the time has come. Glorify Me through what will happen to Me, Your Son. In this way I will also glorify You.
\v 2 For You've given Me authority over all mankind, so that I can give eternal life to each person You've given Me.”
\mi
\v 3 Because I remember that prayer of Jesus', I John also pray to God, “Father, this is definitely true! This is the way to receive eternal life: Which is that they should know You as the one and only true God, and also know Christ Jesus, whom You've sent to this world.\f + \fr 17:3 \fr Verse 3 \ft Many interpreters say that verse 3 is the thoughts of the writer, and not the words of Jesus. John put his own comments several times in this Gospel, including 2:11, 3:16-21, 19:35, 20:30-31, and 21:23-25.\f*
\m
\v 4 And Jesus continued praying, “Father, I've glorified You in this world through all the work You've given Me to do. Now that work is finished.
\p
\v 5 So now, Father, may You take Me back into the glory which We've shared together since before this world was created.
\p
\v 6 “Father, I've introduced You\f + \fr 17:6 \fr introduced You \ft Literally, “I've revealed Your name.” Here agan, 'name', shows the whole identity of God. In this chapter, the same way this was translated is the same as in verses 11-12 and 26.\f* to these men. They used to be on the side of worldly people too, but You gave them to Me. Of course they're Your own, but You, Father, have surrendered them to Me. And now they've obeyed Your teaching which I've given them.
\v 7 So now they know that all that I've done and taught comes from You, Father.
\v 8 For I've told the teachings that You've given to Me, and they've accepted all of them. Now they know that I really came from You, Father, and they believe that You're the one who sent Me.
\v 9 So I'm praying now especially for them. My prayer isn't for the people in this world who refuse to follow Your teachings. But I'm praying is for those that You've given to Me, Father, because they're Your own.
\v 10 Everything that I possess is Your's, and everything that You possess, Father, is Mine too. So these followers are our joint possessions. Through them I'm being glorified.
\p
\v 11 But now I won't live any longer with them in this world, because I'm going back to You soon. Holy Father, protect them with Your power— that is with the power that You, Father, have given to Me. In that way they'll become one, just like You and I are one.
\v 12 As long as I've been with them, I've guarded and protected them with all the power that You've given to Me, Father, so that none of them was destroyed. Only one of them who'll be destroyed— that is the one who was already destined to be destroyed. In that way, what was written in Your Word is fulfilled.
\p
\v 13 “Now I will return to You soon. For that reason, I'm praying about all of these things while I'm still in this world, so that these followers of Mine can know this prayer of mine so that they'll be full of joy. May the joy of each of them be like My joy when they face difficulties.
\v 14 They have received Your teaching which I gave them. That's why the people of this world hate them. For they, like Me, aren't on the side of worldly people.
\p
\v 15 I'm not asking You to take them from this world, but that You protect them from the attacks of the evil one— that is the devil.
\v 16 For they aren't possessed by this world, just like I'm not possessed by this world.
\v 17 Make them Your special possessions\f + \fr 17:17 \fk special possessions of Your's \ft Translates the words “make holy.” In this context, the meaning of “make holy” is that they'll live as special possessions of God, prepared for, and given power to serve Him. And their lives will certainly characterize holiness too.\f* through true teaching. All Your Word is true teaching.
\v 18 Just like You've sent Me to this world, Father, so I will send them into the whole world too.
\v 19 Now as Your possession, I also surrender Myself to You, Father. And I do this for them, so that they may also become Your special possessions through Your true teachings.
\p
\v 20 “I'm praying not only for them, but I'm also praying for the people who will later believe in Me because of their testimonies.
\v 21 And I'm asking that all of them become one, just like You are one with Me, Father, and I'm one with You. I also pray that they'll become one with Us, so that worldly people will believe that You, Father, are the One who sent Me to this world.
\v 22 I've given them the power and glory that You've given to Me. I've done that so that they'll remain one, just like We are always one—
\v 23 that is I'm one with them, and You're one with Me, Father, until they really become one. In that way, the people of this world will know that You, Father, are the one who has sent Me, and that You always love My followers too, just like You always love Me.
\p
\v 24 Father, regarding those You've given to Me, I always want them to be with Me too, in the place where I will be later on. I'm asking this so that they may see the glory which You, Father have given Me, before this world was created. And of course, that glory was given to Me because You love Me so much.
\v 25 Yes, Father, You always do what's right. Even though the people of this world don't know You, yet I know You. And these followers of Mine know that You, Father, are the one who has sent Me to this world.
\v 26 I've introduced You to them, Father, and I will keep telling them about You. In that way, they'll love Me from their hearts too— like you love Me. And I will remain one with them.”
