\c 21
\s Jesus shows Himself to seven of His disciples
\p
\v 1 After that, Jesus showed Himself again to us disciples of His, on the shore of Lake Galilee.\f + \fr 21:1\fk Lake Galilee \ft Literally, “Lake of Tiberias.”\f* This is what happened:
\p
\v 2 We who were there were Peter— who was also called Simon, Thomas— the Twin, Nathanael— from the village of Cana in the region of Galilee, me John and my older brother,\f + \fr 21:2 \fk my older brother \ft John literally wrote “the sons of Zebedee.” See the note in John 1:35.\f* and two other disciples of Jesus too.
\v 3 Then Peter said to us, “I want to go fishing.”
\p And the rest of us said, “We'll go along too— ok!” Then the seven of us got into a boat. It was late afternoon. But all that night we didn't catch a single fish.
\p
\v 4 Very early in the morning, Jesus stood on the lake shore. But we didn't know that He was Jesus.
\v 5 Then He said to us with a loud voice, “Hey, friends, did you catch any fish?”
\p And we answered, “Not yet.”
\p
\v 6 And He said, “Throw your net out on the right side of the boat, and you'll get fish.” Then we threw it out. When we tried to haul in the net, we weren't able to because too many fish were caught.
\p
\v 7 Then I— the disciple who was truly loved by Jesus, said to Peter, “Hey, that's the Lord!” When Peter heard that, he immediately tied his outer robe at his waist and jumped into the water, swimming to shore. Before that, he had worked without the long robe.
\v 8 Then the rest of us came with the boat, and helped tow the net which was full of fish. At that time, we weren't far from shore, only about a hundred meters.\f + \fr 21:8 \fk a hundred meters \ft Translates “two hundred cubits (hasta).”\f*
\v 9 When we were all on land, we saw that there were already some fish and some pieces of bread roasting on coals of fire.
\v 10 Then Jesus said to us, “Please bring some of the fish that you just caught.”
\p
\v 11 Then Peter got into the boat and pulled the net to shore. The net was full of big fish, totaling 153. Even though there were so many, yet the net wasn't torn.
\v 12 Then Jesus said to us, “Let's have breakfast.” None of us who were there was bold enough to ask Him, “What's your name, Sir?”, for we already knew that He was the Lord.
\v 13 Then Jesus shared the bread and fish with us.
\p
\v 14 That was the third time Jesus showed Himself to us after He had come back to life from death.
\s Jesus speaks with Peter
\p
\v 15 After we'd eaten, Jesus asked Simon— who was also called Peter, “Simon— son of John, do you love Me more than all of these close friends of yours love Me?”
\p Then Peter answered, “That's right, Lord, You know that I love You.”\f + \fr 21:15 \fk love \ft Two Greek verbs meaning 'love' were used by Jesus and Peter in verses 15-17. In the ancient Greek language there's a difference in the meaning of the two verbs, but in Jesus' day the two verbs came to mean the same thing— which is just 'love'. Because of that, almost all translations don't differentiate the meaning between those two words anymore. At the time this happened, it is quite possible that Jesus and Peter used the Aramaic language— everyday Hebrew. But one of the traits of John in his writing is that he always avoids repeating the same word. So in a story, he often used two words that had the same, or almost the same meaning. One other example is that he used two different words for ‘sheep’ in these verses.\f*
\p Then Jesus said to him, “Please feed My lambs.”
\p
\v 16 Not long after that, Jesus said to Peter again, “Simon, son of John, do you love Me?”
\p Peter answered, “That's right, Lord, You know that I love You.”
\p Then Jesus said to him again, “Please guard My sheep.”
\p
\v 17 And for the third time, Jesus said, “Simon, son of John, do you love Me?”
\p Peter's heart became sad because Jesus had asked him that three times. So he answered, “Lord, You know everything. You know that I love You.”
\p Then Jesus told him, “Please feed My sheep.
\v 18 What I'm telling you is very true: Now\f + \fr 21:18 \fk Now \ft Literally, “When you were still young.”\f* you always get ready by yourself\f + \fr 21:18 \fk get ready by yourself \ft Literally, “tie your belt.”\f* and go wherever you want to. But when you're old, you'll give your hands to other people, and they'll tie your hands, and take you to a place that you don't like.”
\v 19 In saying that, He showed the way Peter would later die to glorify God. Then Jesus said to him again, “Keep following Me!” Then they began to walk along the lake shore.
\s Jesus speaks about John himself
\p
\v 20 Then Peter turned around and saw that I was also following them from behind. I'm the one who previously sat close to Jesus when we ate together on the last night, and who asked, “Lord, who's the one who will sell You?”
\v 21 So Peter asked Jesus about me, “If that's so, Lord, what will happen to him?”
\p
\v 22 But Jesus answered, “You don't need to know about him. If I want him to stay alive until I return, that isn't your business. Just keep following Me!”
\p
\v 23 Because of those words of Jesus, the news spread among the brothers and sisters in the faith that I wouldn't die before Jesus returned. But He didn't say that. He only said, “If I want him to stay alive until I return, that isn't your business.”
\p
\v 24 I'm that disciple, and I'm writing this book as a testimony about all that happened. And I and the brothers and sisters in the faith know that my testimony is true.
\p
\v 25 There were still many other things Jesus did. But I think that if all of those things were written down, the whole world wouldn't have enough space to store the books that were written about all of those things.
