\c 8
\p [
\v 1 But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.
\v 2 The following day, very early in the morning, He returned to one of the courtyards of God's Temple, and many people came to Him. So He sat down and taught them.
\p
\v 3 Then the experts of the Law and several members of the Pharisees group came bringing a woman to Jesus. The woman was caught in the act of committing adultery. They forced her to stand in front of the crowd.
\v 4 Then they said to Jesus, “Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of committing adultery.
\v 5 Now, according to the Law, this person must be stoned to death. But what's your opinion?”
\p
\v 6 They questioned Jesus like that because they had made an agreement that if Jesus' didn't answer in agreement with the Law, they planned to accuse Him. But Jesus just bent down and wrote with His finger in the dirt.
\v 7 While the Jewish leaders still continued to press Him for an answer, He raised His head and said to them, “Whoever of you feels that he hasn't sinned, let him be the first to throw a stone at this woman.”
\v 8 Then He bent over again and wrote in the dirt.
\p
\v 9 When they heard Jesus' answer, they left one by one— beginning with the oldest, until finally only Jesus was left there with the woman. And the woman was still standing in that place.
\v 10 Then Jesus raised His head and said to her, “Where are those men? Isn't there anyone who wants to punish you?”
\p
\v 11 Then the woman answered, “There's no one, Sir.”
\p And Jesus said to her, “I won't punish you either. Go, and from now on don't commit sin anymore.”]
\p
\s Jesus is the world's light
\p
\v 12 After that, Jesus returned to talking with the crowd. He said, “I am the light of the world. Whoever follows Me won't live in darkness. For My light will shine on him and lead him to eternal life.”
\p
\v 13 Then the Pharisees said to Him, “But you're the only one who testifies about yourself, and there's no one else who testifies to support your testimony. So we can't believe what you've testified.”
\p
\v 14 Then He said to them, “Even though there isn't anyone who testifies to support My testimony, My testimony is still true. For I know where I came from and where I will go. But you don't know anything about Me.
\v 15 You accuse Me according to the customs of worldly people, but I didn't come to this world to punish mankind.
\v 16 If I judge people, I will judge them with justice, because I don't judge alone, but with My Father who sent me.
\v 17 In the Book of the Law, Moses ordered that when you judge someone, there must be a minimum of two eyewitnesses who say the same thing before acquitting or condemning a person.
\v 18 There are two who testify about Me: I testify about Myself, and the Father who sent Me also testifies about Me.”
\p
\v 19 Then they asked Him, “Where's your father?”
\p And Jesus answered, “You don't know Me or My Father either. If you really knew Me, you would certainly have known My Father too.”
\v 20 Jesus said all of that while He taught in the courtyard of God's Temple where there were several boxes to put offering money. Although He taught publicly in that place, no one tried to arrest Him, because the time hadn't come yet for Him to be arrested.
\s The Jewish leaders don't understand Jesus' teaching
\p
\v 21 Jesus spoke to the crowd again, “I'm going to leave you. Then you'll search for Me, and you'll die without forgiveness for your sins. You can't come to the place where I'm going.”
\p
\v 22 Then the Jewish leaders asked each other, “Does he want to kill himself? Maybe that's the reason he says, ‘You can't come to the place where I'm going.’”
\p
\v 23 But Jesus said to them, “You come from here below, whereas I come from there, above. You come from this world, but I'm not from this world.
\v 24 That's why I said to you that you'll die without forgiveness for your sins. Yes, that's what will happen to you if you don't believe that I'm He whom you're waiting for.”\f + \fr 8:24 \fk I'm He … \ft Literally, I am . Those words in the Greek language are just like one of the names for God in the Hebrew/Aramaic language— which is ‘Yahweh’. (Gen. 3:14; Is. 41:4, 43:10.) It's very likely that Jesus purposely used that expression with two meanings— that is “I am God,” and “I am the Christ— that is ‘Messiah’ who was promised.” That same thing happens six times in this book— that is in 8:24, 28, 58; 13:19; 18:5, 8.\f*
\p
\v 25 So they asked again, “What! That's impossible! Who do you think you are— to talk like that?!”
\p Then Jesus answered, “From the first time I taught you, I explained about Myself!
\v 26 Actually, there are still many things that I could tell in order to point out your sins. But I only speak according to what I hear from the Father who sent Me. He speaks only what is true, and that's what I tell you in this world.”
\p
\v 27 But they didn't understand that Jesus was speaking about His Father who was in heaven— not the one on earth.
\v 28 For that reason, He said to them, “When you raise Me up and hang Me— the Son of Man, at that moment you will know: I really am the one you're waiting for. And you'll realize that there's nothing that I do or teach from My own thoughts, but all of it agrees with what has been taught by My Father.
\v 29 The Father who sent Me is always with Me. He never leaves Me, because I always do whatever pleases Him.”
\v 30 When they heard Jesus say that, many people believed in Him.
\s How to be free from sin
\p
\v 31 Then Jesus said to the Jews who had believed in Him, “If you continue to follow My teaching, you really are My followers.
\v 32 You'll accept true teaching, and that true teaching is what will set you free.”
\p
\v 33 Then there were those who said to Him, “We're the descendants of Abraham! We've never become slaves of another nation. How can you say that we'll be set free?”
\p
\v 34 Then Jesus answered, “What I'm saying is really true. Everyone who commits sin has become a slave of the sin that he commits.
\v 35-37 Think about this example: A slave who's been bought isn't included as a member of his master's family. His status is not the same as a son— who's a member of that family forever. You think, 'We're descendants of Abraham, which means we're included in the family of God.' But you're actually slaves of sin. For that reason, if the Son of the Master of the House sets you free, then you're really free from slavery. Of course I know that you're descendants of Abraham. But even so, you try to kill Me because you don't want to accept My teaching.
\v 38 What I teach are the things that My Father has shown Me. But you do just what you learned from your father.”
\p
\v 39 Then they answered, “We're the children of Abraham.”
\p Then Jesus answered, “If you really were Abraham's descendants, you would certainly follow Abraham's example.
\v 40 I tell you the true teachings that I hear from God, yet you try to kill Me! Abraham never did that!
\v 41 So it's clear that you're not Abraham's descendants, because you're following a different father's example.”
\p Then the Jews answered, “We're not illegitimate children! Actually, the one and only God is the Father of all of us.”
\p
\v 42 Then Jesus said to them again, “If God really is your Father, you would definitely love Me, because I came from Him. I didn't come because of My own will, but He's the one who sent Me into this world.
\v 43 And this is why you can't understand My words: Because you refuse to accept My teaching.
\v 44 Your father is the devil! That's why you're happy to do his will. From the beginning, the devil was a murderer, and he always opposes true teaching, because true teaching can't abide in him. He likes to deceive, because that's his true nature. He's a liar and the father of all liars.
\p
\v 45 “Whereas My teaching is true. So that's why you can't possibly believe in Me!
\v 46 You've never proven that I've sinned. So if I teach what's true, why don't you believe in Me?
\v 47 Everyone who comes from the God will definitely listen to teachings from God. Obviously you don't want to hear His teaching. For that reason it proves that you don't come from God.”
\s Jesus talks about Himself and Abraham
\p
\v 48 Then those Jewish leaders immediately insulted Him, “You're a Samaritan who is already crazy and possessed by a demon!”
\p
\v 49 And Jesus answered, “I'm not possessed. I work to glorify My Father, but you insult Me.
\v 50 I don't seek praise for Myself. But there's One who wants Me to be honored. He's also the One who's defending Me.
\v 51 What I'm saying is really true: Everyone who keeps following My teaching won't die forever.”
\v 52 Then the Jews said to Him again, “Now it's clear that you're crazy and possessed by a demon! Abraham has died, and the prophets have also died. But you say, ‘Everyone who follows my teaching won't die forever.’
\v 53 So you think you're greater than Abraham— do you?! He's dead, and all of the prophets have also died. You think you're greater than all of them— huh?!”
\p
\v 54 Then Jesus answered, “If I work to seek honor for Myself, you don't need to believe in Me. But the One who honors Me is My Father— that is He whom you call your God.
\p
\v 55 But you don't know Him yet. I'm the One who knows Him. If I say that I don't know Him, then I've become a liar— just like you. But I do know Him, and I always obey His commands.
\v 56 Your ancestor Abraham was very happy when he heard the plan about My ministry in this world. When he witnessed the beginning of it, he was very joyful.”
\p
\v 57 Then they said to Him, “What?! You aren't fifty years old yet, and you say that you've seen Abraham!”
\p
\v 58 Then Jesus answered, “What I'm saying is really true: Before Abraham was born, I already was.”\f + \fr 8:58 \fk I already was \ft In the Greek language this expression is the name of God, ‘Yahweh’. See note in 8:24.\f*
\v 59 When they heard Jesus say that, they took up stones to throw at Him to kill Him. But suddenly Jesus made them unable to see Him, then he left God's House.
