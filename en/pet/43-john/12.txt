\c 12
\s Mary rubs oil on Jesus' feet at Bethany
\r (Matt. 26:6-13; Mark 14:3-9)
\p
\v 1 Six days before the celebration of Passover, Jesus and we disciples of His, went back to Bethany. Bethany is the village of Lazarus, whom Jesus had brought back to life after death.
\v 2 The people of that village held an evening dinner to honor Jesus. Martha also joined in arranging the food, while Lazarus was one of the people who sat and ate with Jesus.
\v 3 Then Mary brought a half liter of pure fragrant oil,\f + \fr 12:3 \fk fragrant oil \ft The word used in the Greek language means that this was oil of nard. The oil is made from the roots of a plant called “nard”— which grows in the land of India.\f* which was very expensive, and she rubbed oil on Jesus' feet , then dried them with her hair. The fragrance of that oil filled the whole house.
\p
\v 4 But Judas— one of Jesus' disciples who came from the village of Cariot, and after this would sell Jesus, protested by saying,
\v 5 “It would have been better if Mary turned that oil over for us to sell. Because if it had been sold, it would produce a lot of money,\f + \fr 12:5 \fk a lot of money \ft Literally, “300 denarii”. A denarius was a Roman coin made of real silver. At that time, one denarius was the wages of a worker for one day. So 300 denarii was about the same as the wages of a worker for one year.\f* and we could have used that money to help poor people.”
\v 6 But Judas didn't say that because he really wanted to help poor people, but because he was a thief. He was the treasurer who received all of the contributions given to Jesus and us, which were kept in a bag. But he often stole money from the bag.
\p
\v 7 Then Jesus said, “You don't need to rebuke this woman! Without knowing it, she has prepared My body for the time when I will be buried.
\v 8 There will always be poor people among you, and you have many opportunities to help them. But I won't always be with you.”
\s The chief priests make plans for Lazarus
\p
\v 9 That day, many Jews heard that Jesus was in the village of Bethany. So they went there to see Him and Lazarus, who had been brought back to life after dying.
\v 10 For that reason, the chief priests made plans to kill Lazarus also.
\v 11 For as soon as they heard the story about Lazarus, many Jews became believers in Jesus, then they began to leave the side of the chief priests.
\s The crowd welcomes Jesus as king
\r (Matt. 21:1-11; Mark 11:1-11; Luke 19:28-40)
\p
\v 12 The next day, the news spread that Jesus was heading for Jerusalem. So the crowd who had gathered there to take part in the Passover celebration
\v 13 took palm branches and went outside the city to welcome Jesus. They shouted,
\q “Hosanna! Praise God!\f + \fr 12:13 \fk Praise God! \ft They literally shouted “Hosanna.” That word is also translated here as “Praise God!” In the Hebrew language, before the time of Jesus, the word Hosanna meant, “Save us now,” or “I pray for help.” But at the time of Jesus, the meaning of Hosanna had become 'Praise God'.\f*
\q May God bless this new king\f + \fr 12:13 \fk king \ft A small letter is used here, to replace the name of Jesus, because those who are speaking aren't people who believe that He's God's Son.\f*
\q of Israel!”
\q2 This king is the one coming to represent the Lord!”\x + Ps. 118:25-26\x*
\p
\v 14 At that time, Jesus got a young donkey, then He got on the donkey. This happened in agreement with what had been written in the Word of the Lord,
\v 15 “Residents of Jerusalem,\f + \fr 12:15 \fk residents of Jerusalem \ft Literally, “sons of Zion.” Zion was the name of a hill where the city of Jerusalem was located.\f* don't be afraid!
\q Look! Your king is coming,
\q riding on a young donkey.”\x + Zach. 9:9\x*
\p
\v 16 When we disciples of His followed the crowd, we didn't understand that this was written about the Christ. But after Jesus was glorified through His death and His ascension to heaven, then we understand that we had done this according to the words of the prophet.
\p
\v 17-18 This is the reason many people went out to welcome Jesus on that day: Because when Jesus made Lazarus alive again by calling him out of his tomb, many people saw that event. Then they kept telling about that miracle to other people.
\v 19 When the Pharisees saw that, they said to one another, “Look! None of what we've done has accomplished anything at all. Everyone's following that man!”
\s Jesus speaks about His death
\p
\v 20 Among the people who came to worship at Jerusalem for Passover Day, there were also some people who weren't Jewish.\f + \fr 12:20 \fk weren't Jewish \ft Translates “Greek people.” At the time of Jesus, Greek was the common language. And all other people groups were called ‘Greek people’— including people groups that weren't from the land of Greece.\f*
\v 21 They came to Philip, and said to him, “Sir, we want to meet Jesus.” (Philip came from the town of Bethsaida in Galilee.)
\v 22 Then he went and told their request to Andrew. Then Andrew and Philip told Jesus.
\p
\v 23 Then Jesus said to those who weren't Jewish, “The time has come for Me— Son of Man, to be glorified by way of death.
\v 24 What I'm saying is really true: What will soon happen to Me can be illustrated by a grain of wheat. To produce many grains of wheat, that grain must be planted and die, only then can it grow again and produce many grains of wheat. If not, that grain will still be just one grain.
\v 25 In the same way, the man who wants to keep his own life in this world will lose his life. But the person who's ready to surrender his life will possess eternal life.
\p
\v 26 Everyone who wants to serve Me has to follow wherever I go, so that he remains with Me. My Father will respect who serves Me.”
\p
\v 27 “Now My heart is really sad. What should I say in My prayers? Certainly it's appropriate for Me to pray like this, ‘Father, save Me now from this suffering!’ But I can't ask for that, because it's precisely to experience this suffering that I came into this world.
\v 28 So I just pray, ‘Father, let Your name be glorified through what happens to Me!’”
\p Then all of us who were there heard a voice from heaven which said, “I've glorified My name through You, and I will do it again!”
\p
\v 29 One of us who stood there said, “That's the sound of thunder.”
\p But there was also one who said, “That's not so. That was the voice of an angel who spoke to Him.”
\p
\v 30 Then Jesus said to all of us, “That voice wasn't for Me to hear, but so that you could hear.
\v 31 Now the time has come for the people of this world to be judged. And now also the ruler of this world— who is the devil, will be thrown down and his power will be destroyed.
\v 32 Then the Son of Man\f + \fr 12:32 \fk Son of Man \ft Literally, “I.” Because of the question of the listener in verse 34, Jesus definitely used the term 'Son of Man' in this statement. See the note in John 1:51.\f* will be lifted up and hung above the earth. When that happens, I will open up a way so that all mankind can come to Me.”
\v 33 Jesus said that to tell how He would die.
\p
\v 34 Then within the crowd there was one who said to Him, “We've read in the Lord's Word\f + \fr 12:34 \fk Lord's Word\ft Literally, the “Law.” At that time, the Jewish people often called the whole Old Testament— not just the five books of the Law of Moses, “the Law,”.\f* that the Christ will live forever. So why do you say that the 'Son of Man' must be lifted up and hung?' Who do you mean by saying ‘the Son of Man’?”
\p
\v 35 Then Jesus said to them, “There's just a short time left for the light to still be with you in this world. So you should use the time while the light is still with you, so that when the darkness comes, that darkness won't overpower you. Because a person who walks in the dark doesn't know where he's going.
\v 36 So as long as I'm still with you, you should believe in Me as the light.\f + \fr 12:36 \fk believe in Me as the light \ft Literally, “believe in that light.”\f* In that way, the light will fill your lives,\f + \fr 12:36 \fk In that way … light \ft Literally, “So that you become children of light.”\f* and you won't go astray because of being overpowered by darkness.” After Jesus said that, He left with us disciples of His, and went to a place which was unknown to the crowd.
\s The opinion of the Jews concerning Jesus
\p
\v 37 Even though the Jews had witnessed so many miracles that Jesus had done, yet they still didn't believe in Him.
\v 38 In that way, the words of the prophet Isaiah were fulfilled, when he moaned a complaint to God,
\q “O God, almost nobody believes
\q2 when I tell news from You!
\q And when You stretch out Your powerful hand to do miracles, it's as if they can't see!”\x + Is. 53:1\x*
\m
\v 39 Because of that they can't believe: For Isaiah also said this,
\q1
\v 40 “God has made their eyes become blind,
\q2 so that they can't see,
\q1 and also closed their minds,
\q2 so that they can't understand.
\q1 In that way they can't return to Him.
\q1 But if they return, God has promised,
\q2 ‘I will still heal them.’”\x + Is. 6:10\x*
\m
\v 41 Isaiah said that, because long before Jesus came into this world, he had seen the glory of the Christ, and revealed that Jesus' life would be like that later on.
\p
\v 42 But at that time, there were actually quite a few people who believed in Jesus, including Jewish leaders. But because they were afraid of the Pharisee group, they didn't want to openly admit it, because they were afraid of being chased out of the Jewish synagogues, and forbidden to enter them.
\v 43 They liked pleasing people more than pleasing God.
\s People will be judged according to Jesus' teaching
\p
\v 44 But Jesus had cried out to the crowd, of course, “Everyone who believes in Me doesn't just believe in Me, but also believes in Him who has sent Me into this world.
\v 45 Whoever sees Me has seen Him who sent Me.
\v 46 I've come into this world as light, so that everyone who believes in Me won't live in darkness anymore.
\p
\v 47 “But it isn't Me who punishes the people who reject My teaching. For I didn't come into this world to punish people, but to free them from punishment as a result of their sins.
\v 48 But remember: Whoever rejects Me and My teaching will be punished by God on the last day— that is punishment that agrees with My teaching!
\v 49 For My teaching didn't come from Me alone, but from the Father who sent Me. He's the one who gave Me the task to tell this teaching.
\v 50 And I know that the teaching from the Father leads to eternal life. That's the reason I always teach according to what My Father told Me.”
