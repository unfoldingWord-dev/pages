\s The death of Lazarus
\p
\v 1-3 At that time, Jesus' friend named Lazarus was sick. He lived with his two sisters— namely Mary and Martha, in the village of Bethany, near Jerusalem. (This Mary was the one who would anoint Jesus' feet with fragrant oil and dry them with her hair.) So the two sisters of Lazarus sent someone to meet Jesus with this news, “Lord, Your close friend whom You love is sick.”
\p
\v 4 When Jesus heard that news, He said, “This sickness won't end in death, but it's for the glory of God. And through that, I, as God's Son, will also be glorified.”
\v 5 Even though Jesus loved Mary, Martha, and Lazarus,
\v 6 yet He remained there two more days with us disciples of His when He heard that news.
\v 7 After that, He said to us, “Come, let's return to Judea.”
\p
\v 8 Then we answered, “Teacher, not long ago the Jewish leaders almost threw stones at You, so do You really want to go back there?!”
\p
\v 9 Then He answered, “The sun shines every day for twelve hours. So if we walk in the daytime, we won't fall, because the light shines on us.
\v 10 But whoever walks at night often falls, because there's no light to guide him.”
\p
\v 11 Then He said again, “Our close friend Lazarus is now sleeping, but I want to go there to wake him up.”
\p
\v 12 Then we answered, “Lord, if he's sleeping that's good. It means he'll get well and wake up by himself.”
\v 13 (We thought that Jesus meant that Lazarus was sleeping normally. But Jesus actually used the word 'sleeping' figuratively— meaning 'dead'.)
\p
\v 14 Because of that, He said clearly to us, “Lazarus has died.
\v 15 And it's actually better that I wasn't there at that time to heal him. For this will make you believe in Me more. But come, let's go to him now.”
\p
\v 16 One of us was Thomas, who was usually called the Twin.\f + \fr 11:16\fr* \fk the Twin \ft Thomas' name came from the Hebrew language and had the meaning ‘twin’. Here John also gives his name in the Greek language— which is ‘Didimus’, which also means, ‘twin’.\f* At that moment he said, “Come let's follow Him, so that we're also killed with Him.”
\s Jesus is the only one who gives resurrection and life
\p
\v 17 When Jesus and we disciples of His arrived in Bethany, someone told Jesus that the body of Lazarus had already been in the tomb for four days.
\v 18 The village of Bethany was near Jerusalem. The distance between them was about three kilometers.\f + \fr 11:18\fr* \fk three kilometers \ft Literally, “15 stadia.”\f*
\v 19 At that time, many Jews had come to visit Martha and Mary, to comfort them because of their brother's death.
\p
\v 20 When Martha heard that Jesus was near, she immediately went to meet Jesus, while Mary stayed in the house.
\v 21 When they met, Martha said to Him, “Lord, if You'd been here before this happened, my brother definitely wouldn't have died.
\v 22 But I know that even now, God will give You whatever You ask of Him.”
\p
\v 23 Then Jesus answered, “Your brother will live again.”
\p
\v 24 And Martha said to Him, “I know that he'll rise and live again when everyone is resurrected when this world is over.”
\p
\v 25 But Jesus said to her, “I am the One who gives resurrection and life. Everyone who believes in Me will still live, even though he dies.
\v 26 And everyone who still lives and believes in Me will actually never die. Martha, do you believe that?”
\p
\v 27 Then she answered, “Yes, Lord. I believe that You're God's Son and the Christ— who was promised to come into this world.”
\s Jesus cries
\p
\v 28 After Martha said that, she returned to the house to call Mary. Because there were other people in the house, Martha whispered to her, “The Teacher is here, and He wants to meet with you.”
\p
\v 29 When Mary heard that, she immediately stood up and went to meet Jesus.
\v 30 At that time, Jesus hadn't entered the village yet, but He was still at the place where Martha met Him.
\v 31 It so happened that at the time, there were many Jews who had come to the house to comfort Mary. When they saw her stand up and go outside quickly, they thought she was going to Lazarus' tomb to cry. So they followed her.
\v 32 When Mary arrived at the place where Jesus was, and saw Him, she immediately knelt down and worshiped at His feet. Then she said, “Lord, if You'd been here before this happened, my brother would definitely not have died.”
\p
\v 33 When He saw Mary and the Jews who came with her crying, Jesus felt very sad and troubled in His heart.
\v 34 Then He asked Mary and Martha, “Where did you bury him?”
\p And they answered, “Come follow us, Lord, and see for Yourself!”
\p
\v 35 Then Jesus cried.
\p
\v 36 Because of that, the people who followed said, “Look! Jesus really loved Lazarus very much.”
\p
\v 37 But among them there were also those who said, “Jesus healed the eyes of a blind man— right? If so, why didn't He prevent Lazarus from dying?”
\s Jesus brought Lazarus back to life
\p
\v 38 With a very sad heart, Jesus came to the tomb. The tomb was a stone cave which was closed with a big rock.
\v 39 Then Jesus said to the people who were there, “Move that rock.”
\p But Martha said, “Lord, his body has been in the tomb for four days. It already smells rotten, for sure.”
\p
\v 40 Then Jesus said to her, “Remember what I said to you! If you believe in Me, God will show His power and His great glory to you!”
\p
\v 41 After they moved the rock, Jesus looked up to the sky and said, “Father, I thank You because You've heard My prayer.
\v 42 I know that You always hear Me. But I'm speaking like this because of the crowd gathered here listening to My prayer, and I want them to believe that You're the one who sent Me.”
\v 43 After saying that, He called with a loud voice, “Lazarus, come out!”
\v 44 Then Lazarus came out. His feet and hands were still tied with the cloth used to wrap the dead body, and his face was also still tied with a piece of cloth.
\p Then Jesus said to them, “Untie those cloths so that he's free to walk.”
\s The Jewish leaders plan to kill Jesus
\r (Matt. 26:1-5; Mark 14:1-2; Luke 22:1-2)
\p
\v 45 At that moment, many of those who happened to be there to comfort Mary believed in Jesus, because they witnessed the miracle themselves.
\v 46 But there were also those among them who went to the Pharisees and reported what Jesus had done.
\v 47 Because of that, the Pharisee group and the chief priests gathered with members of the Religious Court. They talked about the problem of Jesus like this, “What should we do? That man does many miracles.
\v 48 If we let him go on doing things like this, everyone will definitely believe in him. Then the king of Rome will order his soldiers to come and destroy God's Temple and all of the Jews.”
\p
\v 49 One of them was named Caiaphas. He was the high priest that year. He said to the them, “You don't know anything!
\v 50 When will you wake up?! Rather than all of the Jewish people being destroyed, it's better that one man die for our nation.”
\p
\v 51 But actually Caiaphas didn't say that from his own thoughts. That year he held the position of high priest. So without realizing it, his words were a prophecy from the Holy Spirit that Jesus would die for all of the Jews.
\v 52 And Jesus death wouldn't be just for the Jews alone. But the purpose of His sacrifice was to gather and unite all the people of the whole world who would become God's children.
\p
\v 53 So that day, the Jewish leaders made the decision to kill Jesus.
\v 54 For that reason, Jesus didn't travel openly in public among the Jews in the province of Judea anymore. He went with us disciples of His to a lonely region near the village of Ephraim, and stayed there.
\p
\v 55 Several days before the Jewish celebration day, which was called Passover, many people from the whole land of Israel went to Jerusalem. In agreement with the Law, they came several days beforehand to participate in the ceremony to cleanse themselves before the celebration.
\v 56-57 At that time, the chief priests and the Pharisee group, had put out a command that if anyone knew where Jesus was, they must report Him to them, so that they could arrest Him. So many people were searching for Him. When they stood in the courtyard of God's Temple, they often said to each other, “What do you think? Will Jesus come to this feast?”
