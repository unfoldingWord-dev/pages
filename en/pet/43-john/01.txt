\s Christ came to this world
\q1
\v 1 Much earlier, before this world was created,
\q1 He who's called the Word\f + \fr 1:1 \fk Word \ft Translates “logos” in the Greek language. ‘Logos’ may also be translated as ‘words’. John used that word as a title or another name for Christ Himself, because through the King of Salvation, God communicates about Himself with mankind.\f* was already with God.
\q2 And the Word is also God.\f + \fr 1:1 \fk is God \ft The Greek says “καὶ θεὸς ἦν ὁ λόγος.” There is no article ‘ὁ’ before ‘Theos’. This sentence can be translated, “and the Word was fully God.” ‘Fully God’ means that all of God's attributes are possessed by the Word, and vice versa. (See also John 10:30, 17:11 and 8:58 with its footnote.)\f*
\q1
\v 2 He lived with God from the beginning.
\q1
\v 3 God created everything through Him.
\q1 And there wasn't anything created by God
\q2 without Him who's named the Word.
\q1
\v 4 There's power in the Word Himself
\q2 which gives life to all creatures.
\q1 And that power of life is like light,
\q1 which can enlighten the hearts of mankind.\f + \fr 1:4 \fk enlighten….hearts of mankind \ft Literally “who is the light for mankind.” Here the translation uses ‘enlightens the heart’ so that it's clear that this isn't ordinary light, like that of the sun or a lamp. In verses 5-9 in the Greek language, it's clear that John uses ‘Light’ as another name for Christ.\f*
\q1
\v 5 So that Word is also called the Light of the World.
\q1 He shines into the darkness,
\q2 and the darkness isn't able to cover up His radiance.
\p
\v 6 At the time determined by God, He sent a man named John
\v 7 to give news about Him who's called the Word. And through John's news, everyone had the opportunity to believe in Him who enlightens the hearts of mankind.
\v 8 John himself wasn't the Light of the World, but he was only sent to give news about that Light.
\v 9 At that time, the true Light was coming to this world. He's the light which can truly enlighten every human heart.
\p
\v 10 Actually, He who's called the Word was already in this world from the beginning. This world was created by Him, but the people in this world didn't know Him.
\v 11 He came to the people group He had chosen,\f + \fr 1:11 \fk the people group He had chosen \ft Meaning the Jewish people, or the people of Israel. God chose the Jewish people so that through them the blessing of salvation would be given to all tribes and people groups. See Gen. 12:2-3; 18:18; 26:4; 28:14; John 4:22; Gal. 3:8. )\f* but most of them didn't want to believe in Him.
\v 12 But to all those who did receive Him, He gave the right to become God's children. What is meant by the words ‘those who did receive Him’ is that they believed in Him.\f + \fr 1:12 \fk believed in Him \ft Literally “believed in His name.” According to Jewish culture at the time of Jesus, ‘His name’ meant the whole identity of Jesus as the King of Salvation, and not just His name.\f*
\v 13 They become God's children, not because they were born through a normal birth, and it wasn't because of human desires or plans, but God Himself made them to be His children.
\p
\v 14 So the Word became human and lived with us. Some of us have witnessed His glory— which is the glory of the one and only Son of the Father. We know all of God's kindness to us through that Word, and He's very worthy to be believed.\f + \fr 1:14 \fk very worthy to be believed \ft Literally “full of truth.” This means that He's very worthy to be believed in His task to introduce God to mankind. (See John 1:16-18.) This is translated the same way for “He, God the Father, is true” in John 7:28, and “the true grapevine” in John 15:2.\f*
\v 15 When John witnessed about the Word, he said with a loud voice, “This is He whom I meant when I said, 'He who comes after me is far more important than I am, because long before I was born, He already existed.’”
\p
\v 16 It's really true, the Word is very worthy to be believed, and through Him we keep receiving proof of God's kindness to us.
\v 17 Of course God gave the Law to us through the prophet Moses, but we've received proof of His kindness and true teachings that are worthy for us to believe through Jesus, who is the Christ.\f + \fr 1:17 \fk Christ \ft is a word that comes from the Greek language, which means the 'Anointed One'. In the Hebrew language, the same term is called 'Messiah'. That term indicates a position, like 'district head' or 'governor'. In the time of the Old Testament, each king was anointed with olive oil by a prophet, as a sign of being chosen and confirmed by God. And every priest or prophet of that time was also anointed. It's appropriate to call Jesus the 'Anointed One', because He has the positions of proophet, High King, and High Priest (Heb. 4-10). Because of some prophecies in the books of the prophets and in the Psalms, at the time of Jesus, the Jewish people in general understood the meaning of “Christ” as the King of Salvation whom God promised, who would come from the descendants of King David, and who would free the people of Israel from those who opposed them, set up a government with the authority of God, and rule with justice. ( See Is. 9:5-6 [Indonesian verse numbering]; Gen. 3:15; Deut. 18:18-19; Mic. 5:2; Zec. 12:10-14; Mal. 3:1, 4:5-6; Ps. 2, 16, 22, 40, 110)\f*
\v 18 No one has ever seen God, except He who's the one and only Son of the Father. He's the closest one to the Father, and He Himself is God. He's the one who introduces God to us.
\s John the Baptist gives his testimony about Jesus
\r (Mat. 3:1-12; Mark 1:2-8; Luke 3:15-17)
\p
\v 19 While John was testifying about the Christ, the Jewish leaders from Jerusalem sent some priests and servants from the descendants of Levi to ask him, “In what position are you working?”
\p
\v 20 John openly admitted, “I'm not the Christ.”
\p
\v 21 Then they asked him, “If that's so, what is your position? Are you the replacement that was prophesied for the Prophet Elijah?\f + \fr 1:21 \fk replacement that was prophesied \ft In the Old Testament, to prophesy meant to tell news from God about something that would happen, or to give teaching from God. The prophecy that they were thinking of is found in Mal. 4:5-6.\f*
\p And John answered, “I'm not.”
\p They asked again, “Are you the prophet who was prophesied to replace Moses?”\f + \fr 1:21 \fk prophesied to replace Moses \ft Moses prophesied that in days to come God would appoint a prophet from among the people of Israel, just like God had appointed him, and all the people had to listen to that prophet. (Deut. 18:15-19)\f*
\p He answered, “I'm not.”
\p
\v 22 Then they asked him again, “So actually what is your duty? Please answer us, so that we can give an answer to those who ordered us to come to you. What do you say about yourself?”
\p
\v 23 John answered, “I'm the person who was mentioned by the Prophet Isaiah when he said,
\q1 ‘Later there'll be a person who shouts like this in the desert,
\q2 “Let's get ready to meet the Lord!’”\f + \fr 1:23 \fk Quoted \ft from Is. 40:3. The second line is literally, “Straighten the path for the Lord!”\f*
\p
\v 24 Some of those who were ordered to go and meet John were from the Jewish religious group called the Pharisees.
\v 25 Then they said to John, “You've said that you aren't the Christ, not the replacement for Elijah, and also not the prophet who was promised. So why do you baptize people?”
\p
\v 26 Then he answered, “I baptize with water, but there's a Person in your midst whom you don't know yet.
\v 27 He's the Person who comes after me. And I'm not worthy to serve Him, not even to untie His sandal strings.”
\p
\v 28 That all happened near the village of Bethany, in the place where John baptized. (That place is on the east side of the Jordan River.)
\s Jesus is the Lamb of God
\p
\v 29 The following day, John saw Jesus coming to him. Then John said to the people who were there, “Look! He's the Lamb of God! He's the one who will erase the sin of people in the world.
\v 30 He's the one I meant when I said, ‘He who comes after me is far more important than I am, because He existed long before I was born.’
\v 31 Before now, I didn't know Him either. But God sent me to baptize the people of Israel with water so that they could know Him— that He's the Christ.”\f + \fr 1:31 \fk Christ \ft See the footnote in John 1:17.\f*
\p
\v 32-34 And John said again, “I didn't know who the Christ was before now, but God, who sent me to baptize people with water told me, ‘You'll see My Spirit descend on a Person and stay on Him. He's the One who will baptize with My Spirit.’” Then John said again, “And I saw that happen! I saw the Holy Spirit come down from heaven like a dove and land on Him. That's why I testify to you that He truly is the Son of God.’ ”
\s Jesus chooses His first disciples
\p
\v 35 The following day, John stood again at that place with us, two of his disciples.\f + \fr 1:35 \fk us \ft Most expert interpreters say that it's quite possible that the writer of this Gospel was included in those two disciples of John the Baptist. This agrees with the nature of John's writings, because he almost always avoided mentioning his own name. (His name is only written clearly in the book of Revelation.) In this Gospel, this trait is seen also in 1:40; 13:23-25; 18:15; 19:26-27, 35; 20:2-9; and 21:2, 7. At the very end, in 21:20-25, John made it clear that the writer of this Gospel is “the disciple whom Jesus loved very much.” Why didn't John write his name directly? It's probably in order not to boast about himself as a person chosen to be a disciple of Jesus. In the TSI, the translation team felt it was important to make it clear that the writer of this book was an eye witness, so ‘us/we disciples of his’ and ‘I’, are used— according to what's natural in the Indonesian language.\f*
\v 36 When he saw Jesus passing by, he said, “Look, He's the Lamb of God!”
\p
\v 37 And when the two of us disciples of his heard him say that, we immediately followed Jesus from behind.
\v 38 When Jesus turned around and saw us following Him, He asked, “What're you looking for?”
\p We answered, “Rabbi, where are you staying?” (The name 'Rabbi' is from the Hebrew language, meaning 'Teacher'.)
\p
\v 39 Then He answered, “Just follow, and you'll see for yourselves.” So we followed Him and saw where He stayed. And from that day on, at about four o'clock in the afternoon, we stayed with Him.
\p
\v 40-42 Andrew was the one of us two who heard the words of John and then followed Jesus. He had a brother named Simon. Then Andrew quickly found his brother and said to him, “We've met the Messiah!” (Messiah means ‘Christ’.)\f + \fr 1:40 \fk Christ \ft See the note in John 1:17.\f* Then Andrew took Simon to Jesus. When Jesus saw Simon, He said to him, “Your name is Simon, son of John. But I'm giving you a new name— which is Cephas.” ('Cephas' in the Hebrew language has the same meaning as the word “petros”— which comes from the Greek language. The meaning of both words is 'big stone'.) For that reason, Simon was often called Peter.
\p
\v 43 The following day, Jesus decided to go to the region of Galilee. There He met Philip and said to him, “Come follow Me!”
\v 44 Philip came from the city of Bethsaida. Andrew and Peter were from that city too.
\v 45 After that, Philip found Nathanael and said to him, “We've met the one\f + \fr 1:45 \fk the one \ft In this verse, the word used in place of the name of Jesus uses a lower case letter, because Philip didn't yet believe that He was the Son of God.\f* who was prophesied by Moses in the Book of the Law, and who was also prophesied by the prophets. He's Jesus, the son of Joseph,\f + \fr 1:45 \fk son of Joseph \ft The miracles that happened when Jesus was born were not known even by the people of Nazareth— where He grew up. (Matt. 13:55; Luke 4:22) So the people of Israel considered Jesus to be the son of Joseph. (Luke 3:23) Mary and Joseph knew of course that Jesus was born through the power of the Holy Spirit when Mary wasn't yet united physically with Joseph.\f* from the village of Nazareth.”
\p
\v 46 Nathanael said to Philip, “Is it possible for a person who's good to come from that village?”
\p Then Philip answered, “Come and see for yourself!”
\p
\v 47 When Jesus saw Nathanael coming, He spoke to us about Nathanael, “Look, he's an Israelite who's faithful, who can't possibly deceive.”
\p
\v 48 Nathanael asked, “How do you know about me, Sir?”
\p Then Jesus answered him, “Before Philip told you about Me, I had seen you sitting under the fig tree.”
\p
\v 49 Then Nathanael said to Jesus, “Teacher, You're the Son of God, the King of the Israelites!”
\p
\v 50 And Jesus said to him again, “Do you believe just because I said to you that I had seen you sitting under the fig tree? Later you'll see things that are far more amazing than that.”
\v 51 Then Jesus spoke to him again and to all of us who were there too, “What I'm telling you is very true. You'll see heaven open up and 'the angels ascend and descend’\f + \fr 1:51 \fk ascend and descend \ft The words “angels ascend and descend” are quoted from Gen. 28:12— where Jacob saw stairs to heaven. Jesus meant here that He, like that stairway, is the Connection between God and man.\f* by way of Me— the Son of Man.”\f + \fr 1:51 \fk the Son of Man \ft When Jesus lived on earth, He often called Himself “the Son of Man.” But the meaning of this term isn't focused on the word 'son'. In the Hebrew language, 'son of man' meant 'normal human being'. Jesus called Himself this to remind His listeners about what the Prophet Daniel had witnessed in a vision of the King of Salvation. (Dan. 7:13-14) For Daniel saw Jesus in heaven in the form of 'a son of man'— meaning in the form of a 'normal human being', when God appointed Him King over everything. In this translation, “that is Me” is often added so that it's clear that Jesus is speaking about Himself.\f*
