\c 6
\s Jesus feeds more than five thousand people
\r (Matt. 14:13-21; Mark 6:30-44; Luke 9:10-17)
\p
\v 1 After that, Jesus left with us disciples of His for the other side of Lake Galilee— which is also called Lake Tiberias.
\v 2 Wherever He went, a crowd always followed Him, because they saw the miracles He did for sick people.
\v 3 Then Jesus climbed up a hill and sat there with us.
\v 4 At the time, the day of Passover— one of the Jewish celebration days, was near.
\p
\v 5 When Jesus looked around Him and saw many people coming to Him, He said to Philip, “Where can we buy bread so that all of them can eat?”
\v 6 He said that just to test Philip, because He already knew what He was going to do.
\p
\v 7 Then Philip answered, “What! If the twelve of us disciples worked for a whole month, our wages\f + \fr 6:7 \fk work … our wages \ft Literally, “Bread costing just 200 denari.” A denarius was a Roman coin made of real silver. At that time, one denarius was the same as the wages of a worker for one day.\f* would still not be enough to buy food for all of them, even if they each received just a small piece.”
\p
\v 8 Then one of us— that is Andrew, Peter's\f + \fr 6:8\fk Peter \ft Literally, “Simon Peter.”\f* brother, said,
\v 9 “There's a boy here who has five pieces of barley bread and two fish, but that's just useless for this many people.”
\p
\v 10 The total of them was about five thousand men. (That didn't yet include women and children.) The field of grass in that place was broad, so Jesus said to us, “Order them to sit down.” So we ordered them all to sit down.
\v 11 Then Jesus took the bread and fish and gave thanks to God for that bread and fish, then He asked for our help to distribute it to the crowd. Even though there were so many, if there were any who weren't full yet, they could ask for more.
\p
\v 12 After they were all full, Jesus said to us, “Gather up the leftover food so that none of it's thrown away.”
\v 13 When we gathered it up, there were twelve baskets full of leftover food.
\p
\v 14 But when the crowd saw the miracle, they said, “Wow, this man is definitely the prophet we're waiting for, whom Moses prophesied would come and help us!”\x + Num. 18:15-19; John 1:21\x*
\p
\v 15 Jesus knew that the crowd was making plans to force Him to become their king. Because of that, He went alone to a hilly place.
\s Jesus walks on water
\r (Matt. 14:22-27; Mark 6:45-52)
\p
\v 16 Then when it was nearly night, we disciples of His went down to the lake shore.
\v 17 At that time, it was beginning to get dark, and Jesus hadn't come with us. According to His orders,\f + \fr 6:17 \fk according to His orders \ft These words were taken from Mark 6:45 so that the actions of Jesus' disciples aren't considered unusual or impolite.\f* we got into a boat and crossed over in the direction of the city of Capernaum.
\v 18 Then the wind began to blow very hard, and the waves became huge too.
\v 19 At that time, we had rowed the boat about five or six kilometers. Then we saw Jesus walking on the water, approaching the boat, and we became afraid.
\v 20 But He said, “Don't be afraid! It's me.”
\v 21 When He said that, we gladly helped Him get into the boat. And at that very moment, the boat had arrived at our destination!
\s The crowd searches for Jesus
\p
\v 22 The following day, the crowd, which was still on the other side of the lake, realized that there was only one boat there yesterday, and Jesus hadn't crossed over with us.
\v 23 Then there were several other boats that came from the city of Tiberias. Those boats landed and were anchored not far from the place where Jesus gave bread to the crowd after He had given thanks to God.
\v 24 So when they saw that Jesus and we disciples of His weren't there anymore, they got into those boats and crossed over to Capernaum to look for Jesus.
\s Jesus is the bread that gives life
\p
\v 25 When they arrived on the other side of the lake, they searched until they found Jesus. When they found Him they asked, “Teacher, when did you come here?”
\p
\v 26 Then Jesus answered, “What I'm telling you is really true. You didn't look for Me, because you understood the miracles that I've done, but because you ate bread until you were full.
\v 27 This world's food will quickly get used up and become rotten. So don't work to get food like that. It's better for you to work to get food that never gets used up and never gets rotten— that is food which gives eternal life. And that food, only I the Son of Man, can give to you, because God the Father has given that right to Me.”
\p
\v 28 Then they asked Him, “So what should we do— so that God is happy with us so that we can receive the food that gives eternal life?”
\p
\v 29 Jesus answered, “This is what God wants you to do. Believe in Me, who has been sent by Him into this world.”
\p
\v 30 They asked Him again, “What miracle will you do? Give us proof— so that by seeing it, we will believe in you!”
\v 31 Our ancestors ate manna while Moses led them in the desert. That agrees with what's written in the Word of the Lord, ‘He gave them bread to eat from heaven.’”\x + Ps. 78:24\x*
\p
\v 32 Then Jesus said to them, “What I'm saying is really true: It wasn't Moses who gave bread from heaven to our ancestors, but it was My Father who gave that bread. And now He wants to give real heavenly bread to you.
\v 33 I'm that bread from heaven, because I came down from heaven to give true life to the people in this world.”
\p
\v 34 Then they said to Him, “Sir, give that bread to us always.”
\p
\v 35 Jesus answered, “I'm the bread that gives life. Everyone who comes to Me won't be hungry again, and everyone who believes in Me won't be thirsty again.
\v 36 But I repeat, You've seen Me, but you still don't believe in Me.
\v 37 Everyone whom My Father has entrusted to Me will come to Me, and I won't reject anyone who comes to Me.
\v 38 For I came down from heaven— not to do My own will, but to do the will of the Father who sent Me.
\v 39 This is the will of the Father: That I won't allow any of those surrendered to Me by the Father to be destroyed. And the Father desires that I make them all live again on the last day when everyone is judged.\f + \fr 6:39 \fk last day … \ft See John 6:40, 44, 54; 11:24 and 12:48.\f*
\v 40 Everyone who looks to His Son— that is to Me,\f + \fr 6:40 \fk looks to His Son \ft See John 3:14-15 and the note for verse 14.\f* and believes in Me, will receive eternal life. And I will bring each one of them back to life again on the last day. All of that is the will of My Father.”
\p
\v 41 Then the Jewish leaders began to complain about Jesus because He said, “I'm the bread which has come down from heaven.”
\v 42 They said, “This Jesus is just the son of Joseph. And we know his mother and father. How can he say, ‘I've come down from heaven’?”
\p
\v 43 Jesus said to them, “Don't complain.
\v 44 For no one can come to Me of his own will. If someone comes to Me, it's because the Father who sent Me has worked in his heart so that he comes to Me. And whoever comes to Me, I will bring to life again on the last day.
\v 45 This agrees with what was written by the prophets, ‘God will teach all of them.’\x + Is. 54:13\x* So everyone who hears and accepts the teaching from the Father will come to Me.
\v 46 There's no one who has ever seen the Father except Me, who came from Him. I'm the only one who has seen Him.
\p
\v 47 “I'm saying what's really true. Everyone who believes in Me already has eternal life.
\v 48 I'm the bread which gives life.
\v 49 Your forefathers really did eat manna from God in the desert. But after that, they still died just like all other human beings.
\v 50 But the true bread which comes down from heaven is here now. Everyone who eats this bread won't die.
\v 51 I'm the living bread which has come down from heaven. Everyone who eats this bread will live forever. For the bread that I give is My body, which is surrendered so that people in this world can receive true life.”
\p
\v 52 Then those leaders began to argue with each other. They said, “How can he give his body to us to eat?”
\p
\v 53 Then Jesus said to them, “What I— the Son of Man, am saying is really true: You have to eat My body and drink My blood. If not, you won't live forever.
\v 54 Whoever who eats My body and drinks My blood will live forever, and I will bring those people to life again on the last day.
\v 55 For My body is true food, and My blood is true drink.
\v 56 Everyone who eats My body and drinks My blood becomes one with Me, and I become one with him too.
\p
\v 57 My Father is the source of life. He's the one who sent Me, and I live because I'm one with the Father. In the same way, everyone who eats My body and drinks My blood will live because he has become one with Me.
\v 58 So I'm the bread from heaven. The bread that I give isn't like the bread which was eaten by your forefathers. Even though they ate that bread, they still died like all other human beings. But everyone who eats the bread that I give will live forever.”
\p
\v 59 Jesus said all of that in Capernaum, when He taught in a synagogue of the Jews.\f + \fr 6:59 \fk synagogue of the Jews \ft In New Testament times, synagogues were used for general meetings for the local Jewish people, and they were also used as places for the Jewish people to pray and study God's Word. Synagogues were different from God's Temple— which was in Jerusalem. The offering of burnt sacrifices was only done at God'sTemple, whereas synagogues were built in every city and village where the Jews lived.\f*
\s Many followers of Jesus leave Him
\p
\v 60 When the crowd, who usually followed Jesus, heard that teaching, they said, “This teaching is very difficult. No one can understand it.”
\p
\v 61 Jesus knew that those who usually followed Him were complaining because of that teaching of His, so He said to us twelve disciples of His, “Are you unhappy with My teaching too?
\v 62 If so, you definitely won't be happy if you see Me— the Son of Man, return to heaven!
\v 63 For what I just taught you comes from the Holy Spirit, so that teaching of mine has the power of the Spirit to give life. No human effort can give life. The one who gives life to mankind is the Holy Spirit.
\v 64 But I know that there are some of you who don't believe in Me.” (For Jesus knew from the beginning just who didn't believe in Him— in fact He knew the one who would betray Him in later days.)
\v 65 Then He said to us, “That's why I said to you, ‘No one can come to Me of his own will. For My Father has to work in his heart first, only then can he come to Me.’”
\p
\v 66 After that, many people who had followed Jesus didn't want to follow Him anymore, and they went and left Him.
\p
\v 67 Then Jesus asked us, “Do you want to leave Me too?”
\p
\v 68 Then Peter answered, “Lord, we can't leave You, because Your teachings have power so that we can receive eternal life.
\v 69 And we believe that You are the holy Messenger from God.”
\p
\v 70 Then Jesus answered us, “Even though I've chosen you twelve men myself to become My disciples, yet one of you is a servant of the devil.”
\v 71 The one Jesus meant was Judas, the son of Simon, from the village of Cariot. Judas was included as one of us twelve disciples, but he was the one who later betrayed Jesus.
