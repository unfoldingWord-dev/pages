\s The Shepherd and His sheep
\p
\v 1 Then Jesus said to all of those who were there, “What I'm saying is really true: Everyone who wants to enter the sheep pen must go through the door. If he enters at night by climbing the fence, he is definitely one who wants to steal and plunder the sheep.
\v 2 Whereas the shepherd of the sheep will certainly enter through the door.
\v 3 Then the guard of the sheep pen will open the door for him. And when the shepherd calls the name of each of his sheep, those sheep will know his voice and follow him when he leads them out.
\v 4 And when he takes the sheep out, he always walks in front. His sheep always follow him, because they know his voice.
\v 5 But those sheep won't follow another man— and they will even run from him because the sheep don't know his voice.”
\p
\v 6 After Jesus told that analogy, none us who heard it understood its meaning.
\s Jesus is the faithful shepherd
\p
\v 7 So Jesus said again, “What I'm telling you is really true: I am the door into the sheep pen.
\v 8 Everyone who came before Me and claimed to be the shepherd was a thief and a robber. But the sheep didn't follow anyone like that.
\v 9 Yes, I am the door. Everyone who enters through Me will be saved. And I will guard him so that he may go out and come into the pen safely and get food.
\v 10 But the thief just comes to steal, kill and destroy. But I've come to this world to give life— life that's full of blessings.
\p
\v 11 “I am the faithful shepherd. A faithful shepherd will surrender his life to save his sheep.
\v 12 But a hired worker won't work like the shepherd who owns the sheep. When the worker sees a wolf come, he'll run away and leave the sheep. Then the wolf will catch one of the sheep, and the others will run here and there.
\v 13 He runs because he's just a hired worker and he doesn't care for the sheep.
\p
\v 14-15 “I am the faithful shepherd. I will surrender My life to save My sheep. Just as My Father knows Me deeply, I also know My sheep. And just as I really know My Father, My sheep also know Me.
\v 16 I also have other sheep who haven't yet been joined with this flock. So I need to lead them so that they are united with this flock. They'll hear My voice too. And finally, all of My sheep will become one flock, with one shepherd— which is Me.
\v 17 So this is the reason My Father loves Me: Because I'm ready to surrender My life to save them. But after death, I will live again.
\v 18 My death is not the fault of anyone at all. Instead, I Myself am the one who surrenders My life. For I Myself have the right over My life— both to determine the time of My death and the time I will live again. All of this is according to My Father's command to Me.”
\p
\v 19 When the Jews heard Jesus teach like that, they began to argue with each other.
\v 20 Many of them said, “He's crazy because he's possessed by a demon. You don't need to listen to him!”
\p
\v 21 But others said, “What he was just saying isn't like the words of a man possessed by a demon! A man possessed by a demon couldn't possibly heal the eyes of a blind man.”
\s The argument between the Jewish leaders and Jesus
\p
\v 22 Not long after that, Jesus was in Jerusalem at the time of the celebration to remember the Dedication of God's Temple. It was winter at the time.
\v 23 And Jesus was walking in the Courtyard of Solomon in God's Temple.
\v 24 Then the Jewish leaders came and gathered around Jesus and said to Him, “We've been waiting for a long time for you to tell us plainly about who you really are! If you're definitely the Christ, say so!”
\p
\v 25 So He answered, “I've told you, but you don't believe. I've done many miracles in My Father's name. Those things show My position.
\v 26 But you don't believe because you're not My sheep.
\v 27 For My sheep always hear My voice. I know them, and they always follow Me.
\v 28 I give eternal life to them. So My sheep won't die forever, and there isn't anyone who can snatch them from My hand.
\v 29 The One who has given those sheep to Me is My Father. He's the one more powerful than all there is, and no one can snatch them from Our hands.\f + \fr 10:29 \fr Our hands \ft Jesus literally said, “no one can snatch them out of the Father's hands.” But because of what He said in verse 28b and 29a, He meant that the Father and He hold those sheep together. This agrees with John 17:10.\f*
\v 30 My Father and I are one.”
\p
\v 31 Then once more\x + John 8:59\x* the leaders picked up stones to throw at Jesus to kill Him.
\p
\v 32 But He said to them, “According to My Father's command, I've done many miracles\f + \fr 10:32 \fr miracles \ft In the Greek language, Jesus said, “good deeds,” but here and 37-38, he doesn't mean usual deeds.\f* among you. So is there a miracle that you didn't like, so that you want to kill me with stones?”
\p
\v 33 Then they answered, “There isn't! We don't want to kill you because of the miracles you do, but because you insult God. You're just a human being, but you make yourself to be the same as God.”
\p
\v 34 Then Jesus answered them, “You've received the Word of the Lord, and of course you've read in it that God says,
\q1 ‘You're all children of the Greatest God,
\q2 and you have characteristics like Him.’\f + \fr 10:34 \fr children of God \ft Jesus quoted from Ps. 82:6. According to what John wrote in the Greek language, Jesus only said the first part of that verse— which literally says, “I— that is God, say, ‘You're gods.’” (The word 'gods' is usually translated 'deities' in the Indonesian language.) The whole verse is literally, “I say, ‘You're deities, and you're all children of the Most High.’” This translation includes all of Ps. 82:6, because that makes the meaning clearer for today's readers.\f*
\m
\v 35 The Word of the Lord is definitely always true. So if God Himself called those people His children— that is the people who had received the Word of God,
\v 36 then you don't need to think that I insulted God because I said, 'I'm the Son of God'. He's the one who set Me apart and sent Me into this world.
\v 37 If I don't do miracles that glorify My Father, you don't need to follow My teaching.
\v 38 But if I actually do many miracles that glorify My Father, and you still don't want to believe in Me, it would be better for you to believe that those things I do come from the Father. In that way you'll know and understand that the Father is one with Me, and I'm one with Him.”
\p
\v 39 Then they tried to arrest Jesus again, but there was something that prevented them, so that He escaped from their hands.
\p
\v 40 Then He went to the other side of the Jordan river, the place where John had baptized people earlier, then He stayed there.
\v 41 Many people went to Him. They said, “John never did even one miracle, but everything he said about this man is true.”
\v 42 And many people there began to believe that Jesus was the Christ.
