\c 18
\s Jesus is arrested
\r (Matt. 26:47-56; Mark 14:43-50; Luke 22:47-53)
\p
\v 1 When Jesus finished praying, He and us disciples of His crossed the Kidron stream. There we all went into an olive garden.
\p
\v 2 Judas— who sold Jesus, also knew that place, because Jesus often met with us there.
\v 3 Then Judas came to the garden bringing a troop of Roman soldiers, and several of the guard soldiers from God's Temple. This group was sent by the chief priests and the Pharisees, They came bringing lanterns, torches, swords and other weapons of war.
\p
\v 4 Jesus already knew all that would happen to Him. So He immediately went out to meet them and asked, “Who're you looking for?”
\p
\v 5 Then they answered, “Jesus, that Nazarene.”
\p Then Jesus said, “I am He.”\f + \fr 18:6 \fk I am He … \ft Only some commentators say that Jesus intentionally used words that have a double meaning as explained in the footnote to John 8:24. According to the explanation in the Simple Indonesian Preface, because Jesus was speaking to people who opposed him, this may also be translated,using the formal form of ‘I/Saya’ in the Indonesian language. If it is translated like that or with informal ‘I/Aku’, what happened in verse 6 can be explained like this: God the Father— remembering Jesus' prayer (especially 17:1), desired to show honor to Jesus before He undertook His suffering. See John 8:54.\f* (Judas was also standing there with that group.)
\v 6 At the moment Jesus said, “I am He,” suddenly, without realizing it, the whole group stepped back and fell to the ground.
\p
\v 7 uJesus asked them once again, “Who're you looking for?”
\p And they answered, “Jesus, that Nazarene.”
\p
\v 8 Then He said, “I told you, ‘I am He.’ So if you're looking for Me, let My followers go.”
\v 9 By saying that, this prayer of Jesus was answered, “Of those whom You've given Me, Father, none of them will be destroyed.”
\p
\v 10 At the time, Peter— who was also called Simon, had brought a sword. He immediately took it out of its sheath and wanted to kill a slave of the high priest. But he only cut off the right ear of that slave. (The slave's name was Malchus.)
\v 11 Then Jesus said to Peter, “Put your sword back in its sheath. Don't try to prevent Me from going through suffering\f + \fr 18:11 \fr suffering \ft Literally, “the cup.” In the Jewish culture, the cup had become an analogy for experiencing suffering according to the plan of God.\f* that's according to what My Father has planned for Me.”
\s Jesus is brought before Annas, the former high priest
\r (Matt. 26:57-58; Mark 14:53-54; Luke 22:54)
\p
\v 12 Then the commander of the Roman troops, along with the whole group, arrested Jesus and tied Him up.
\v 13 They first took Jesus to Annas— who was the father-in-law of Caiaphas. Caiaphas held the office of high priest that year.
\v 14 (Caiaphas is the high priest who said this to the Jewish leaders, “Rather than all of the Jewish people being destroyed, it's better that one man die on behalf of our people.”)\x + John 11:49-52\x*
\s Peter says that he doesn't know Jesus
\r (Matt. 26:69-70; Mark 14:66-68; Luke 22:55-57)
\p
\v 15 When Jesus was taken to the house of Annas, Peter\f + \fr 18:15; 18:25 \fr Peter \ft Literally, “Simon Peter.”\f* and I, John,\f + \fr 18:15 \fr I, John \ft Literally, “another one of the disciples.” Many interpreters say that it's most likely that this disciple is John. See the footnote in John 1:35.\f* followed the crowd from behind. It so happened that I knew the former high priest, so I immediately went in when Jesus was brought into the yard of his house.”
\v 16 But Peter waited outside near the yard gate. Because I was known by the former high priest and his helpers, I went out again and spoke to the female helper who was guarding the gate. After being given permission, I brought Peter inside.
\v 17 And the helper had the opportunity to ask Peter, “You're also a disciple of that man— right?”
\p And he answered, “That's not so.”
\p
\v 18 It was cold that night. So the guards of God's Temple and all of the slaves of the high priest had made a fire of coals. And they stood warming themselves near the fire. Peter also approached them and stood there to warm himself.
\s Annas asks about Jesus' teaching
\r (Matt. 26:59-66; Mark 14:55-64; Luke 22:66-71)
\p
\v 19 At the same time, the former high priest asked Jesus about His disciples and about what He taught.
\v 20 Then Jesus answered him, “I\f + \fr 18:20 \fk I \ft Jesus is speaking to people opposing Him. The Greek language doesn't differentiate between first person formal or informal pronouns like Indonesian does. See the explanation about this in the Preface.\f* always spoke openly before the crowd. I always taught in the synagogues and in the courtyard of God's Temple where the Jews usually gather. I never spoke secretly.
\v 21 So you Sir don't need to ask me about that. Just ask those who heard my teaching. They certainly know what I said.”
\p
\v 22 The moment Jesus said that, one of the guards who stood there slapped His face and said, “Don't speak like that to the high priest.”
\p
\v 23 So Jesus answered him, “If I said something that goes against the rules, you should point out My offense before hitting Me. But if the words I just said were true, you actually can't hit Me!”
\p
\v 24 Then Annas sent Jesus, who was still tied up, to the high priest, who was Caiaphas.
\s Peter denies Jesus again
\r (Matt. 26:71-75; Mark 14:69-72; Luke 22:58-62)
\p
\v 25 While Peter was still standing warming himself near the fire, a person said to him, “Aren't you one of the disciples of that man?”
\p But he denied it and said, “That's not so.”
\p
\v 26 There was a slave of the high priest standing there too. That slave was from the family of the slave whose ear was cut off by Peter. So he said, “It looks like you're the one I saw earlier in the garden with Jesus— right?!”
\p
\v 27 But as Peter denied again, “It wasn't me,” a rooster immediately crowed.
\s Pilate tries Jesus
\r (Matt. 27:1-2; 11-31; Mark 15:1-20; Luke 23:1-25)
\p
\v 28 The next day, early in the morning, they took Jesus from the house of Caiaphas to the Roman governor's palace. But the Jewish leaders who took Him didn't enter the palace, because the Jews considered the houses of people who weren't Jews to be unclean.\f + \fr 18:28 \fr the Jews considered … unclean \ft According to tradition, Jewish people weren't allowed to enter non-Jewish people's houses. It wasn't written in the Law of Moses. The reason for that regulation was so that they wouldn't touch something that was considered to be unclean according to the Law of Moses. If a person touched something unclean, it meant he became unclean too, and would have to follow the cleansing procedures in the Law of Moses, in order to be pleasing again in God's eyes. (See Num. 9:7-11.)\f* They didn't want to make themselves unclean, because they had to be ready that day to take part in eating the Passover meal.
\v 29 Because of that, Pilate went outside to meet them, then he asked, “What is your accusation against this man?”
\p
\v 30 Then they answered, “If he wasn't a criminal, we wouldn't need to bring him to you, Sir!”
\p
\v 31 But Pilate said to them, “You can try him yourselves according to your laws.”
\p But the Jewish leaders said, “According to Roman law, we Jews aren't permitted to give the death penalty.”
\v 32 (What they said was actually in agreement with the plan of God, so that what Jesus said earlier about the way He would die would happen just like that.)
\p
\v 33 Then Pilate entered the governor's palace again and ordered his soldiers to bring Jesus inside. Then he asked Jesus, “Is what they say true, that you consider yourself to be the king of the Jews?”
\p
\v 34 And Jesus said to him, “Do you Sir want to know yourself, or do you ask in order to examine what other people said about me?”
\p
\v 35 Then Pilate answered, “You know I'm not a Jew! Your own people, along with the chief priests, are the ones who surrendered you to me. So what did you do wrong?”
\p
\v 36 Then Jesus said to him, “My government is not from this world. If My government was from this world, those who are on My side would certainly have fought so that I wouldn't have been surrendered to the Jewish leaders. But the place of My government isn't in this world, of course.”
\p
\v 37 Then Pilate said to Him, “So according to you, you're a king—huh?”
\p Jesus answered, “That's so. I'm a king. I was born for that purpose, and for that purpose I came into this world— in order to tell true teaching. Everyone who's happy to hear true teaching is certainly happy to hear My teaching too.”
\p
\v 38 Then Pilate said to Him, “True teaching? What's that?” And he immediately went outside again and met with the Jewish leaders, then he said to them, “I do not find anything at all wrong with this man.”
\v 39 But according to your custom, every governor will release one prisoner each year on Passover Day. Do you want me to release the Him who you call the 'king of the Jews’?”
\p
\v 40 But they shouted, “Not him! But release Barabbas!” Barabbas was a rebel. Unfinished
