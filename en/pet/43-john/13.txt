\c 13
\s Jesus washes the feet of His disciples
\p
\v 1 On the night before the Passover Celebration Day, Jesus knew that the time had come for Him to leave this world (die) and return to His Father. Jesus always loved everyone who had become His own in this world, and in that way He kept proving His love for us until the last day of His life.
\p
\v 2 At the time that Jesus and we disciples of His were eating supper together, the devil had already worked in the heart of Judas so that he planned to sell Jesus to His enemies. (This Judas was the son of Simon, from the village of Cariot.)
\v 3 Jesus knew that His Father had already surrendered all power into His hand. He also knew that He came from God, and at that moment it was almost time for Him to return to God.
\v 4 While we were eating, Jesus stood up and took off His robe. Then He took a towel and tied it around His waist.
\v 5 Then He put water into a basin and began to wash all of our feet, and dry them again with the towel which He had tied around His waist.
\p
\v 6 When He came to Peter— who was also called Simon, Peter said to Him, “Lord, You don't need to wash my feet.”
\p
\v 7 Then Jesus answered him, “You won't understand what I'm doing now. But later on you'll understand.”
\p
\v 8 Then Peter\f + \fr 13:8 \fr Peter \ft Literally, “Simon Peter.” Using both names like that means, “Peter— who was also called Simon'. The two names are also translated 'Peter' in verses 24 and 36, and several other verses in this Gospel.\f* said again, “I will never allow You to wash my feet!”
\p But Jesus said to him, “If I don't wash your feet, you're no longer My follower.”
\p
\v 9 Then Peter said to Him, “Lord, if that's so, don't just wash my feet, but wash my hands and my head too!”
\p
\v 10 Jesus said to him, “The body of a person who has bathed is already clean. After he walks around, he only needs to wash his feet. Most of you are clean in the eyes of God, but one of you isn't clean.”
\v 11 Jesus said that because He knew who had already planned to sell Him. That's why He said, “One of you is unclean.”
\p
\v 12 After Jesus washed all of our feet, He put on His robe again and returned to His seat. Then He said to us, “Do you understand what I did to you just now?
\v 13 You call Me ‘Teacher’ and ‘Lord.’ And those two titles are true, because that's what I really am.
\v 14 So even though I'm your Teacher and Lord, I've humbled Myself like a servant and washed your feet. That means you must also wash each other's feet.
\v 15 For I've given you this example, so that you do the same thing that I've done to you.
\v 16 What I'm saying is very true: A servant isn't greater than his master. In the same way, someone who represents another person isn't greater than the one who sent him.
\v 17 That's certainly clear. So you'll be truly blessed if you follow My example and serve each other.
\p
\v 18 “I don't say that about all of you, because I know those whom I've chosen. But what's written in the Word of the Lord must be fulfilled which says,
\q ‘My friend, who usually ate with Me,
\q2 is the one who became My enemy.’\f + \fr 13:18 \fr became My enemy \ft Literally, “lifted up his heal against Me.” This sentence is a quote from Ps. 41:10.\f*
\m
\v 19 I'm telling you this now, so that when he acts, you'll believe that I'm the one you're waiting for.
\p
\v 20 What I'm saying is really true: Whoever accepts a person whom I send, accepts Me. And whoever accepts Me, accepts the Father who sent Me.”
\s Jesus tells plainly about who will sell Him
\r (Matt. 26:20-25; Mark 14:17-21; Luke 22:21-23)
\p
\v 21 When Jesus said that, He became very sad, then He said openly, “What I'm telling you is really true: One of you will sell Me to My enemies.”
\p
\v 22 We felt confused and looked at each other, because we didn't know whom He meant.
\v 23 I— that is the disciple whom Jesus loved very much),\f + \fr 13:23 \fk the disciple whom Jesus loved very much \ft As usual, John didn't literally write ‘I’ about himself in this verse. But John's identity as that disciple was revealed by John in John 21:24-25. (See the note in John 1:35.)\f* was sitting near the right side\f + \fr 13:23 \fk sitting near … the right \ft Literally, John wrote “leaning on Jesus' chest.” At that time, the Jews didn't use chairs when they ate, and they used low tables. So when they ate, they leaned on their left elbow and ate with the right hand.\f* of Jesus.
\v 24 Then Peter gave me a sign with his hand, so that I would ask Jesus whom He meant.
\p
\v 25 Then I turned around so that I was even closer, and whispered to Him, “Lord, who is that man?”
\p
\v 26 Then He answered, “The one who receives the bread that I dip, he's the man.” After saying that, He took a piece of bread, then dipped it in the bowl and gave it to Judas— the son of Simon, from Cariot.
\v 27 When Judas ate the bread, the devil immediately entered his heart. Then Jesus said to him, “Do what you're planning to do quickly.”
\v 28 But none of us who were eating there understood what Jesus meant when He said that to Judas.
\v 29 Because Judas was the treasurer, some of us thought that Jesus meant for him to buy something that was needed for the following days of the celebration. There were also those who thought that Jesus wanted him to give something to the poor.
\p
\v 30 So as soon as he ate the bread, he immediately left. It was already night at the time.
\s Jesus speaks about His death and gives a new commandment
\p
\v 31 After Judas went out, Jesus said to us, “Now it's time for Me, the Son of Man, to be glorified. And God will be glorified through what happens to Me.
\v 32 Because I will glorify God, He'll also glorify Me. And He'll do it soon.”
\p
\v 33 Jesus said again, “My children, I will be with you for just a short time more, and after that you'll search for Me. So now I'm telling you the same thing I told the Jewish leaders: You can't come to the place where I'm going.
\p
\v 34 I'm giving a new command to you: Wwhich is that you must love each other. In the same way that I've loved you, you must also love each other.
\v 35 If you love each other, then everryone will know that you're My disciples.”
\s Jesus tells that Peter will deny Him
\r (Matt. 26:31-35; Mark 14:27-31; Luke 22:31-34)
\p
\v 36 Then Peter asked Jesus, “Lord, where're You going?”
\p And He answered, “You can't go with Me now to the place I'm going. But at a later time you'll follow Me to that place.”
\p
\v 37 Peter asked again, “Lord, why can't I follow You now? I'm ready to surrender my life to save You.”
\p
\v 38 Jesus answered, “You want to surrender your life to save Me— do you? You can't! What I'm telling you is really true: Before the rooster crows, you'll say that you don't know Me three times.”
