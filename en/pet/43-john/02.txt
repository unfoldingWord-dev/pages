\s The wedding feast at Cana
\p
\v 1 Two days later, there was a wedding feast in the village of Cana, in the region of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was present at the feast.
\v 2 Jesus and we disciples of His, were also invited to the feast.
\v 3 When the wine was gone, Jesus' mother said to Him, “They've run out of wine.”
\p
\v 4 Then Jesus answered, “Mother, you don't need to get involved in My affairs. The time to show My power hasn't come yet.”
\p
\v 5 Even though Jesus answered in like that, His mother said to the servants who were in that house, “Do whatever He says!”
\p
\v 6 There were six large water containers in that house, which were made of stone. Those containers were filled with water so that each guest could rinse his hands according to the Jewish custom.\f + \fr 2:6 \fk could wash…according to the Jewish custom \ft Literally, “for the cleansing of the Jews.” See Mark 7:2-4 and the footnote for verse 2. The water was used for the required cleansing of oneself according to their custom, and not actually for true cleaning— like when washing with soap. This custom wasn't written in the regulations of the Law.\f* Each water container held about 100 liters.\f + \fr 2:6 \fk about 100 liters \ft Literally, “two or three metretas.”\f*
\p
\v 7 Jesus told the servants, “Fill up all of those containers with water.” So they filled all the containers full of water.
\p
\v 8 Then He said to them, “Now take a little water from there and give it to the master of ceremony.”
\p So they did what Jesus told them to do.
\v 9 When the master of ceremony tried a little, the water had obviously already changed into wine! He didn't know where the wine was from, but the servants who brought the water knew about it. Then the master of ceremony called the bridegroom
\v 10 and said to him, “When people have a feast, they always serve the more delicious wine. And after all the guests have had enough, only then do they serve what's cheaper in order to save money. But it's just now that you're serving the best.”
\p
\v 11 That's how Jesus did the first miracle. It was done in the village of Cana in the region of Galilee. In that way, Jesus began to reveal His glory, and we disciples of His began to believe in Him.
\p
\v 12 After that Jesus went to Capernaum\f + \fr 2:12 \fk Capernaum \ft was a city in the region of Galilee on the west side of the shore of Lake Galilee— where Jesus often taught.\f* with His mother, His brothers, and also us disciples of His. We stayed there for several days.
\s Jesus drives out the people who made the courtyard of God's Temple into a market
\r (Matt. 21:12-13; Mark 11:15-17; Luke 19:45-46)
\p
\v 13 At the time, the celebration day of the Jewish religion which was called Passover was near, so Jesus went to Jerusalem.
\v 14 Jesus saw that there were many people in the courtyard of God's Temple who made that place into a market. The people were selling cows, sheep, and doves. There were money changers there too.
\v 15 For that reason, Jesus made a whip from several pieces of rope, then He chased them and all of their animals out of the courtyard of God's Temple. And He turned over the tables used by the money changers, so that the money scattered everywhere.
\v 16 He told the dove sellers, “Take all of these birds out. Don't turn My Father's Temple into a market!”
\p
\v 17 At that time, we disciples of His remembered that in the Word of the Lord there was someone who said to God,
\q1 “It's because I have compassion for Your Temple
\q2 that I'm ready to have trouble and be destroyed,
\q2 so that Your Temple will be honored.”\x + Ps. 69:10\x*
\p
\v 18 Then the leaders of the Jewish religion opposed Jesus by saying to Him, “Prove that you\f + \fr 2:18 \fk you \ft In this verse, the word used to replace the name of Jesus uses a lower case letter, because the ones speaking aren't believers in Jesus as the Son of God.\f* have the right to change our customs! What miracle will you show us to prove it?!”
\p
\v 19 Then Jesus answered them, “This will become the proof: Go ahead and tear down God's Temple, and I will rebuild it in just three days.”
\p
\v 20 And they said to Him, “This Temple was built over forty-six years time, and you say that you'll rebuild it in just three days?!”
\p
\v 21 But what Jesus meant by the words 'God's Temple' was His own body— not God's Temple in Jerusalem.
\v 22 In time to come, when Jesus came back to life from death, we disciples of His remembered that He had talked about this. For that reason, we truly believed the Word of the Lord and all the words of Jesus.
\p
\v 23 Jesus was in Jerusalem for the entire celebration of Passover. At the time, many people believed in Him because they saw the miracles He did.
\v 24 Even so, Jesus didn't want to get too close to them, because He knew what was in all of their hearts.
\v 25 He didn't need anyone to tell Him about other people, because He already knew everything that was in people's hearts.
