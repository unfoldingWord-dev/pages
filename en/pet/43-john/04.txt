\s Jesus talks with a Samaritan woman
\p
\v 1 The Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more followers than John.
\v 2 But it wasn't actually Jesus who baptized, but we, His disciples. Jesus knew that the Pharisees had heard about Him.
\v 3 So He left the Judean province with us, and returned to the province of Galilee again.
\v 4 On the way there, He had to go past the region of Samaria.
\p
\v 5 While in Samaria, Jesus, and we disciples of His, came to a village which is called Sychar. That village is located near the land which Jacob previously gave to Joseph, his son.
\v 6 And Jacob's well was there. Because the trip was long, Jesus felt very tired, so He sat by the edge of the well. It was about noon.
\v 7 Then a woman of Samaria came to draw water from the well. So Jesus said to her, “Please give me some water so I can drink.”
\v 8 While that was happening, we had gone to the village of Sychar to buy food.
\p
\v 9 Then the woman said to Him, “I'm amazed! How is it possible that you— a Jew, are asking for drinking water from me— a Samaritan!” She said that because Jews considered the Samaritans unclean.\f + \fr 4:9 \fr considered the Samaritans unclean \ft For example, at the time, the Jewish religious leaders had forbidden the Jews to use things that had been used by Samaritans. So according to that regulation, Jesus couldn't drink from the drinking vessel that had been used by the woman. At the time of Jesus, Jewish people couldn't associate with Samaritans, because the residents of Samaria weren't true Jews, but were descendants from mixed marriages between Jews and other tribes. In the Law of Moses, God had forbidden the Jews to have mixed marriages with other tribes. But those tribes had moved into the region of Palestine when most of the Jews had been taken away to Babylon. The Jewish people also weren't happy with the residents of Samaria because their religion wasn't pure Judaism. They mixed their religion with the customs of other tribes who entered the region when the Jews were exiled to Babylon.\f*
\p
\v 10 Then Jesus answered, “You don't know the gift that God wants to give you, and you don't know Me— who's asking you for water. If you had known Me, you certainly would have asked Me for living water first. And I'm ready to give it to you.”
\p
\v 11 Then the woman said, “Sir, you don't have a dipper, and this well is also very deep. How can you possibly give me that living water?”
\v 12 Jacob, our ancestor, is the one who gave this well to us. He and his children, and also all of his animals, used to drink the water from this well. Of course you don't feel you're greater than he was— do you?!”
\p
\v 13 Then Jesus answered, “Everyone who drinks water from this well will be thirsty again.
\v 14 But whoever drinks the water that I will give won't be thirsty forever. Because that water will become like a spring of water inside of him, which will always flow and give eternal life to him.”
\p
\v 15 The woman said, “Sir, give me that water so I won't get thirsty again and won't need to come here to draw water.”
\p
\v 16 Then Jesus said to her, “Go, call your husband and come back here with him.”
\p
\v 17 And the woman answered again, “But I don't have a husband.”
\p Then Jesus said to her, “What you said is really correct. You don't have a husband,
\v 18 because you've already been married and divorce five times with different men. And the man you're living with now isn't your husband. Yes, your words are definitely true.”
\p
\v 19 And she said, “Sir, I realizenow that you're a prophet.
\v 20 Our forefathers always worshiped God on this mountain, but you Jews say everyone has to worship God in Jerusalem.”
\p
\v 21 Then Jesus answered, “Believe what I'm telling you: In days to come you may worship God the Father anywhere, and you won't need to climb this mountain anymore, or go to Jerusalem.
\v 22 You Samaritans worship God, of course, yet you don't know Him. Whereas we Jews worship the God we already know. For God has promised that salvation will be given to mankind through the Jews.
\v 23 But the time will come, and actually has come now— when everyone who truly wants to worship God will worship Him through oneness with the Holy Spirit\f + \fr 4:23-24 \fk through oneness with the Holy Spirit \ft John literally wrote “spirit.” When John wrote this Gospel, the Greek language didn't yet differentiate between small and capital letters. All letters were like the capital letters used now. So Greek doesn't show whether Jesus meant the Holy Spirit or the spirit of man. About fifty percent of commentators say that Jesus intended “everyone … through his own spirit.” The translation team chose the interpretation that Jesus meant God's Spirit because of His words, “the time will come, and actually has come now”— which we consider to show a change in time periods, that is the giving of God's Spirit to God's people. This interpretation is also more likely because Jesus showed why people need the help of God's Spirit in verse 24a.\f* and according to true teachings from God. For God wants people who are like that to worship Him.
\v 24 For God isn't flesh, but Spirit. For that reason, everyone who wants to worship Him should worship Him in oneness with the Holy Spirit and according to true teaching from God.”
\p
\v 25 Then the woman said to Him, “I know that the Messiah will come later. When He comes, He'll tell us all the will of God for us.” 'Messiah' in the Hebrew language means 'Christ'.\f + \fr 4:25 \fk Christ \ft See the note in John 1:17.\f*
\p
\v 26 And Jesus said to her, “I— who am speaking to you, am the Messiah.”
\p
\v 27 At that moment, we disciples of His came back and reached the well. We were amazed when we saw Jesus talking to a woman. But none of us was bold enough to ask the woman, “What are you looking for?” And none of us asked Jesus, “Why are you talking to her?”
\p
\v 28 Then the woman left her water container there, and entered the village and said to the people who were there,
\v 29 “Come and see! There's someone over there who told me everything I've ever done! Could he possibly be the Christ?!”
\v 30 So the people went out of their village and came to Jesus.
\p
\v 31 But before they came, we urged Him to eat, saying “Teacher, come, let's eat!”
\p
\v 32 But He answered, “I have food that you don't know yet.”
\p
\v 33 Because of that we asked each other, “Is it possible that someone came and gave Him food?”
\p
\v 34 Then Jesus said to us, “My food is to do the will of the Father who sent Me into this world, which is to finish the work that He gave Me.
\v 35 People in general know and say, ‘After four months comes harvest time.’ But I say to you, open the eyes of your hearts! Look at these gardens. This wheat is ready to be harvested.
\v 36 I have ordered people to plant the wheat that we see now. I'm illustrating the souls of people who are being saved by wheat, and the people who are harvesting now illustrate us who work so that others can enter eternal life. Everyone who joins in harvesting will receive a reward that lasts forever. So in the end, those who planted this wheat before will rejoice with us who are harvesting it now.
\v 37 So the saying that we always hear is true: ‘There are those whose job is to plant, and there are also those whose job is to harvest.’
\v 38 I'm ordering you to harvest the produce in My field— where I gave others the job to plant before. Now you're ordered to just harvest the results of their labor.”
\p
\v 39 In the end, many Samaritans from that village believed in Jesus because they heard the testimony of the woman who said, “He told me about everything that I've ever done!”
\v 40 When those Samaritans got to Jesus, they asked Him to stay with them. Jesus agreed, and we stayed with them for two days.
\v 41 Then even more of the people of that village became believers because they themselves had heard His teaching.
\p
\v 42 And they said to that woman, “Of course, at first we believed in Him because of what you said. But now we believe because we've heard His teachings for ourselves. So now it's clear to us that He really is the King of Salvation for mankind.”
\s Jesus heals the son of a government official
\r (Matt. 8:5-13; Luke 7:1-10)
\p
\v 43 After two days at Sychar, Jesus left with us disciples of His for the province of Galilee.
\v 44 He Himself had taught that a prophet is seldom honored in his own region,
\v 45 but when He arrived, the Galileans received Him well. This happened because they were also present at the celebration of Passover in Jerusalem, so they had seen all that He had done there.
\p
\v 46 While in Galilee, Jesus returned to the village of Cana— where He'd changed the water into wine. That village wasn't far from the city of Capernaum. At the time, there was a government official who lived in that city. His son was sick
\v 47 and was almost dead. So when the official heard that Jesus had come from the province of Judea and was in Galilee, he went to Cana and pleaded with Him to immediately follow him to Capernaum to heal his son.
\v 48 But Jesus said to him and to all of the people who were there, “The people here don't want to believe in Me if they haven't seen miracles yet.”
\p
\v 49 So the man said to Him, “Sir, please come before my son dies!”
\p
\v 50 But Jesus answered, “You may go home to your house, because your son has been healed and didn't die.”
\p The official believed what Jesus said and immediately went home.
\v 51 On the way back to Capernaum, he met his servants who came from his house. They told him, “Your son is well.”
\p
\v 52 Then the official asked them, “What time did he get well?”
\p And they answered, “Yesterday afternoon, at one o'clock his fever disappeared.”
\p
\v 53 Then he remembered that it was exactly at that time also that Jesus said to him, “Your son is already well.” So he and all of his family became believers in Jesus.
\p
\v 54 So that was the second time that Jesus went home to Galilee from Judea and performed a miracle.
