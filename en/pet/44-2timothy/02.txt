\s Become a faithful soldier of Christ Jesus
\p
\v 1 Timothy my son, you should be continually strengthened by means of God’s amazing kindness— which we have because of being one with Christ.
\v 2 And you should also teach and entrust all of the teaching that you heard when I taught the brothers and sisters in the faith, to other brothers and sisters— especially to those who are able to teach, and who are faithful to give that teaching to other people.
\p
\v 3 Follow my example when you're made to suffer as a follower of Christ Jesus too. As His follower, you've become like a soldier in Christ's troops.
\v 4 A soldier doesn't busy himself with other different jobs, because he wants to please his commander.
\v 5 As another example: In a sports contest, a runner won't receive the victory prize\f + \fr 2:5 \fk victory prize \ft Literally, “crown.”\f* if he doesn't run according to the regulations of the contest.
\v 6 And for another example: A farmer who works hard deserves to be the first to enjoy the produce of the harvest that he planted.
\v 7 Think about these examples, and the Lord will give you the ability to understand these things more deeply.
\p
\v 8 Always think about Christ Jesus! He's the Descendant of David.\f + \fr 2:8 \fk Descendant of David \ft The prophets had prophesied that the King of Salvation would come from the descendants of King David. So all the Jews referred to the King of Salvation with the saying “Descendant of David.” See Isa. 29:18-19, 35:4-6, 42:6-7.\f* And He came back to life from death. That's the Good News I tell.
\v 9 But it's because I tell the news of salvation that I'm made to suffer! I'm bound with chains until now— as if I was a criminal. But God’s Word can't be imprisoned! There are still many brothers and sisters who keep on telling the news of salvation.
\v 10 So I'm willing to endure all kinds of suffering, because in that way I maintain the truth of the Good News, which is being told and believed. For by firmly enduring, I'm actually helping all of God's chosen people to have an opportunity to accept the salvation we get because we're one with Christ Jesus. In that way, they'll take part in enjoying His glory forever.
\p
\v 11 This saying is very worthy to be believed:
\q1 If we consider that we've died with Him,\x + Rom. 6:1-4, 12:1-2; Eph. 2:1-10; Col. 2:6-15, 3:1-6.\x*
\q2 we will also live with Him.
\q1
\v 12 If we remain faithful to Him— even in suffering,
\q2 we'll also rule with Him.
\b
\q1 But if we deny Him by saying, “I'm not a follower of Jesus,”
\q2 then He'll also say, “You aren't My follower.”
\q1
\v 13 Even so, if we aren't completely faithful to live according to His will,
\q2 He'll still be faithful to fulfill all of His promises to us,
\q2 because He can't deny His own words.
\s Try to be acknowledged by God
\p
\v 14 Keep reminding our brothers and sisters about all of these things, and advise them firmly before God, not to argue about useless things.\x + 1 Tim. 1:4, 4:7\x* Arguments like that can't produce anything good, but lead astray, so that the people who hear them are destroyed.
\v 15 Sincerely try to be acknowledged by God as a servant who's worthy to work for Him. You should become a servant who doesn't need to feel ashamed of your work, because you teach the true teaching from God accurately.
\p
\v 16 Don't get involved when people discuss a new teaching that isn't useful— that is teaching which doesn't come from God. Whoever involves himself in discussions like that will keep living farther away from God’s will.
\v 17 Teachings like that spread like a dangerous disease. Hymenaeus and Philetus are false teachers who teach things like that!
\v 18 The two of them have followed a misleading path, because they teach that God won't give us life again after death, for according to them, the only opportunity to be brought back to life has already happened.\f + \fr 2:18 \fk the only opportunity to be brought back to life has already happened \ft The basis of that false teaching isn't known now. But it certainly isn't far from the misleading teaching which Paul opposed in 1 Cor. 15.\f* In that way, they've confused the faith of some of our brothers and sisters.
\p
\v 19 But the true teaching from God\f + \fr 2:19 \fk true teaching … \ft In this verse, Paul Paul doesn't directly state what is the ‘foundation stone for us’. But there are commentators who say that what's meant is the whole unified church of Christ. See Eph. 2:19-22 and 1Tim. 3:15.\f* is like a great stone foundation for us followers of Christ. And these two sayings are written in large letters on that stone foundation:
\q “The Lord knows who already are His possessions, and who isn't His possession yet.”\x + Num. 16:5\x*
\m And
\q “Everyone who says: ‘I'm a follower of the Lord,’ must stop doing evil.”
\p
\v 20 Think about this example: In a luxurious house, there are different kinds of plates and other kitchen utensils that are made of precious materials— like gold and silver. And there are also those made of wood and clay. Those made of precious materials are only used for special occasions, whereas the ones made from cheap materials are used for everyday needs.
\v 21 It's the same with you! If you set yourself apart only for the Lord— by guarding yourself so that you keep living pure, you'll become like a special container. It means that you've become a container that's clean, and worthy to be used by the Lord for every good work.
\p
\v 22 But keep far away from everything that arouses lust and the desires of young people. Try hard to keep living right, remain confident in true teaching, keep showing love, and keep living peacefully with your fellowman. All of that needs to be done in fellowship with the brothers and sisters who (like yourself) ask for the Lord's help every day, with sincere hearts.
\v 23 And once again I'm ordering: Don't get involved in stupid debates about useless teaching, because you already know that debates like that only cause quarrels.
\v 24 And of course it's not proper for you, as a servant of the Lord, to quarrel. Instead, every servant of the Lord has to be friendly to everyone, skilled to teach, and patient in facing problems or troubles.
\v 25 And as a servant of the Lord, you should be gentle towards those who oppose you when you teach or point out their faults. For we work with the hope that the Lord will work in their hearts, so that they repent and accept true teaching.
\v 26 So our hope is that they can become aware again, and can get free of the trap of the devil, because it isn't just by chance that people follow wayward teaching. But they're deceived and bound by the devil, so that they become his cohorts.
