\s Character traits of people in this present age
\p
\v 1 My son, we should be aware that in these end times\x + 1Cor. 10:11; Heb. 1:2; 1Ptr. 4:7, 4:17; 1Jn. 2:18\x* we will certainly experience many difficulties.
\v 2 Many people will
\q1 love themselves, love money,
\q1 be arrogant and like to praise themselves,
\q1 like to insult other people, disobey their parents,
\q1 not know how to be thankful, not honor God,
\q1
\v 3 not love others, not forgive other people’s wrongs,
\q1 like to speak badly about others, be unable to control themselves,
\q1 be rude and cruel in character, and hate everything that's good.
\q1
\v 4 People in this last age will like to betray their friends,
\q1 not think wisely,
\q1 be arrogant and consider themselves to be more important than others,
\q1 and prefer to enjoy worldly pleasures rather than pleasing God’s heart.
\m
\v 5 Of course, in the eyes of others, they want to be considered religious followers, but they don't want to sincerely know God or be changed by His power! Stay far away from people like that.
\p
\v 6 For people like that are the ones who call themselves religious teachers, so that they're invited into other people’s homes. Then they deceive and trap women who aren't yet spiritually mature, and are too quick to believe anything, by that I mean women who feel the burden of their sin is really great because they let themselves be led here and there by all kinds of desires.
\v 7 Women like that are always ready to learn about spiritual things, but they obviously aren't able to distinguish between true teaching and false teaching.
\v 8 However, 'religious teachers' like that are like Jannes and Jambres\f + \fr 3:8 \fk Jannes and Jambres \ft Are names that were traditionally used by Jews for the sorcerers who opposed Moses in Pharoah's court. Their names aren't found in Ex. 7:11-12, 22.\f* who opposed Moses. Those teachers minds have become confused and they always oppose true teaching. What they believe doesn't actually make sense.
\v 9 But those false teachers won't succeed in trapping and misleading many people, for their stupidity will become very obvious, just like what happened to Jannes and Jambres.
\s Become a servant of the Lord like Paul
\p
\v 10 But my son, you've followed my teaching and example. The goal of my life has become the goal of your life. You and I have the same faith and patience. The way we love our fellowman and endure in trouble is also the same.
\v 11 In your own region, you clearly know how the residents of the cities of Antioch, Iconium and Lystra persecuted me and made me suffer. But remember that the Lord saved me from all of that!
\v 12 Every servant of Christ Jesus who sincerely wants to live to please God's heart will be persecuted.
\v 13 While evil people and false teachers will keep becoming more and more dangerous. They lead others astray, but they themselves are also lost.
\p
\v 14 For that reason Timothy, you should keep following the true teaching which I taught and which was taught by other servants of the Lord. You've believed that teaching because you know that we, who taught it, are trustworthy.
\v 15 And your faith is also based on the Holy Bible, which you've known since you were a small child. And through the Lord's Word you became wise, so that you received the salvation which we have because of believing in Christ Jesus.
\v 16 All of the Holy Bible was written according to God’s own words. And all of it is useful to teach, to rebuke, to show error, and to train us to live right in God’s eyes.
\v 17 So, through God's Word, we as God's servants are enabled and equipped to carry out every good task which God gives us.
