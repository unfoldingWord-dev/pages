\s John sees God's throne and the worship of Him in heaven
\p
\v 1 Then as the revelation continued, I saw that there was a door opened up above in heaven, and I heard a voice like before, that was as loud as a trumpet blast, which said, “Come up here! I will show you what has to happen after this.”
\v 2 Suddenly, I was controlled by the Holy Spirit, and it was like I had arrived in heaven where I saw a King's throne, and He who's Almighty was sitting on that throne!
\v 3 He, who was sitting on the throne, looked like jewels which sparkled in red, green, and several other colors. And the throne was surrounded by a rainbow which glittered like jewels.\f + \fr 4:3 \fk verse 3 \ft Literally, in the first sentence John wrote the names of two jewels— which are jasper and carnelian. In the second sentence, John mentions the gem called emerald, which can be of various colors— like a rainbow that has many colors too.\f*
\p
\v 4 Surrounding the throne, there were twenty-four other thrones, and twenty-four leaders who wore white robes and gold crowns sitting on those thrones.
\v 5 The throne of the Almighty King sent out flashes of lightning and loud sounds of rumblings and thunder. In front of His throne there were seven torches burning— which illustrate all the power of God's Spirit.\f + \fr 4:5 \fk all the power of God's Spirit \ft See the note in Rev. 3:1\f*
\v 6 And in front of the throne there was also something like a sea of glass which was transparent, like crystal.
\p Very close to the four corners of His throne were four living creatures which had many eyes all over their bodies— both in front and in back.
\v 7 The first living creature was like a lion. The second was like a male water buffalo. The third living creature's face was like the face of a human being. And the fourth was like an eagle with wings opened wide, as if it was flying.
\v 8 The four living creatures each had six wings, and all of their bodies had many eyes— even under their wings. They sang without stopping day and night,
\q1 “Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty!
\q2 He's the one who was from creation until now,
\q2 and who will continue to be until the next age.”
\p
\v 9-10 When the twenty-four leaders heard the living creatures sing praise, honor, and thanks to Him who lives forever, they also knelt down over and over again, worshiping in front of Him who sat on the throne. Then they placed each of their crowns before His throne as a sign that all glory is truly His alone. And at the same time they sang,
\q1
\v 11 “Oh our Lord God.
\q2 You're worthy to receive praise, honor and authority!
\q1 For You're the one who created everything.
\q2 And everything was created and continues to exist
\q2 only because of Your will.
