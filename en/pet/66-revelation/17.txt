\c 17
\s The vision about the prostitute and the evil beast
\p
\v 1 Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and said to me, “Come. I will show you the punishment that will fall on the prostitute who's well-known— that is she who sits in the place where many rivers flow.\f + \fr 17:1 \fk prostitute … rivers \ft In this chapter, it's clear that the prostitute and the red beast illustrate the city which John calls Babylon, but which is actually the city of Rome. The picture of many rivers fits Babylon, whereas the seven hills (verse 9) fit Rome. As in the following chapters, for us in this time, those two cities also illustrate the global government system which greedily promotes everything that arouses lustful desires and always opposes God and His people, because it's under the devil's leadership.\f*
\v 2 The kings of the earth have committed immoral acts with her, and all the residents of the earth have become drunk because of her wine.”\f + \fr 17:2 \fk analogy in verse 2 \ft “Committed adultery with her illustrates that the global government system will influence world leaders to worship idols. 'Become drunk because of her wine' illustrates the people who follow the worldly lifestyle which is full of lustful desires.\f*
\p
\v 3 Then I was suddenly controlled by the Holy Spirit and an angel carried me to a desert. I saw a woman there who was sitting on the back of a red-colored beast. Many names were written on the skin of that beast, all of which insulted God. That beast also had seven heads and ten horns.
\v 4 The woman wore very luxurious clothing which was purple and red in color. She was also adorned with different decorations of gold, jewels and pearls. She held a golden bowl, which was full of the wine of filthiness— that is unfaithfulness to God, and all kinds of immoral acts that defile.
\v 5 A name was written on her forehead that illustrates her true name— that is,
\pc I'm the great capitol city of Babylon—
\pc which is the mother of all prostitutes
\pc and the source of all defilement on earth.
\m
\v 6 Then I realized that this woman was drunk because of drinking blood, which was the blood of the people who were made holy by God— who were killed because they were faithful and not ashamed to testify about Jesus! So I looked at her with great amazement.
\p
\v 7 But the angel said to me, “Why are you amazed? I will explain the secret illustrated as the prostitute to you, and the beast which she's riding on— which has seven heads and ten horns.
\v 8 That beast illustrates a man who once lived on earth, but is dead now. He'll live again and appear from the world of the dead to become a king again. And all the residents of earth— that is everyone whose names weren't written in the Book of Life since the world was created, will be amazed to see that beast when it lives again. Then he'll be destroyed in hell.
\p
\v 9 “Whoever wants to explain the meaning of these things needs a wise mind. The seven heads of the beast are pillustrated by the seven hills which are the place where the woman sits, and they also illustrate seven great kings.
\v 10 Five of those kings have already died. The sixth of the kings is ruling now. The seventh king hasn't appeared yet, and when he appears he'll rule for just a short time.
\v 11 Now, like I said, that red beast used to live on earth, but now it isn't here anymore. He was one of the seven kings before. But when he lives again, he'll be counted as the eighth king. Then he'll be destroyed in hell.
\p
\v 12 “The ten horns, that you've seen also illustrate ten kings who'll rule over ten countries, but they haven't begun to rule yet. They'll receive authority to rule with the beast for just a short time.\f + \fr 17:12 \fk just a short time \ft Literally, “one hour.”\f*
\v 13 The ten kings will make an agreement to surrender all of their authority and military power to that beast.
\v 14 All of them will fight against the Lamb! But the Lamb will defeat them, because He's Lord over all lords and King over all kings. And His troops are His own chosen people— who are those that are called by Him and who are faithful to Him.”
\p
\v 15 Then the angel said to me, “The place where many rivers flow— which is the place where the prostitute sits, illustrates many groups of people, including all people groups, tribes, and groups that use a regional language.
\v 16 The ten horns— illustrating the kings, and the beast whom you saw, will hate the prostitute. They'll steal all of her treasures and clothing so that she's made naked. They'll capture her and eat her flesh. And finally, they'll destroy her body with fire.
\v 17 Actually, only God moves their hearts so that they make an agreement to do what is according to His plan. That's why they will surrender the authority of their kingdoms to that beast, so that all the will and words of God are fulfilled.
\v 18 And the vision about the prostitute illustrates the capitol city which rules over all the kings of the earth.”
