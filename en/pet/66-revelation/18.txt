\c 18
\s The vision of Babylon being destroyed
\p
\v 1 After that, I saw another angel come down from heaven. He had great authority, and the light of his glory illuminated the earth.
\v 2 The angel cried out in a very loud voice,
\q1 “Babylon has been destroyed!
\q2 The glorious capitol city has been destroyed!
\q1 And only demons and evil spirits live in that city.
\q1 The place that was previously full of life has become a place for filthy birds
\q2 which are hated by people.
\q1
\v 3 The punishment of God for that city is just,
\q1 because the kings of the earth have been influenced by the residents of that city in worshiping idols.
\q2 In God's eyes, that's like the sin of adultery.
\q1 And the punishment of God is just,
\q2 because all people groups have become dirty and unclean because they copied the lifestyle of the residents of that city, which is according to the lustful desires of the world.
\q2 It's as if all people groups became drunk with the wine which was given by the residents of that city.
\q1 As a result, the merchants of the earth became rich because of buying and selling all kinds of luxury items for them which they used to satisfy their lustful desires.”\x + Rev. 17:2\x*
\s God's warning to us who live in this time now
\p
\v 4 Then I heard the voice of the Lord Jesus from heaven which said,
\q1 “Oh My people, run away from that city!
\q2 Don't be influenced and join in sinning with them.
\q2 For in that way you'll also take part in being punished with various disasters with them.
\q1
\v 5 For the sin of the residents of that city is, as it were, piled up as high as the sky!
\q2 So God is ready to punish them in proportion to their wickedness.
\q1
\v 6 Oh, it's time! Let the residents of that city suffer in the way they've made My people suffer!
\q2 Because they've often made trouble for other people, may their trouble be two times that in proportion!
\q1 For they have, as it were, poisoned other people groups with their wine,
\q2 so now may they drink poison which is even stronger!
\q1
\v 7 Remember the way in which they each bragged about themselves.
\q2 So now let them feel very depressed.
\q1 Remember their lives that were so luxurious,
\q2 and now let them live with trouble and great anxiety.
\q1 Remember, they thought,
\q2 ‘We're the greatest people on earth!
\q2 We'll ever lack anything!
\q2 We won't be sad or mourn like a widow who no longer has a family.’
\q1
\v 8 Because of their arrogance, let various disasters fall on them suddenly!
\q2 So on the same day, let them experience starvation, death, mourning, and the disaster of being burned by fire!
\q1 For the Lord who judges them is the strong and powerful God!”
\s The wailing that will occur when the capitol of Babylon is destroyed
\p
\v 9 When the smoke of the destruction of the city of Babylon is seen, all of the kings of earth who had joined with the residents of that city in worshiping idols and living luxuriously to satisfy their lustful desires will cry and mourn.
\v 10 Those kings won't dare to get near that city, because they'll be afraid of getting the same torture. For that reason they'll watch from afar while wailing,
\q1 “Oh my, how truly horrifying! What a terrible disaster has fallen on that great capitol city!
\q2 How pitiful, because that city of Babylon used to be very great and strong!
\q1 But in just one hour the punishment of God has fallen on them!”
\p
\v 11 In the same way also, the merchants of the earth will cry and mourn because of that city, because the greatest market for their wares has been destroyed. So they'll say, “Who'll buy all of this?
\q2
\v 12 Who'll buy our gold, silver, jewels, and pearls?
\q2 And who else will buy our fine linen cloth, purple cloth, silk cloth, and scarlet cloth?
\q2 Who'll buy various types of items of fragrant smelling wood,
\q2 or items made of ivory, expensive wood, bronze, iron and marble?
\q2
\v 13 There are no more customers for our luxury items— including cinnamon, spices, perfumes, myrrh, and incense.
\q2 Who else will party and buy wine, olive oil, and fine flour?
\q2 There are no industry owners anymore that need wheat, bulls, and sheep.
\q2 What king will buy our horses and carts?
\q2 There are no rich people who'll buy our slaves!”
\q1 (It's truly horrifying! They even sold human souls!)
\p
\v 14 So the merchants will wail,
\q1 “Oh, how pitiful! For the residents of Babylon, all of the expensive things they wanted have vanished.
\q1 All of their luxury and beauty has been destroyed.
\q2 They won't find those things again!”
\m
\v 15 Those merchants used to become rich because of the merchandise they marketed there. But on seeing that disaster, they'll just watch from far away, because they're afraid that they'll come under the same torture. With weeping and mourning
\v 16 they say,
\q1 “Oh my, how horrible! What an awful disaster has fallen on the greatest capitol city!
\q2 How pitiful, because the citizens of that city used to wear fine linen, purple and red clothing every day.
\q2 And they were decked in gold, jewels and pearls every day.
\q1
\v 17 But in just one hour, all of their riches were destroyed!”
\p In the same way, every ship owner and captain, all ships' crews, and every marine merchant will watch the disaster from far away.
\v 18 When they see the smoke rising from the fire that burns the city, they'll say, “There was never a city as beautiful as that great capitol city!”
\v 19 So they'll mourn by putting ashes on their heads and while crying, they'll wail,
\q1 “Oh my, it's truly horrible! The disaster that fell on that great capitol city was so awful!
\q2 How pitiful! For we who used to be involved in marketing merchandise by ship became rich because of that city!
\q2 But in just one hour, all of that was destroyed!”
\p
\v 20 But there was a voice from heaven which cried out,
\q1 “Rejoice all of you residents of heaven, because that evil capitol city has been destroyed!
\q2 And God's messengers who prophesied, the apostles of Christ, and all the people who were made holy through Christ, you should rejoice.
\q1 For God has invoked punishment on the residents of that city in proportion to their wickedness toward you.”
\s An angel illustrates the destruction of Babylon
\p
\v 21 Then a strong angel picked up a large rock— as big as a millstone to grind flour, which is turned by the power of donkeys. Then the angel threw it into the ocean while saying,
\q1 “In a harsh way like this, the great city of Babylon will be destroyed—
\q2 so that it won't be found again!
\q1
\v 22 The sound of playing the harp, flute, trumpet, and other musical instruments
\q2 won't be heard there anymore.
\q1 There won't be anyone there any longer who's skilled at making luxurious merchandise.
\q1 In fact, the sound of the millstone grinding wheat won't be heard there again.
\q1
\v 23 Lamplight won't shine there anymore.
\q1 The sound of happiness from the groom and bride
\q2 won't be heard there again.
\q1 This punishment is caused because the merchants there became the richest in the world
\q2 based on the sorcery used by them to mislead and poison all people groups.
\q1
\v 24 And the blood of the prophets, God's messengers, and other people of God was found in that city.
\q2 And many murders done in other places were caused by the government of that capitol city.”
