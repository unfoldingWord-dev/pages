\s A beast from the ocean as a representative of the huge dragon
\p
\v 1 Then I saw a wild beast which appeared out of the ocean.\f + \fr 13:1 \fk wild beast … \ft This beast illustrates an evil spirit. Often in God's Word, the sea illustrates the powers of darkness in the world.\f* The beast had seven heads ten horns. On each head there was a crown, and on each head was written a name that insulted God— each name was different.
\v 2 The beast looked like a tiger. But its feet were really big, like the feet of a bear, and its mouth was like a lion's mouth. Then the terrible dragon gave his own authority and power to the beast, so that the wild beast represented the dragon as the high king of earth— even sitting on the dragon's throne.
\p
\v 3 One of the heads of the beast looked like it had gotten a very severe and fatal wound, but the wound had healed. All the people on earth were surprised and amazed, so they followed and obeyed the beast, because they thought the healing of its head was a miracle.
\v 4 They also worshiped the dragon, because he's the one who gave the authority to rule to the beast, and they also worshiped the beast saying, “There certainly isn't a more powerful being than that beast! And no being at all is capable of making war against him!”
\p
\v 5 These things happened because the beast was given permission by God to rule as king for forty-two months.\f + \fr 13:5 \fk forty-two months \ft See the note in Rev. 11:2-3.\f* In fact, the beast was permitted to continuously praise itself and insult God.
\v 6 So without stopping, the beast insulted God— His name, His Temple in heaven, and all of the residents of heaven.
\v 7 That beast also was given permission to make war against the people of God and defeat them— that is those who were made holy by Him because of Christ. In fact, the beast was given authority to rule every country, people group, tribe and every group that uses a regional language.
\v 8 Almost everyone who lives on earth will worship that beast— that is everyone whose name hasn't been written in the Lamb's Book of Life since the world was created. However it's the Lamb who's worthy to be worshiped, because He's the One who surrendered Himself to be the sacrifice to erase sin.
\p
\v 9 For that reason, listen— each of you who has ears! It's really important that each of us understand God's will concerning the end of the age:
\q1
\v 10 “Each of us who has been determined by God to be taken captive will certainly be taken captive.
\q1 Each of us who has been determined to be killed by a sword will certainly be killed by a sword.”
\m This means that God wants each of us who've been made holy by God to keep enduring ,and be faithful to Christ in persecution!
\s A beast from the land as a representative of the huge dragon
\p
\v 11 Then I saw another beast appear from the land. That beast had two horns like a lamb, but he deceived like the dragon with his words.
\v 12-14 Then the beast from the sea gave its full authority to the beast that came out of the land. So with the full right as his representative, the second beast forced all of the residents on earth to worship the first beast—that is the beast which had recovered from the fatal sword wound. And to convince mankind, the second beast did various great miracles— even bringing down fire from the sky to earth before the eyes of all people.
\p So, because of the ability and authority to do miracles that was given by the first beast, the second beast led almost all of the residents on earth astray. Then he ordered them to make an idol in the form of the first beast.
\v 15 Then with the authority that was given by the first beast, the second beast gave life to the idol so that it could speak. And when the idol spoke, it gave this order, “Whoever doesn't kneel and worship me has to be killed!”
\v 16 Then the second beast forced everyone to receive a sign of worshiping the first beast on his hand or on his forehead. Everyone was forced to receive that sign— both people of high position and the lowly, both rich people and poor, both slaves and free.
\v 17 It meant that no one could buy or sell anything at all if they didn't have that sign. The sign of worship used a number as a symbol that shows the name of the first beast.
\p
\v 18 This needs wisdom to understand the meaning of the number which is used as a symbol of the name of the first animal, because the number indicates a person.\f + \fr 13:18 \fk a person \ft This word can also be translated ‘people’.\f* And the number is 666.\f + \fr 13:18 \fk number 666 \ft Just like the numbers seven and twelve often have symbolic meaning, so does the number six. The number seven indicates things that are complete, perfect or godly. (Rev. 3:1) Whereas the number six indicates things that are incomplete, imperfect, worldly and the possession of the devil. Also, because the Greek capitol letters were often used to indicate numbers, many interpreters say that the name of the person indicated is the King of Rome named Nero— who ruled Rome when John was imprisoned.\f*
