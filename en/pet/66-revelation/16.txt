\c 16
\s The seven bowls full of God's wrath are poured out on the earth
\p
\v 1 Then I heard a voice from God's tent which cried out to the seven angels, “Go and pour out the seven bowls full of the wine of God's wrath onto the earth.”
\p
\v 2 The first angel went to pour out the contents of his bowl on the earth. Then severe and disgusting boils on appeared on everyone who had received the sign of worshiping of the beast and its idol.
\p
\v 3 The second angel poured out the contents of his bowl on the ocean. Then the ocean became dark red blood— like a dead person's blood. So everything that lived in the ocean died.
\p
\v 4 The third angel poured out the contents of his bowl on all of the rivers and springs of water. Then all of them became blood.
\v 5 Then I heard the angel who had authority over all the ocean, rivers, and springs of water cry out,
\q1 “These punishments of Yours are very just,
\q2 oh one and only God Most Holy—
\q2 since the beginning and until now!
\q1
\v 6 Because those people are the ones who poured out the blood
\q2 of Your people and the blood of all Your prophets and messengers,
\q1 and now You have forced them to drink blood!
\q2 This punishment is appropriate to their deeds!”
\m
\v 7 Then I heard a voice from the golden altar\x + Rev. 6:9\x* which cried out,
\q1 “Oh Lord, God Almighty,
\q2 You invoke punishments justly and righteously!”
\p
\v 8 The fourth angel poured out the content of his bowl on the sun. Then fire came out of the sun which burned mankind.
\v 9 As a result, people experienced many burns that were very severe and disgusting. So they insulted God, because they realized that all these disasters happened because of His authority. But they still didn't want to repent and didn't want to glorify God.
\p
\v 10 The fifth angel poured out the contents of his bowl over the throne of the first beast. Then all of the region of his authority became very dark. And people felt terribly tortured because of fear and pain.\f + \fr 16:10 \fk felt terribly tortured … \ft Literally, “gnawed their tongues in (order to endure the unusually great) anguish.”\f*
\v 11 So because of the boils, large burns, and feelings of torture, they insulted God in heaven even more. And they still didn't want to repent from all of their wickedness.
\p
\v 12 The sixth angel poured out the contents of his bowl on the great Euphrates River. Then the water of that river dried up. This happened according to God's plan, to prepare a road for the kings of the east who would come and lead their soldiers across that river.
\v 13 Then I saw three evil spirits that looked like frogs. The three evil spirits each came out of the mouth of the dragon, from the mouth of the first beast, and from the mouth of the second beast. (The second beast was the one who worked as a false prophet who led people astray by the authority of the first beast.)
\v 14 Those three spirits are demons that have authority to perform various miracles. In that way they will persuade the kings of the whole world to gather their soldiers to fight on the final day of battle which has been determined by God the Almighty.\x + Rev. 19:11-15\x*
\v 15-16 Then the three demons gathered all of the kings of the earth together with their soldiers, at a place called Armageddon in the Hebrew language.
\p But the Spirit of Christ said, “Listen! I'm coming suddenly like a thief. Truly blessed is each of you who's on guard and doesn't stain himself by doing evil! You're the ones who'll be considered worthy to wear white robes, and in that way you won't feel ashamed before My people because you don't have heavenly clothing.”\f + \fr 16:15 \fk Verse 15 \ft What is translated , 'doesn't stain himself', is literally, “guards (so that he doesn't lose) his robe.” It means showing holiness in living, as seen in Rev. 3:4. The last part, in a more literal way is, “so that he doesn't walk naked and isn't ashamed in the eyes of other people.” In Bible times, the word ‘naked’ was also used for not wearing outer robes but still wearing undergarments. (For an example, see NET Is. 20:3.) The important thing in this verse is that evidently holiness in our lives on earth will be seen in heaven through the clothing we will be given.\f*
\p
\v 17 The seventh angel poured out the contents of his bowl on the air of earth. Then a voice came out from the throne of God which was in that Most Holy Room, which cried out, “Everything is finished!”
\v 18 Then lightning, loud crashing noises, thunder, and a terrible earthquake happened. From the time since mankind was on earth, there has never been an earthquake like this. This was the most terrible earthquake.
\v 19-20 The great city that we often call Babylon\f + \fr 16:19 \fk often call Babylon \ft John and Peter (1 Pet. 5:13) used the name Babylon to replace an actual name— which was Rome. That name reminds us of when the people of Israel were exiled to the land of Babylon. Before that, the capitol city of Babylon was like Rome— which was a very harsh and evil kingdom toward the people of God.\f* was destroyed and split into three parts. So God didn't forget to punish the great Babylon because of His wrath. Because of the evil that was done by the kings and residents of that city, a horrifying punishment fell upon them, and it's as if they were forced to drink poisoned wine from God. There were also many cities in other lands which were destroyed by that earthquake. Every island disappeared completely. All themountains were destroyed and became level.
\v 21 Also hail like stones each as heavy as forty kilograms fell down from the sky on top of people.\f + \fr 16:21 \fk forty kilograms \ft Literally, “one talent.”\f* Then people insulted God even more because of the disaster of hail that was so horrible.
