\s Introduction by John
\p
\v 1 This book's contents are about the events which have been determined by God to happen soon. In the beginning, His plans were revealed by God to Christ Jesus, then Christ sent an angel to show all of that to me, John— Christ's servant, through a vision.
\v 2 In this book I write my own testimony about all that was shown to me, and all God's messages which were given to me by Christ Jesus.
\p
\v 3 Each person who reads this book to other people is blessed, and everyone who hears and pays close attention to all that's written in this book is also blessed! For the time determined by God for these events to take place is near.
\p
\v 4 I— John, send greetings to the Brothers and Sisters in the faith who are in the seven churches in the province of Asia. I pray that God will always be kind to each of you and guard you so that your lives are calm under His protection. For all the blessings which we receive come
\q1 from God who has existed since creation until now, and who will continue to exist until the age to come;
\q2 and from God's Spirit, who with all of His power\f + \fr 1:4 \fk God's Spirit, who with all of His power \fk Literally, “the seven spirits.” Many commentators say that “the seven spirits” here are the same as “the seven Spirits of God” which are found in Rev. 3:1, 4:5 and 5:6. See the footnote in Rev. 3:1.\f* is before God's throne;
\q1
\v 5-6 and from Christ Jesus, who can always be believed in all of His testimony about God the Father.
\q2 He is the very first\f + \fr 1:5 \fk very first \fk Literally, “Firstborn Son.” Jesus is often called the “Firstborn Son” in God's Word because the firstborn son has a special role in Jewish culture. The firstborn son is the one who will inherit everything from his father, and becomes the leader of all the other children. This means that Jesus is the first to possess eternal life after death (Col. 1:18; Rev. 1:5), the Supreme of all who've been created (Ps. 89:28; Col. 1:15; Heb. 1:6), the Ruler over all other children adopted by God (Rom. 8:29: Heb. 2:10-14), and the One who is the guarantee that all followers of Christ will be brought back to life from death (1 Cor. 15:20).\f* to have eternal life after death,
\q2 and He's the High King over all the kings of the earth.
\p I pray that Christ will be glorified forever! Because of His very amazing love for us, He surrendered Himself to be crucified, so that through His own blood we are freed from the power of sin. In that way, He has made us citizens of God's kingdom, and priests\x + 1Ptr. 2:5, 2:9; Why. 5:10\x* who serve God— His Father, in a spiritual way. May glory and power be given to Christ Jesus forever and ever! Amen!
\p
\v 7 Look, Jesus is coming surrounded by clouds! All mankind who have died will be brought back to life, and everyone will witness His coming— including those who pierced Him. Then all the people groups on earth will cry with loud wailing, because they know that He's coming to judge them. It's true, that's what will happen! Amen!
\p
\v 8 And the Lord God said, “Only I am worthy to be called ‘the First and the Last.’\f + \fr 1:8 \fk the First and the Last \fk Literally, “Alpha and Omega”— which are the first and last letters in the Greek language alphabet. John gives the meaning of “Alpha and Omega” in this verse.\f* And I am the Almighty who has existed from before creation until now, and who will always exist forever and ever.”
\s The way Christ revealed Himself to John
\p
\v 9 I, John, am your brother in the faith who has also often experienced persecution like what you're experiencing because of following Jesus. For that reason, we learn to endure in our faith in Him and become patient in waiting for the time when God visibly rules as King in this world. Because I told the Word of God and bore witness about Jesus, I was also arrested, and then exiled and imprisoned by the government of the kingdom of Rome, on the island of Patmos.\f + \fr 1:9 \fk Patmos \fk A small island in the Mediterranean Sea. Its location is near the country which is now called Turkey.\f*
\v 10 On the Lord's Day— which is Sunday, I was suddenly controlled by the Holy Spirit, then close behind me, I heard a loud voice like the sound of a trumpet blast
\v 11 which said, “Write down all of these things that will be shown to you, then send that book to the seven churches in the cities of the province of Asia— that is to Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea.
\p
\v 12 So I turned around behind me to see Who was speaking to me. Then I saw seven lamps which each stood on a special table, and all of them were made of gold.
\v 13 And between those seven lamps there was Someone who looked like “a normal human being”— that is the Son of Man.\f + \fr 1:13 \fk Son of Man \fk When Jesus lived on earth, He often called Himself “the Son of Man.” But the meaning of this term isn't directed at the word “son.” In the Hebrew language, “son of man” means “normal human being.” Jesus called Himself that to remind His listeners about what the Prophet Daniel had witnessed in a vision of the King of Salvation. (Dan. 7:13-14) For Daniel saw Him in heaven in the form of “a son of man”— meaning in the form of a “normal human being,” when God appointed Him King over everything there is.\f* He wore a long robe that reached to His feet. He also wore a gold belt which was so wide that it came up to His chest.
\v 14 His hair was white like sheep's wool, or as white as snow. His eyes shone like flames of fire.
\v 15 His feet seemed to have the glow of brass that is being purified in a very hot fire. His voice was as loud as a gigantic waterfall.
\v 16 His right hand held seven stars. His tongue was like a sharp two-edged sword— which illustrates that all His words are very powerful. And His face shone like the sun at mid-day.
\p
\v 17 When I saw Him, I immediately fell headlong in front of Him, and felt like all of my strength was gone— like I died on the spot. Then He put His right hand on me and said, “Don't be afraid! I'm the one who always is— both before the beginning of creation and after all creation passes away.
\v 18 I am the source of life. Even though I died, yet look! I'm alive now, and will live forevermore! I hold the key to the kingdom of death, so I hold complete power to determine when each person will die, and I have power to cause people to live again after death.
\p
\v 19 “For that reason, write down everything that will be shown to you, because all of these visions illustrate the situation that's going on now, and also events which will happen in days to come.
\v 20 I will explain the meaning of the two previous visions now: The seven stars you saw in My right hand illustrate the seven servants of the Lord\f + \fr 1:20 \fk servants of the Lord \fk This word in the Greek language can also be translated 'angel', as in Rev. 1:1. The root meaning of the word ‘angel’ is ‘messenger,’ and in the Greek language that word is often used for human messengers too.\f* who represent the seven churches in the cities named, whereas the seven gold lamps illustrate the seven churches.”\f + \fr 1:20 \fk the seven churches \fk The number seven in all of the Revelation of John has a symbolic meaning. It's quite likely that the seven churches illustrate all of the churches who believe in Christ. See also Rev. 3:1 and the note.\f*
