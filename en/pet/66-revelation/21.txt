\s The new Jerusalem
\p
\v 1 Then I saw the new heaven and new earth, because the first heaven and the first earth had vanished, and there was no ocean anymore.
\v 2 Then I saw the holy city of God— which is the new Jerusalem, as God was causing it to descend from heaven. That city is so beautiful. Its beauty can be illustrated by a bride that has been adorned at the time of her wedding to the groom.\x + Rev. 19:7-8, Eph. 5:27\x*
\p
\v 3 Then I heard a voice near the throne of God which cried out,
\q1 “From now on, God will live with mankind.
\q1 So, now God has fulfilled His promise which He gave through the prophets,
\q2 ‘I Myself will live with you.
\q2 You'll be My people,
\q2 and I will be your God.’”\x + Jer. 24:7, 30:22, 31:33, 32:38; Zach. 8:8\x*
\q1
\v 4 He also said, ‘I will wipe away all their tears.’\x + Is. 25:8; Rev. 7:17\x* They won't experience death or pain anymore, and they won't mourn or cry again, because the old way of life is no more.”
\p
\v 5 He who sits on that throne says, “Look! I'm making everything new!” Then He said again, “Write these things dwon, because all of My warnings are true and worthy to be believed.”
\p
\v 6 Then He who sits on the throne said to me, “Look! Everything is finished! I'm the one called the 'Alpha and Omega'— who's your one and only God and who always is, both before the beginning of creation, and after all of this creation is done away. Anyone who is thirsty, come! I will give him water freely— that is water from the spring that puts out living water!\x + Is. 55:1; Rev. 22:1\x*
\v 7 All of you who remain faithful to Me and win in this spiritual battle will receive all of the blessings mentioned. You're worthy to be called 'My children', and I'm happy to be called 'your Father'.
\v 8 But those blessings mentioned above will never be received by people like these:
\q1 cowards, murderers, idol worshipers,
\q1 sorcerers, deceivers,
\q1 those who are unfaithful to Jesus,
\q1 those who defile themselves by committing immorality or other various kinds of revolting sins.\f + \fr 21:8 \fk the list of sins \ft The order of the sins was changed so that its more natural in the Indonesian language and easier to read.\f*
\m They'll be thrown into the ocean of fire mixed with sulfur.” (That's what's called the “second stage of death.”)
\p
\v 9 Then that angel\f + \fr 21:9 \fk that angel \ft John's words can also be interpreted that this angel is one of the seven angels previously mentioned, and not the one mentioned in Rev. 17:1 and 19:10.\f* came to me again. He's one of the seven angels that poured out the seven bowls full of the seven final disasters. He said, “Come here. I will show you the bride of the Lamb— that is the unity of all people who believe, who is, so to speak, married to Him.”\x + Eph. 1:23, 3:10, 5:27; Rev. 19:7-8\x*
\v 10 Then the Holy Spirit controlled me again, and the angel took me to the top of a very great, high mountain. From there he showed me the holy city— which is the new Jerusalem that God brought down from heaven.
\v 11 That city is full of the glory of God, and everything shines like a jewel that's really clear— like crystal the color of green mixed with red.\f + \fr 4:3 \fk green mixed with red \ft Literally, John wrote the name of a jewel— which is jasper.\f*
\v 12-13 That city has huge walls that are very high. And the walls have twelve gates— three gates on each side, three gates on the east side, three gates on the north side, three gates on the south side, and three gates on the west side. And each gate is guarded by an angel. One of the names of each of the twelve tribes of Israel is written above each gate.
\v 14 The walls of the city have twelve foundation stones. One of the names of each of the twelve apostles of the Lamb is written on each foundation stone.
\p
\v 15 The angel who spoke to me held a measuring rod made of gold, so that he could measure that city— including the twelve gates, and the walls.
\v 16 The city is shaped like a cube— the length, width, and height are the same. And when the angel measured the city with his rod, its length was 12,000 stadia. The width and height were also the same.\f + \fr 21:16 \fk 12,000 stadia \ft The literal measurement is used directly in this translation, because the number 12 has a symbolic meaning, like the number of gates and foundation stones in the city. 12,000 stadia is the same as 2,220 km. Because the length, width, and height are the same, it means that the holy city could be shaped like a cube or a pyramid.\f*
\v 17 Then the angel also measured the width of the wall, and it was 144 hasta.\f + \fr 21:17 \fk width … hasta \ft The measurement hasta is kept in this translation because the total of 144 is the same as 12 times 12. 144 hasta is 66 meters. It isn't clear in the Greek language if the measurement is the height of the walls, (which isn't the same as the height of the city,) or the width of the walls.\f* The measurements mentioned are according to those used by the angel, and are no different than the measurements used by people on earth.
\p
\v 18 The walls of the city were made from a clear jewel the color green mixed with red, whereas all of the structures in the city were made of gold that's very pure— as clear as glass.
\v 19 The twelve foundation stones of the city wall were decorated with all kinds of jewels. Whereas each foundation stone was made of one very large stone.
\q1 The first foundation stone was made of a green jewel mixed with red, the second was a dark blue jewel,
\q1 the third was a light green jewl, the fourth was a dark green jewel,
\v 20 the fifth was a red jewel, the sixth was a dark red jewel,
\q1 the seventh was a yellow jewel, the eighth was a blue jewel mixed with green,
\q1 the ninth was a clear jewel, the tenth was a green jewel,
\q1 the eleventh was a blue jewel, and the twelfth was a purple jewel.\f + \fr 21:19-20 \fk twelve jewels \ft The names of the jewels in the Greek language in these two verses are often translated as follows: jasper, sapphire, chalcedony (agate), emerald, onyx (sardonyx), carnelian, chrysolite (yellow quartz), beryl, topaz, chrysoprase (turquoise), jacinth and amethyst.\f*
\v 21 And the twelve gates were each made of one amazing pearl. The main street in the middle of the city was made of gold that was so pure, that it sparkled like clear glass.
\p
\v 22 I didn't see God's Temple in the city, because the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb Himself have become God's Temple for the city.
\v 23 That city doesn't need the sun and moon to illuminate it, because the glory of God shines like the sun. And the radiance of the Lamb is like the lamp that illuminates the city.
\v 24 The lives of all people groups will be illuminated by the radiance of that city. And all the kings of earth will come bringing their own kingdom's treasures to the city as an offering to glorify God and the Lamb.\x + Is. 60:3\x*
\v 25 The gates of the city will never be closed, because there's no more night there.
\v 26 All kinds of riches from all people groups will be brought into the city to glorify and honor God and the Lamb.
\v 27 But no unclean things at all will be brought into the city. Whoever makes himself unclean with great sin won't be allowed to enter, and the same with all liars too. Only the people whose names are written in the Lamb's Book of Life can enter that city.
