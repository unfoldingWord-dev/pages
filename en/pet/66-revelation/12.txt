\s The vision of a glorious woman and the dragon that opposed her
\p
\v 1 A meaningful sign was shown to me: I saw a very glorious woman in the sky. She wore a shining robe, as if it was made from the sun. The moon was under her feet and she wore a crown made of twelve stars.
\v 2 But she was pregnant and it was already time for her to give birth. Because of that she screamed in pain.
\p
\v 3 Then another sign in the sky was seen— which was a huge red dragon which had seven heads and ten horns. There was a crown on each of its heads.
\v 4 Then the dragon pulled one third of the stars with its tail and threw them down to the earth. After that, the dragon stood in front of the pregnant woman in order to eat her Child as soon as He was born.
\p
\v 5 Then the woman gave birth to a boy Child. This is the Child who was prophesied about by a prophet by saying that He will have great power to “rule over all people groups.” And His power is illustrated by “a rod of iron which easily destroys ceramic pots.”\x + Ps. 2:7-9; Rev. 2:27, 19:15\x* But as soon as the Child was born, He was suddenly taken away and brought to God, to rule with God next to His throne.
\v 6 Whereas the women fled to the desert, to a place that had been prepared by God for her. In that place she will be cared for by angels for 1, 260 days.\f + \fr 12:6 \fk 1, 260 days \ft See the note in Rev. 11:2-3.\f*
\p
\v 7 Then a war took place in heaven! Michael and the angels who were under his command fought against that huge dragon. The dragon fought with the help of the angels who had been on his side to oppose God since before creation.
\v 8 But the dragon was defeated! So he and all of the angels who were on his side were driven out of heaven.
\v 9 So the huge dragon and everyone who was on his side were thrown down to the earth. He's the snake whom we know in the events that happened in the garden of Eden, who's called the devil, and named Satan, and who likes to deceive people in the whole world.
\p
\v 10 Then I heard an extremely loud heavenly voice cry out,
\q1 “The time has now come when God will use His power!
\q2 God will establish His kingdom in reality
\q2 and Christ will rule as King with Him!
\q2 His victory will be seen in individually in all of His people whom He has saved!
\q1 Because the devil— who always accuses our brothers and sisters in the faith, day and night before God,
\q2 has been thrown out of heaven.
\q1
\v 11 Our brothers and sisters have defeated the devil because they completely believe
\q2 in the victory of the Lamb when His blood was poured out for them.
\q2 And they won, because they weren't ashamed to witness about their King of Salvation.
\q1 They didn't take pity on their own lives— even to the point of being willing to die.
\q1
\v 12 For that reason rejoice, all you residents of heaven!
\q1 But how unfortunate are all you residents of the earth— both you on the land and you in the sea,
\q2 for the devil has been thrown down.
\q1 He's in your midst, and he's very angry,
\q2 because he realizes that the time to oppose God is almost gone.”
\p
\v 13 When the huge dragon realized that he had been throne down to the earth, he chased the woman who gave birth to the boy Child, in order to hurt her.
\v 14 But God gave two large wings to the woman— like the wings of an eagle, in order to fly to the desert to the place that had been prepared for her. She was taken care of there, far from the dragon, for three and a half years.
\v 15 Then the dragon spit water out of his mouth, like a huge river, flowing in the direction of the woman, so he could harm the woman through that river.
\v 16 But the woman got help, because by God's command a hole opened up in the ground that swallowed the water which the dragon spit out.
\v 17 So the dragon got very angry with the woman, then he went to make war against all of her other children— that is we who obey the commands of God and faithfully tell the teachings of Jesus.
\p
\v 18 Then the dragon stood on the shore.
