\c 8
\s The Lamb releases the seventh seal
\p
\v 1 When the Lamb released the last seal of the scroll, heaven became still and silent for almost half an hour.
\v 2 Then I saw the seven well-known angels\f + \fr 8:2 \fk seven angels … \ft According to a Jewish tradition, there are seven angels who always stand before the Lord. One of them is named Raphael, who is mentioned in the book of Tobit 12:15. (The book of Tobit is included in the Old Testament of the Catholic church.) And one of the others is Gabriel. (Luke 1:19)\f* come forward and stand in front of God. And they were given seven trumpets.
\p
\v 3 Then one of the other angels came and stood near the golden altar— the place for offering incense before God. That angel held a golden pan which was used to burn incense. And he was given a lot of incense to offer God. The angel mixed the incense in the pan with fire, which he took from the altar. The incense was offered to God, to illustrate the prayers of all of His people.
\v 4 Then a cloud of incense smoke arose before God from the pan that was in the angel's hand. This illustratea the prayers of all of God's people.
\v 5 After that, the angel filled the pan with fire from the altar again, and then threw it onto the earth! Then the sound of rumblings of thunder occured, along with continuous lightning and an earthquake.
\s Each of the seven angels blow their trumpets
\p
\v 6 After that, the seven angels who held the seven trumpets each prepared to blow their trumpets.
\p
\v 7 The first angel blew his trumpet, then there was hail, and fire mixed with blood fell onto the earth. So one third of the earth and one third of the trees were burned up, and all the green grass was burned up.
\p
\v 8 The second angel blew his trumpet, and then something that looked like a huge burning mountain was thrown into the sea. So one third of the sea became blood,
\v 9 and one third of the living creatures in the sea died, and one third of all the ships were destroyed too.
\p
\v 10 The third angel blew his trumpet, and then a huge star that was burning like a torch fell from the sky. That star fell on one third of the rivers and the springs of water on earth.
\v 11 The name of that star was Bitterness.\f + \fr 8:11 \fk Bitterness \ft Literally, “Absinthe.” Absinthe (wormwood) is a kind of plant that is very bitter and is used as a medicine. But according to tradition, it's also considered to be a poison. Here absinthe illustrates great sorrow and natural disasters that poison mankind.\f* And one third of all the water became very bitter, and many people died because of drinking that bitter water.
\p
\v 12 The fourth angel blew his trumpet, then the sun, the moon, and the stars were struck. Because of that, the sun didn't shine for twelve hours any longer, but only for eight hours. And also the moon and stars shone for only one third of the time. As a result there was often very great darkness on the earth.
\p
\v 13 Then I saw something important! I heard an eagle that flew in the sky and cried out this announcement: “How unfortunate! How unfortunate! It will be so unfortunate for those who live on earth because of the sound of the trumpets that will be blown by the other three angels!”
