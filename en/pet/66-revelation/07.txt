\s 144,000 people are given the stamp of God'
\p
\v 1 After that happened, I saw four more angels standing at the four corners of the earth. They held back the four winds of the earth— that is the east, west, north and south, so that the winds didn't blow anywhere— either on the land, on the sea, or on the trees.
\v 2 Those four angels had received authority from God to ruin the earth and sea. But then I saw another angel who appeared from the east, who brought a stamping tool that was used to give a stamp as a sign of being owned by the living God. Then the other angel cried out to the four angels,
\v 3 “Don't ruin the earth, the sea, or the trees until we put a stamped sign on the forehead of everyone who serves God.”
\p
\v 4 Then I heard that the total number of those who were given the stamped sign was 144,000 people, who came from all the tribes of Israel.
\q1
\v 5 So there were 12,000 from each tribe, including the tribes of Judah, Reuben, Gad,
\q1
\v 6 Asher, Naphtali, Manasseh,
\q1
\v 7 Simeon, Levi, Issachar,
\q1
\v 8 Zebulun, Joseph, and Benjamin.
\m From each of those tribes, 144,000 people were given the stamped sign of God.\f + \fr 7:8 \fk each tribe \ft The list of the tribes of Israel— who is also called Jacob, differs from the twelve tribes that are listed in the Old Testament. Here Levi and Joseph replace Dan and Ephraim. In the Old Testament, Levi and Joseph weren't usually counted. Many interpreters say that the numbers 12,000 and 144,000 are symbolic numbers— whose meaning isn't literal. Interpreters have different opinions about the names of the tribes of Israel here. Some of them say that the list indicates just Jewish people, whereas others say that these are actually people of any tribe who've become the people of God through believing in Christ.\f*
\s A gathering of people that can't be counted from every country, ethnic group, tribe, and language
\p
\v 9 Then I saw such a huge number of people whose total couldn't be counted— who came from every country, ethnic group, tribe and language. They all stood in front of God's throne and in front of the Lamb wearing white robes and holding palm branches.
\v 10 They cried out, “Praise to You, Oh our God, who sits on the throne of Your kingdom! We were saved because of You and the Lamb whom You sent!”
\p
\v 11 The angels, the twenty-four leaders, and four living creatures were still standing around God's throne. When they heard praises from that huge number of God's people, all of them immediately fell down headlong in front of God's throne and worshiped Him.
\v 12 They all cried out, “Amen! To God be all praise, glory, wisdom, thanksgiving, honor, authority and power forever. Amen!”
\p
\v 13 Then one of the leaders asked me, “Do you know who these are who are wearing white robes, and where they came from?”
\p
\v 14 I answered him, “I don't know, Sir. Please tell me.”
\p And he said to me, “They're the people who've come out of very severe persecution. They've washed their robes in the blood of the Lamb, and His blood is also what made their robes white.
\v 15 That's why they have the right to come before the throne of God, and they worship before God day and night with enthusiasm, here in His heavenly Home. And He who sits on the throne of His kingdom will keep protecting them.
\v 16 They won't ever be hungry and thirsty again. And even if the sun shines with mid-day heat, it won't bother them anymore.\x + Ps. 121:6\x*
\v 17 Because the Lamb who's closest to the throne of God, will shepherd them and guide them to the source of water which gives life. And God will ‘wipe away all of the tears from their eyes.’”\x + Is. 25:8; Rev. 21:4\x*
