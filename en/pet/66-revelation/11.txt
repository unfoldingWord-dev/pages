\c 11
\s Two witnesses will prophesy and then be killed
\p
\v 1-2 Then one of the angels gave a measuring tool like a rod to me and said, “Go to Jerusalem and measure God's Temple and its altar. And count the number of those who worship there. But don't measure the courtyard of God's Temple, because that place has been given as a place of prayer for the non-Jewish people groups. And God has determined that those people groups will control the Holy City (Jerusalem) and oppress its inhabitants for forty-two months.
\v 3 And I will give authority to two male witnesses who will witness and prophesy for 1,260 days.\f + \fr 11:2-3 \fk forty two months and 1,260 days \ft Forty two months is the same as 1,260 days, and it's also the same as three and a half years (Rev. 12:14). The same length of time is also used by Daniel (Dan. 7:25, 12:7). It's good for us to understand that the meaning is a time that has been determined by God, in which the authority of the powers of darkness will be permitted to be victorious over the people of God before the end of the world. In this way, God's Spirit shows that we aren't given precise information about how long this situation will continue.\f* And to show their grief for the evil of mankind, they'll often wear mourning clothes every day.
\v 4 Those two witnesses are the ones illustrated in the writing of the Prophet Zachariah— who are the two olive trees and the two large lamps that stand before the Lord, the High King over all the earth.\x + Zach. 4:1-14\x*
\v 5 If anyone wants to persecute those two witnesses, then fire will come out of both of their mouths and burn the people who persecute them. That's how God has determined to give the death penalty to all those who want to persecute those two.
\v 6 They're also given authority to close the sky so that rain can't fall as long as they're prophesying. And they have authority to change water to blood. They're also allowed to punish people on earth by all kinds of disasters. They can cause any disaster whenever they want to.
\p
\v 7 But when the two witnesses have finished the task which was planned by God for them, a wild beast\x + Rev. 13:7, 11; Dan. 7:21\x* will appear from the pit of death and will attack them. Then God will allow that beast to defeat and kill them.
\v 8 Their bodies will be left in the place they're killed on the main street of the big city— that is the city where the Lord of those two witnesses was crucified. The evil of that city can be illustrated by Sodom. And spiritually, the residents of that city are like the residents of Egypt.
\v 9-10 Then people from every country, people group, tribe and language will be happy and party while sending each other gifts because of the death of those two prophets who caused so much suffering for the residents of the earth. Because of that, for three and a half days they won't allow the bodies of the two to be buried.
\p
\v 11 But after three and a half days, God will give the breath of life to the two witnesses. Then they'll come back to life, and everyone who sees that miracle will be frightened.
\v 12 Then the two witnesses will hear a voice from heaven which cries out, “Come up here!” So clouds will cover the two of them, and they'll be lifted up to heaven. At that time, the people who opposed them will still be there and witness that event.
\p
\v 13 Then at that time, there'll be a terrible earthquake. That earthquake will destroy a tenth of the city of Jerusalem and seven thousand people will be killed. Everyone who doesn't die will be very frightened and will say to each other, “God who rules from heaven is definitely very strong!”
\p
\v 14 That's the second disaster that was announced by that eagle.\x + Rev. 8:13\x* But after that, the third disaster will soon follow.
\s The seventh trumpet
\p
\v 15 When the seventh angel blew his trumpet, many voices were heard from heaven which cried out,
\q1 “From now on and forever
\q2 God will rule the whole earth in reality.
\q1 And Christ— who was appointed by God, will rule as King with Him!
\m
\v 16 Then the twenty-four leaders who were previously sitting on their own thrones around the throne of God immediately fell headlong and worshiped God
\v 17 while singing,
\q1 “We thank you, oh Lord—
\q2 God Almighty, and the God who always is, both now and from the beginning of time!
\q1 For through Your great authority You've defeated all of Your enemies
\q2 and have begun to rule in reality.
\q1
\v 18 Of course ‘all people groups were angry and made plans to oppose You’,\x + Ps. 2\x*
\q2 but now the time has come to punish them according to Your anger.
\q1 The Judgment Day has come for all dead people.
\q2 So this is the time when You give rewards to all of Your servants—
\q2 that is to all who fear and respect You, both those of high and low position.
\q1 All of Your people who've been purified through Christ will be given a reward,
\q2 and especially all your messengers who prophesy.
\q1 But this is also the time to destroy everyone who has ruined and defiled the earth.”
\p
\v 19 Then the Most Holy Room in heaven was opened and the Ark of the Covenant was seen inside— which is a heavenly chest that's a reminder of the promise God made with His people.\x + Heb. 8-9:4; Ex. 25:10-22; 1 Kings 8:1-9\x* Then there was lightning, thunder and the sound of very loud rumblng, earthquakes, and very large hail on earth.
