\c 9
\p
\v 1 When the fifth angel blew his trumpet, I saw a star which had already fallen from the sky to earth. But the star was like an angel, and he was given a key that could open the hole of the pit of death.
\v 2 So he opened the door of the hole of the pit of death, and smoke rose from that hole like the smoke from a huge fireplace. The sun and sky became dark because of the smoke from that hole.
\p
\v 3 Then grasshoppers came out of the smoke onto the earth in very great numbers. And God gave authority to the grasshoppers to hurt mankind with their poison— like the poison of scorpions.
\v 4 They were forbidden to ruin the grass, plants, or trees on earth. They could only hurt humans who didn't have the stamp of God on their foreheads.\x + Rev. 7:1-8\x*
\v 5 The grasshoppers weren't permitted to kill the portion of people I mentioned, but only to torture them for as long as five months— which is torture that feels like the pain from the bite of a poisonous scorpion.
\v 6 For those five months, people will want to die, and search for a way out by killing themselves. But God will make death stay far away from them, so that their efforts to kill themselves will fail.
\p
\v 7 The grasshoppers looked like horses wearing battle equipment made from iron plates. On top of their heads was something like gold crowns. The faces of the grasshoppers were like human faces,
\v 8 with long hair like a woman. But their teeth were sharp like a lion's teeth.
\v 9 Their chests were covered with metal coats. The sound of their wings was like the sound of a great many carts pulled by horses running quickly to attack the enemy.
\v 10 The tails of those grasshoppers contain poison like the poison of a scorpion sting. The tails of the grasshoppers were used to torture humans for five months.
\v 11 The king who ruled the troops of grasshoppers was the ruler of the pit of death. In the Hebrew language his name is Abaddon, and in the Greek language Apollyon. Both of those names mean 'destroyer'.
\p
\v 12 That's the first disaster that was announced by the eagle previously mentioned.\x + Rev. 8:13\x* But there are still two more disasters that have to happen.
\p
\v 13 When the sixth angel blew his trumpet, I heard a voice come out from the golden altar that was in front of God. The altar was square-shaped and at every corner there was a horn, and the voice came out from one of those horns.
\v 14 The voice ordered the sixth angel who had just blown his trumpet, “Release the four demons that are tied near the great Euphrates river!”\f + \fr 9:14 \fk demons … \ft Literally, 'angels/messengers'. It's not likely that these four angels are those who still serve God because they are bound. It's possible that they're angels who joined the devil in rebelling against God before the creation of the world. It's also possible that these four demons are the leaders of the devil's army which is pictured in 16-19.\f*
\v 15 That command was carried out precisely according to the time determined by God— the year, month, day and even the hour. So the demons were released to carry out their tasks— which was to kill one third of the people on earth.
\v 16 And I was told the total number of soldiers on horses that were led by the demons was two hundred million.
\p
\v 17 In my vision, I was able to see those soldiers on horses. They wore coats of metal. Some of their coats of metal were the color red like flames of fire, and some were the color dark blue, and some others wore the color yellow like sulfur. The heads of the horses were like heads of lions. And the horses also had power to shoot out fire, black smoke, and sulfurous smoke from their mouths.
\v 18 Then one third of the people on earth were killed by the disaster that came out of the mouths of those horses— that is fire, smoke and sulfur.
\v 19 The power of those horses to kill wasn't just because of what came out of their mouths, but also because their tails were like heads of snakes that could bite and torture people.
\p
\v 20 But the other people, who weren't killed by that great disaster still didn't want to repent of their idol worship. They refused to stop worshiping evil spirits and idols made with their own hands. They kept praising their idols which were made of gold, silver, bronze, stone, and wood— which are things that can't see, hear, or walk.
\v 21 And they also didn't repent of doing their other evil deeds— including murder, sorcery, immorality, and theft.
