\s Jesus' letter to the church in Ephesus
\p
\v 1 Then Jesus said to me,
\pi “Write these things to the Lord's servant\f + \fr 2:1 \fk Lord's servant \ft See note in Rev. 1:20.\f* who represents the Lord's church in the city of Ephesus: This is the message from Me, who holds the seven stars in My right hand and who watches over the condition of the seven golden lamps:
\pi
\v 2 “I know how each of you lives, and I notice that you keep fighting for Me and endure with patience. I'm glad that you drove the people who are involved in misleading teachings out of your church. And when false teachers appeared and claimed that they're apostles whom I've sent, you tested them, and finally realized that they're liars.
\v 3 I know that you continue to stand firm as My followers. And when you were persecuted for that, you kept enduring and didn't give up.
\pi
\v 4 “But I'm disappointed in you because of this: You don't love Me anymore, and don't love each other anymore, like when you first believed in Me.
\v 5 Wake up! You've already gone too far away from Me. Therefore repent! And come back to your first way of life. But if you don't repent, I will come and remove your golden lamp from its place in front of Me.\f + \fr 2:5 \fk remove your golden lamp… \ft In agreement with Rev. 1:20, the golden lamp illustrates the church. So if the golden lamp is removed from in front of Jesus, it means they've received a harsh punishment so that there's no longer a church in that city.\f*
\v 6 But I'm happy with you because of this: You hate the lifestyle taught by the followers of Nicholas.\f + \fr 2:6 \fk the followers of Nicholas \ft It isn't known for certain what was taught by Nicholas' group. But in this book it is clear that Nicholas was a false teacher who taught that Christians could commit adultery and be involved in feasts for idols. (Rev. 2:14-15, 2:20, 2:24) Most likely this misleading teaching came from the false teaching called Gnosticism, because they taught that what the body did wouldn't stain one's spiritual life. For that reason they felt free to commit any sin whatever.\f* I also hate that wicked lifestyle.
\pi
\v 7 “You have ears— don't you?! So listen closely to this news that My Spirit gives to the seven churches!
\pi “This is the reward which will be given to each of you who wins in this spiritual battle: I will give you the right to eat the fruit from the tree of life which is in God's Garden.”\f + \fr 2:7 \fk God's Garden \ft The place of that garden is in heaven— which is also called the New Jerusalem. See Rev. 22:1-2.\f*
\s Jesus' letter to the church of Smyrna
\pi
\v 8 “Write this to the Lord's servant who represents the church in the city of Smyrna: This is the message from Me, who always exists— both before the beginning of creation and after all of creation passes away. Also, I've died but came back to life.
\pi
\v 9 “I know that you suffer persecution and are also poor, but you're actually rich! And I also know that you were accused of doing evil things by those who call themselves Jews. But they aren't actually Jews, but the church of the devil.
\v 10 Don't be afraid of the suffering which you'll soon experience. For the devil will influence people to oppose you so that some of your brothers and sisters will be arrested and imprisoned. Of course the devil does that to test your faithfulness to Me. And you'll experience severe suffering for ten days.\f + \fr 2:10 \fk ten days \ft Like other numbers in the book of Revelation, it's quite likely that the total number of days isn't meant to be interpreted literally. Most likely 'ten days' means 'for a short time'.\f* Remain faithful— even if you have to die! Then I will give you a crown of victory\f + \fr 2:10 \fk crown of victory \ft The word translated ‘crown’ here doesn't mean a king's crown made of gold, but a wreath of an olive branch— like the sign of victory in athletic competitions of that time. Commentators have different opinions as to whether ‘crown’ here is only an analogy that points to the gift of eternal life, or if God's people will actually receive crowns when entering heaven. See also Jas. 1:12; 2Tim. 4:8; 1Ptr. 5:4; Rev. 2:10.\f* when you enter heaven to live forever.
\pi
\v 11 “You have ears— don't you?! So listen closely to this news that My Spirit gives to the seven churches!
\pi “This is the reward which will be given to each of you who wins in this spiritual battle: You won't experience the second stage of death.”
\s Jesus' letter to the church of Pergamum
\pi
\v 12 “Write this to the Lord's servant who represents the church in Pergamum: This is the message from Me, who's ready to fight with the full power of My words— that are like a sword which has two sharp edges.
\pi
\v 13 “I know that your city is the center of evil, so it can be said that the devil has his throne there. Even so, each of you remains faithful to Me. In fact, you didn't deny that you're My followers when My faithful witness— Antipas, was killed in your city, which is like the capitol city of the devil's kingdom.
\pi
\v 14 “But I'm disappointed with you because of this: Some of you follow the misleading teaching which was taught by Balaam. Remember how Balaam taught Balak to persuade the people of Israel to commit sin— which was by taking part in the feast to honor idols and by committing immorality.\x + Num. 22-25:3, 31:16\x*
\v 15 The people among you who follow the teaching of Nicholas are almost the same as the misleading teaching of Balaam.
\v 16 So repent! If you don't, I will suddenly come to you and attack whoever follows that misleading teaching with the full power of My words. The power of My words is illustrated by a sharp two-edged sword.
\pi
\v 17 “You have ears— don't you?! So listen closely to this news that My Spirit gives to the seven churches!
\pi “This is the reward that will be given to each of you who wins in this spiritual battle: I will give you the reward to eat part of the hidden manna.\f + \fr 2:17 \fk hidden manna \ft When the twelve tribes of Israel went out of Egypt and lived in the desert for forty years, God gave food from heaven to them every morning. That food was named 'manna'. God ordered Moses to save a bottle of manna in the Ark of the Covenant. But over time, that bottle of manna disappeared from the Ark of the Covenant, (1 Kings 8:9; 2 Chr. 5:10), and what happened to that bottle isn't written in the history of Israel. But there's a legend which arose in which they say at some later time, God will reveal that bottle and the manna to them. For us now, hidden manna shows that we truly are the people of God, and in heaven we won't ever be hungry again.\f* And I will give you a white stone, and a new name will be written on that stone, which I will give you in a special way— which won't be known by anyone except you alone.”
\s Jesus' letter to the church in Thyatira
\pi
\v 18 “Write this to the Lord's servant who represents the church in Thyatira: This is the message from Me— the Son of God. I'm the one who has eyes that shine like flames of fire, and My feet gleam like brass shines when it's being purified in an extremely hot fire.
\pi
\v 19 “I know how each of you lives, and I know how you keep loving your fellow brothers and sisters in the faith. I know that you remain certain of Me and faithful to Me, keep serving Me, and keep enduring in suffering. In fact, in all of these things you've progressed more, and experienced a higher level than your first way of life when you had just believed in Me.
\pi
\v 20 “But I'm disappointed in you because of this: You keep allowing that woman named Jezebel to lead My people astray. She claims she's a prophet, but by her teaching she urges My people to commit immorality and take part in feasts to honor idols.
\v 21 I've given her many opportunities to repent, but she doesn't want to repent of her immorality.
\v 22 So I will punish her with an awful illness, so that she's forced to lie and suffer on the bed where she likes to commit adultery. And all of the men who've committed adultery with her will also be punished in the same way, if they don't repent of the evil deeds which are taught by that Jezebel.
\v 23 I will even kill some of her followers. In that way, all of the churches will know that I'm the only one who knows what's in people's hearts and thoughts. And I'm He who will repay you according to your own deeds.
\pi
\v 24 “But for you in Thyatira who don't follow her teaching— that is you who reject learning what they call 'the devil's advanced teachings', I'm telling you this: I won't place any other burden on you.
\v 25 Just keep enduring in your faith in Me until I return.
\pi
\v 26-28 “This is the reward which will be given to each of you who keeps on obeying Me until the last day, and wins in this spiritual battle: Just like I received authority from My Father, I will give that authority to you, too— which is the 'authority to rule over all people groups'. And along with Me, you'll 'give them a harsh punishment for their wrongs and evil'. Your authority to punish is illustrated by a 'rod of iron which easily destroys ceramic pots'.\x + Ps. 2:7-9; Rev. 12:5, 19:15\x* And I will also give you shining glory like the morning star which shines in the east.\x + Dan. 12:3; Rev. 22:16\x*
\pi
\v 29 “You have ears— don't you?! So listen closely to this news that My Spirit gives to the seven churches!”
