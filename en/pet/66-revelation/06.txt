\c 6
\s The Lamb releases six of the seals
\p
\v 1 Then I saw Him, who's called the Lamb, release the first seal of the seven seals that were on the scroll. Right after, that I heard one of the four living creatures say with a voice like the sound of thunder, “Come!”
\v 2 And I was surprised to see a white horse move forward in front of them all, and the person riding on it held a bow. A crown was given to him, and then he left for earth to defeat his enemies.
\v 3 When the Lamb released the second seal, then I heard the second creature say, “Come!”
\v 4 Then another horse came forward. That horse was red like a flame of fire. The rider of that horse was given authority to do away with peace on the earth, so that mankind would kill each other, and he was given a large sword.
\p
\v 5 And when the Lamb released the third seal, then I heard the third living creature say, “Come!” Then a black horse came forward. The rider of that horse held a scale in his hand.
\v 6 Then I heard a voice that sounded like the voice of a man, which came out from between the four living creatures. The voice said, “Oh dear! The price of one liter of wheat or three liters of the cheap kind of wheat\f + \fr 6:6 \fk cheap kind of wheat \ft Literally, “barley.”\f* have each risen to be the same as the daily wage of a worker! Oh dear, don't let the price of cooking oil and wine go up too!”\f + \fr 6:6 \fk Quotation \ft This quotation in a human voice illustrates that this messenger of God's brings punishment in the form of a ruined economy and food market, resulting in famine and suffering. The measurement which is literally 'koiniks', is almost the same measurement as a liter. The meaning of the last sentence is unclear, so there are many interpretations. Those words can also be translated, “Don't ruin the olive trees and grapevines,” or “Don't create a shortage of oil and wine.”\f*
\p
\v 7 When the Lamb opened the fourth seal, then the fourth living creature said, “Come!”
\v 8 And a pale horse came forward. It's rider illustrates death, and there was a person who looked like a ghost who followed him— which illustrates the kingdom of death. They were given authority over one fourth of the earth— that is authority to kill the people on earth through war, famine, disease, and by wild animal attacks.
\p
\v 9 When the Lamb released the fifth seal, then I saw many souls under the altar of heaven! The souls were those who had been killed for faithfully telling God's Word.
\v 10 They were crying out, “Oh Lord who's holy and righteous, when is it time for You to judge and punish the people of the world who killed us?”
\v 11 Then each of those souls was given a white robe, and they were told to be patient a little longer, because there are still more of their brothers and sisters in the faith who will be killed like them— that is those who are following their example in the service of Christ. They should wait patiently until the total number of people to be killed has been reached— according to the plan of God.
\p
\v 12 When the Lamb released the sixth seal, a huge earthquake happened, and the sun became black like mourning clothes, and the full moon became red like blood.
\v 13 The stars in the sky fell onto the earth— like the unripe fruit of a fig tree fall to the ground when shaken by a strong wind.
\v 14 Then the sky split apart and rolled up— like a sheet of paper is rolled up, and every mountain and island was moved from it's place.
\p
\v 15 Then everyone— including the kings of the earth, leading people, the military commanders, rich people, strong people and other people, both slaves and free, ran away and hid in caves and gaps in the rocks of the mountains.
\v 16 Then they said to the mountains and rocks, “Collapse and fall on top of us quickly! Hide us from Him who sits on the throne and from the anger of Him who's called the Lamb!
\v 17 For that most terrifying day has come— when God and the Lamb will punish us by pouring out Their anger! After that, there certainly won't be any of us still alive!”
