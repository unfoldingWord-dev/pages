\s The Lamb who is worthy to open the scroll of God's plans
\v 1 Then I saw a scroll in the right hand of Him who sat on the throne. The scroll had writing on the inside and outside, but it couldn't be opened and read because it was closed with seven seals that were made of wax.
\v 2 And I saw a very strong angel ask with a loud voice, “Who's worthy to release the seals of the scroll and open it?”
\v 3 But obviously, there wasn't anyone— either in heaven, or on earth, or under the earth, who was worthy to open it or look inside of it.
\v 4 So I cried with great sadness, because there wasn't anyone who was worthy to do that.
\v 5 But one of the twenty-four leaders said to me, “Don't cry! He who's like a lion of the tribe of Judah has won! He's the High King descended from David.\f + \fr 5:5 \fk High King descended from David \ft Literally, 'David's root/sprout'— which is one expression that means the Messiah who was promised, who would come from the descendants of King David. See Is. 29:18-19, 35:4-6, 42:6-7. Also see Mark 10:47 with its footnote.\f* He's the one who's worthy to release the seven seals of the scroll and open it!”
\p
\v 6 Then I saw a Lamb standing near the great throne, and surrounded by the four living creatures and the leaders. But the Lamb looked like it had been killed. He also had seven horns— which illustrate His divine authority to rule, and seven eyes— which illustrate all the power of God's Spirit, which was sent into the whole world.
\v 7 The Lamb came and took the scroll from the right hand of the Almighty, who sat on the throne.
\v 8 And when He had taken that scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four leaders immediately fell down headlong and worshiped before Him. They each held their own harps, and they also held golden bowls which were full of incense— which illustrate the prayers of God's people.
\v 9 And they sang a new song to Him,
\q1 “You are worthy to receive the scroll
\q2 and release it's seals!
\q1 For You were killed,
\q2 and with Your own blood You've bought them back for God,
\q2 from every tribe, language, people group and country.
\q1
\v 10 You've also made them citizens of God's kingdom
\q2 and priests who serve our God.
\q2 And You made them kings who will rule over the whole earth.”
\p
\v 11 Then in that vision I heard the voices of countless angels— thousands of thousands, in fact millions of millions. The angels surrounded the leaders, the leaders surrounded the four living creatures, and the four living creatures surrounded the great throne.
\v 12 They sang in a loud voice,
\q1 “Let all authority, wealth, wisdom and power
\q2 be the possession of the Lamb who was killed!
\q2 He's the one who's worthy to receive all honor, glory, and praise!”
\p
\v 13 Then I heard every living creature that was in heaven, on the earth, under the earth, and in the sea— everyone that was in every place cry out,
\q1 “All praise, honor, glory, and authority
\q2 forever and ever
\q1 be to Him who sits on the throne
\q2 and to the Lamb!”
\m
\v 14 Then the four living creatures cried out, “Amen!” And the leaders immediately fell down headlong and worshiped Him.
