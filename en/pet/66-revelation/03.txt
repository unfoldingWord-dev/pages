\s Jesus' letter to the church in Sardis
\pi
\v 1 “Write this to the Lord's servant who represents the church in Sardis: This is the message from Me, who has all of the power of God's Spirit,\f + \fr 3:1 \fk all of the power of God's Spirit \ft Literally, 'the seven Spirits of God'. In the Holy Bible, especially in the Revelation of John, the number seven has a symbolic meaning. John used the number seven to show things that are complete, perfect, or godly. This is why God's Spirit— which is one, of course, can be illustrated as seven. (Compare Rev. 1:5, 3:1, 4:5 and 5:6.) There are also commentators who say that John thought about Is. 11:2-5— where Isaiah prophesied about the seven characteristics of the Holy Spirit which are seen in Christ Himself.\f* and who holds the seven stars which illustrate the seven churches.
\pi “I know how each of you lives. You are known as My faithful and zealous followers, but spiritually speaking you're actually almost dead.
\v 2 For that reason wake up, and rise up from your death! And strengthen your spiritual lives which are almost dead so they live again! For I know— before God, none of your works have been totally completed.
\v 3 For that reason, remember the teaching which you've heard and believed from the beginning. Obey it and repent! If you resist guarding your spirits so that they live again, then I will come suddenly and punish you. And you won't know beforehand the moment that I will come, because I will come like a thief.
\pi
\v 4 “But there are just a few people in the church in Sardis who haven't stained yourselves by doing evil.\f + \fr 3:4 \fk haven't stained yourselves … \ft Secara harfiah, “Haven't stained your robes.” In the whole book of Revelation, clean or white robes illustrate holiness in one's life style.\f* Each of you will walk with Me in white clothing, because you deserve to receive that honor.
\pi
\v 5 “This is the reward which will be given to each of you who wins in this spiritual battle: White clothing will be given to you. And I won't erase your names from the Book of Life. But before My Father, and before the angels, I will state that you've proven faithful to Me.
\pi
\v 6 “You have ears— don't you?! So listen closely to this news that My Spirit gives to the seven churches!”
\s Jesus' letter to the church in Philadelphia
\pi
\v 7 “Write this to the Lord's servant who represents the church in Philadelphia: This is the message from Me— who's called “The Holy One” and who's very worthy to be believed. I hold the “keys of David,”\x + Is. 22:22\x* so I have the right to determine who'll receive the right to become citizens of God's kingdom. If I open the door for a person, no one can hinder him by closing that door. And if I close the door for a person, no one can open the door for him.
\pi
\v 8 “I know the way of life of each of you. I know that your strength to endure is very limited, yet you still follow My teachings and don't deny that you're My followers. Because of that, look! I've opened the door— that is an opportunity for you, so that you'll tell about Me, and no one can close that door of opportunity.
\v 9 Listen! I will make the people who are opposing you now come and kneel before you, and repent. They're the ones who claim they're followers of the Jewish religion, but they're actually the church of the devil. But I will make them realize that I love you.
\v 10 You've obeyed My command to endure with patience as My followers. For that reason, I will protect you from the time of trouble that will be poured out on the whole earth to test all mankind who live on the earth.
\pi
\v 11 “I will come soon! Keep enduring in your faith in Me until I come, so that in this contest to defend your faith, no one will be able to steal your crown of victory when you're so close to the finish line!
\pi
\v 12 “This is the reward which will be given to each of you who wins in this spiritual battle: I will make you like a large pillar in the Temple of My God. By that I mean you have the right to live there forever. And on your body I will write the name of My God, and the name of the city of My God— which is the new Jerusalem that will come down from heaven. I will also write My new name on you.\f + \fr 3:12 \fk ayat 12 \ft The names written on the bodies of the victors show that they've become God's and Christ's possessions forever, and that they're citizens of the kingdom of heaven.\f*
\pi
\v 13 “You have ears— don't you?! So listen closely to this news that My Spirit gives to the seven churches!”
\s Jesus' letter to the church in Laodicea
\pi
\v 14 “Write this to the Lord's servant who represents the church in Laodicea: This is the message from Me, who's also called The Amen!\f + \fr 3:14 \fk Amen \ft Amen means “really agree,” or 'may it happen'. Here Jesus uses the word Amen as another name for Himself, and the meaning of that name is explained in the next sentence. Compare to 2 Cor. 1:20.\f* I mean that I'm the Witness who's very worthy to be believed— who has taught what's true about My Father. Through Me, My Father created everything.
\pi
\v 15 “I know the way of life of each of you— that spiritually you're neither cold or hot. May you become hot or cold, and not just half-heartedly follow Me!
\v 16 So you can be illustrated by food that's just lukewarm— neither cold nor hot. I mean that you're like food which I spit it out of My mouth as soon as I've tasted it !
\v 17 For each one of you thinks, 'I'm already rich. The wealth that I've gathered is enough so that I won't experience the lack of anything anymore.' But you don't realize that spiritually you're very poor, without hope, destitute, blind, and naked.
\v 18 So I advise you to trade your riches for My gold— that is gold which has been purified in fire, so that you'll really be rich.\x + Luke 16:9\x* And use your wealth to buy white clothing from Me, so that later on you won't be naked and ashamed anymore. And buy oil to rub on your eyes, so that the eyes of your heart can see clearly.
\pi
\v 19 “My beloved children, I'm the One who rebukes you and corrects you!\x + Heb. 12:5-11\x* For that reason, relight the fire of your enthusiasm again and repent!
\v 20 Look! It's as if I'm standing in front of the door of each of your homes, knocking, and asking permission to enter. Whoever hears My voice and opens the door of his heart for Me, I will enter it. Then we'll often eat together as close friends.
\pi
\v 21 “This is the reward which will be given to each of you who wins in this spiritual battle: I will give you authority to rule with Me. And you'll sit on thrones to the right and left of My throne— just like I sat to the right of My Father's throne after I won the great spiritual battle.\x + Matt. 19:28; 1 Cor. 6:2\x*
\pi
\v 22 “You have ears— don't you?! So listen closely to this news that My Spirit gives to the seven churches!”
