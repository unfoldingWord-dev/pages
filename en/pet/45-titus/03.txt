\s The right way to live
\p
\v 1 Brother, please remind all the followers of Christ to always respect all of the leaders of government, obey them, and always be ready to do good.
\v 2 Tell them not to slander other people, but to live in peace with everyone. They must also be gentle and polite to everyone.
\p
\v 3 For at first, we were also stupid people who didn't obey God. We were misled and bound by all kinds of desires which only pleased our bodies. And we always had evil plans, and were jealous. People hated us, and we hated them.
\q1
\v 4 However, while we were in that condition, God, who's also our Savior,
\q2 showed His kindness and love to all of us by opening the way of salvation to us.
\q1
\v 5 We aren't saved because of our good deeds,
\q2 but because He Himself has compassion on us.
\q1 He saves us through His Spirit
\q2 who cleanses us from sin,
\q2 so that we're born again and have new life.
\q1
\v 6 And He pours out His Spirit on us completely
\q2 through Christ Jesus, our Savior.
\q1
\v 7 It's just through the kindness of God alone that
\q2 we've become right in His eyes!
\q1 The purpose of all of this is that we become children of God
\q2 who have the right to receive eternal life.
\q2 This is what we look forward to by faith.
\m
\v 8 All that I've said is true. And Brother, I want you to teach all that with emphasis, so that people who believe in God sincerely try to do good. This way of life is proper for us followers of Christ, and is also useful for everyone.
\p
\v 9 But don't get involved if there are those who argue about Jewish teachings, for example if they argue about the names of their forefathers, and also about the Law. Arguments about things like that aren't useful and are unwise.
\v 10 So if there's someone who causes division because he likes to argue, you must rebuke him up to two times so that he stops. If he keeps causing trouble, don't have anything to do with him any more.
\v 11 For you know that people like that are sinful and don't follow the true teaching. Their sins prove that they're wrong.
\s Final instructions and greetings
\p
\v 12 I will send Artemas or Tychicus to you. When one of them arrives, please come to me in Nicopolis quickly, Brother. I've decided to stay there for the winter.
\p
\v 13 When Apollos and Zenas, the lawyer, are ready to leave there, I ask the church to help them as much as possible, so that they can continue their journey without lacking anything.
\v 14 It's best for us, as followers of Christ, to learn to help each other like that, and always be ready to do good when another person needs help. Let's not live carelessly.
\p
\v 15 Everyone who's here with me sends you greetings. Give our greetings to the people who love us because we believe in Jesus.
\p I pray that God will always be kind to all of you.\f + \fr 3:15 \fk all of you \ft From the last two words, it's clear that Paul knows that it won't be just Titus who reads this letter.\f*
