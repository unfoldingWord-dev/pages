\v 1-4 Dear Titus, my brother in the faith— who's truly my spiritual son, because we have the same faith:
\p Greetings from Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Christ Jesus. I've been sent to help God’s people so that they believe in Christ more and more, and know the true teaching. And that true teaching guides us so that we live according to the will of God. Because we believe and follow that true teaching, we're certain that we have eternal life. God, who never lies, had promised that life to us before the world was created. Then at the proper time, God, who's also our Savior, revealed that life to the world through the Good News, and I've been entrusted with the task of spreading that news of salvation.
\p I pray that God the Father, and our Savior Christ Jesus, will always be kind to you and watch over you so that you live calm under God’s protection!
\s Titus’ work on Crete
\p
\v 5 I left you on the island of Crete so that you can finish the work that still needs to be done, and can appoint some people in each city to become elders.
\v 6 To be chosen to become an elder, that person must live blamelessly. He must be faithful to his wife, and may not have more than one wife. His children must also be believers. They must not be known as children who can't be managed or who are disobedient.
\v 7 An elder has the task of managing God’s work. For that reason, he can only be appointed if his life is blameless. He must not be arrogant, hard-headed, or easily angered, or a drunkard. Don't appoint a person who likes to fight, or tries to become rich by cheating others.
\v 8 An elder must also be ready to help other people by receiving them into his house. He must always want what's best for everyone. He must be wise and live right, and he must be faithful to God, and be pleasing to Him.
\v 9 An elder must be faithful to follow all that we teach, so that he can help people with the true teaching.\f + \fr 1:9 \fk true teaching \ft Literally, “teaching that's healthy.” Healthy teaching is teaching that has proven to produce good things when it's followed. That kind of teaching leads to living in a way that brings honor to Christ, and also gives spiritual blessings. See also Tit. 1:13, 2:1, and 1 Tim 1:5.\f* For in that way, he can show people who oppose that teaching that they're wrong.
\p
\v 10 That's important, because there're many people who don't want to obey, and who mislead other people. I especially mean those who say that all men must be circumcised.
\v 11 We must stop them so that they don't teach any more, because their teaching causes the faith of many believing families to be confused— both parents and children. And they also use that false teaching as a reason to ask for money.
\v 12 In the past, there was a well-known person, who also came from Crete, who wrote,
\b
\q1 “All the residents of the island of Crete are liars.\f + \fr 1:12 \fk liars \ft The people of Crete were well-known as liars. There's a legend of their's wherein a prominent Cretan person died, then became God. So they said that “God is Cretan.”\f*
\q2 They're like evil beasts,
\q1 lazy to work,
\q2 and only want to eat.”
\m
\v 13 What that famous person said is really true! So rebuke them harshly, so that they keep believing the true teaching.
\v 14 In that way they won't care about tales of the Jewish people, and they'll stop following the commands of the people who've left the true teaching.
\p
\v 15 To people whose hearts are pure, all foods and objects are pure. But for those who are full of sin and don't believe, nothing is pure. Their thinking has truly become evil, and their consciences are already dirty.
\v 16 They say that they know God, but their actions don't prove it. They refuse to obey God, and aren't able to do anything good. God hates their way of life.
