\s Obey the true teaching
\p
\v 1 However Titus, you must always teach the way of life which is according to the true teaching.
\v 2 Teach the older men to control themselves, to live wisely and as people who can be respected. They must continue to believe the true teaching, sincerely love others, and always endure when facing trouble.
\v 3 Advise the older women also, to live just to please God. They must not tell false stories about other people, and must not be unable to keep away from alcoholic drinks. They must teach only good things too.
\v 4 In that way, they can teach the young women to love their husbands and children.
\v 5 They can also teach the young women to live wisely and with pure hearts. It's best for young women to learn how to manage their households well, and how to serve their husbands too. That way, no one can criticize the teaching that God gave us.
\p
\v 6 In the same way, teach the young men to live wisely.
\v 7 Titus, you must become a good example to them in everything. Teach them with an honest heart, in a way that's worthy to be respected.
\v 8 And all your teaching has to be right, so that it doesn't give an opportunity to those who oppose us. In that way, they'll be ashamed because they can't find any fault that can be used to criticize us.
\p
\v 9 And tell the people who work as slaves owned by other people these things: They must always be ready to serve their own masters, must try to please them, and may not argue with their masters.
\v 10 They must not steal their master's belongings. But they must prove that they can truly be trusted in everything. In that way, everyone will be pleased with our teaching about how God saves people.
\p
\v 11 That's the way we should live, because God has now shown His kindness, which is able to save everyone.
\v 12 So, as long as we live in this world, the kindness of God works in our hearts so that we learn to live wisely, honestly, serving God, and freeing ourselves from worldly desires which always oppose the Lord’s will.
\v 13 So now, with joy and great faith\f + \fr 2:13 \fk with joy and great faith \ft These words translate what is literally “the hope which is full of blessing.”\f* we wait for the day our Savior Christ Jesus returns. At that time, the radiance of the glory of Jesus as the all-powerful God will be seen in this world.\f + \fr 2:13 \fk glory of Jesus as God \ft The Greek can be understood as, “… wait for the time when the almighty God and our Savior Jesus will return— when the glory of God and Jesus will be revealed.” For other verses where Jesus is spoken of as God, see John 10:30; Rom. 9:5; Php. 2:6; 1John 5:20.\f*
\v 14 He surrendered Himself to be killed so that we would be purified and set free from all evil, to become His special people and are always diligent to do good.
\p
\v 15 These are the things you must tell them. Urge them to follow these things. And if they don't obey, rebuke them. You have full authority to do that, so don't let anyone think that they can ignore you.
