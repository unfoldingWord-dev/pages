\c 15
\p
\v 1 As for us who are mature in our convictions about our freedom in oneness with Christ, we must be patient and help members who still have doubts about things like that. So we may not just please ourselves.
\v 2 Instead, let's try to live in a way to please each other, so that we help and encourage each other.
\v 3 For when Christ lived in this world, He didn't live just to please Himself either. But what was written in the Holy Bible was fulfilled by Him— like when the writer complained to God, “Oh God, when people insult You, it's as if they insult me.”\x + Ps. 69:10.\x*
\v 4 Everything that's written in the Holy Bible is a lesson for us. And all of those lessons are given to make us firm and strong, so that we keep hoping in God as our Helper.
\v 5 He's the source of patience and strength for us. And I pray that God helps you all to live in harmony— as Christ Jesus desires,
\v 6 so that you'll all be united and of one heart. In that way, you can with one heart and mind praise and glorify God— who's the Father of our Lord Christ Jesus.
\p
\v 7 Because Christ has accepted you as His people, you should also accept each other as your fellow brothers and sisters in the faith, so that God is glorified.
\v 8 I speak like that because Christ became a servant for the Jewish people to show that God fulfills all of His promises to them. And Christ proved that all of God's promises to the Jewish forefathers are true.
\v 9 Christ also did that so that non-Jewish people groups will also take part in glorifying God because of His kindness which He revealed to them. It's like what a person said to God in the Holy Bible,
\q1 “For that reason I will give thanks to You among the people groups that aren't Jewish,
\q2 and I will sing praise songs to Your name.”\x + Ps. 18:50\x*
\m
\v 10 And it's also written,
\q1 “You people groups that aren't Jews,
\q2 rejoice with God's people.”\x + Deut. 32:43\x*
\m
\v 11 It's also written,
\q1 “All of you people groups that aren't Jewish, praise the Lord!
\q2 Let every people group praise the Lord.”\x + Ps. 117:1\x*
\m
\v 12 And the Prophet Isaiah prophesied,
\q1 “A Person will come from the descendants of Jesse.
\q2 He'll come forward to rule all the people groups,
\q2 and the people who aren't Jews will hope in Him.”\x + Is. 11:10\x*
\p
\v 13 For that reason I pray for all of you who believe in Christ: I hope that God— the source of our hope, will truly bless you with joy and calmness within His protection. Because of His blessing, and by the power of the Holy Spirit, you'll definitely be more certain of His kindness to us.
\s Paul tells about his work
\p
\v 14 My Brothers and Sisters, I'm sure that you live a very good lifestyle, and I'm also sure that you already have all the knowledge that's necessary in order to advise each other.
\v 15 Even so, I dared to write this letter to firmly remind you about several things— according to the task that God gave me because of His kindness.
\v 16 He's the one who called me to be a servant of Christ Jesus, and He gave me the task to proclaim His Good News to non-Jewish peoples. So I serve like a priest, because I also work as a mediator so that people who aren't Jews can also give their lives to God like a living sacrificial offering. And God will accept them because they've been made pure by His Spirit.
\p
\v 17 For that reason I'm very glad about everything that Christ Jesus does through me for the glory of God.
\v 18 Regarding my ministry, I don't want to brag about myself. But I will only talk about what Christ has done through me, resulting that I have been able to lead non-Jewish people to obey God through what I've said and done.
\v 19 And they became obedient to God because the Holy Spirit showed His power through me so that many miraculous signs happened. And I've told the Good News about Christ completely, beginning in the city of Jerusalem, as far as the region of Illyricum.
\v 20 My desire is to always tell the Good News everywhere, in places where people haven't yet heard about Christ, because I don't want to build the work of my ministry on a foundation that was already built by another person.
\v 21 That's also like what's written in the Holy Bible,
\q1 “People who've not yet accepted the news about Him,
\q2 will see Him.
\q1 And people who've not yet heard the news about Him,
\q2 will understand.”\x + Is. 52:15\x*
\s Paul's plan to visit Rome
\p
\v 22 Because I was always busy in other regions in the past, that was what so often prevented me from visiting you.
\v 23 But now I've finished my work in other regions. And for years now I've wanted to visit you, so I will feel very happy if that happens soon.
\v 24 I plan to visit you before I go to Spain. Yes, I hope to be able to visit you on my way to Spain. After some time, when my longing has been satisfied in fellowship with you, I hope you can help me to continue on my journey.
\p
\v 25 I'm going to Jerusalem now to give help to God's people.
\v 26 Quite a few of God's people in Jerusalem are very poor. And some of the congregations in Macedonia and Achaia have decided to contribute funds to help them.
\v 27 Our brothers and sisters in Macedonia and Achaia were very glad to do it. Of course it's appropriate for them to help the brothers and sisters in the faith in Jerusalem, because they aren't Jews, but have taken part in receiving amazing spiritual blessings from the Jews. So they feel that they're indebted to the Jews and they're sending material blessings.
\v 28 So I'm going to Jerusalem to insure that this help is given to the poor members in Jerusalem. After finishing that task, I'll leave for Spain. But on that trip, I'll visit you first.
\v 29 And when I've arrived in Rome and we've met each other, I'm certain that Christ will really bless us!
\p
\v 30 Brothers and Sisters, I ask for your help to sincerely pray to God about my work. Do that because together we're one with our Lord Christ Jesus, and because of the love that's given to us by the Holy Spirit.
\v 31 Also pray that I will be safe from people who don't believe in Christ in Judea, and that the help I bring to Jerusalem will be pleasing to God's people there.
\v 32 In that way, if God allows, I'll come to you with a joyful heart! And when we meet, we'll have many opportunities to encourage one another.
\v 33 I hope that God— that is He who always protects us so that we live with a feeling of calm, will continue to be with you. Amen.
