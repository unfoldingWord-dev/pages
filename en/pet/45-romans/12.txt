\c 12
\s Give your life to God
\p
\v 1 Because God is so generous to us, it's only proper that we return His kindness! We should all think like this, “Lord, I'm giving my body as a sacrifice to you”— even though we actually keep living! A decision like that is a holy sacrifice, and pleases the Lord.
\v 2 This means that we can't follow a bad lifestyle anymore, which has become the habit of worldly people. But let's surrender our bodies as sacrificial offerings to God, and He'll renew our minds— so that we can know what God's will for us is, and what is best in every situation. By that I mean we can understand and choose what's good and what's most proper for us, along with whatever pleases the Lord.
\p
\v 3 So Brothers and Sisters, because God has been very kind to me so that He chose me as His apostle, I want to give this advice to each of you: Don't consider yourselves to be greater than what's true. Instead, think honestly and humbly about the knowledge and special abilities given to you by the Lord— according to your faith regarding those gifts of the Lord's.\f + \fr 12:3 \fk according to your faith \ft Literally, “according to the measure of faith.”\f*
\v 4-5 For each of us who are one with Christ is a part of the body of Christ. And the body of Christ can be illustrated by the human body. Each of us has one body, but it has many parts, and each part has its own job. It's the same with us: Even though there are many of us, yet each of us is a part of one body— that is the body of Christ. So each of us is connected to the others.
\p
\v 6 So each of us has been given different special abilities— according to God's kindness to each of us. So brother, if you've been given the gift to prophesy, you should give each prophecy according to your faith.
\v 7 If you've been given the gift to serve, you should serve. If you've been given the gift to teach, you should teach.
\v 8 If you've been given the gift to encourage other people, you should encourage other people. Or if you've been given the gift to help other people, you should help them generously. If you've been given the gift to become a leader, you should lead others whole-heartedly. And if you've been given the gift of compassion, you should show compassion to other people with gladness.
\p
\v 9 Let's not just pretend to love other people. But we should love sincerely, and only do what's good, as well as hate every kind of evil.
\v 10 As brothers and sisters in the faith who are already one with Christ, we should love each other with all our hearts. And let's try to honor all of our brothers in the faith more than ourselves.
\v 11 We should be diligent to work and not be lazy! With the strength given by God's Spirit, we should serve the Lord full of enthusiasm.
\v 12 Be joyful, because we can be certain about what we hope for. When facing troubles, we should stand firm. And we should keep praying in every situation!
\v 13 When our brothers and sisters in the faith need help, help them. And if they need a place to stay, the door of your house should be open as a place for them to stay.
\p
\v 14 If someone hurts you, ask God to bless him. Yes, ask for His blessing for him, and don't ask God to curse him!
\v 15 Rejoice with those who are joyful, and cry with those who are crying.
\v 16 We should have one heart and mind. Don't let anyone think that he's more important than other people, but always be ready to associate with ordinary people. And don't think you're so smart.
\p
\v 17 If someone does evil to you, don't repay it with evil again. But think carefully, so that what you want to do to that person is considered to be good by everyone.
\v 18 Try to live in peace with everyone, as much as it's possible on your part.
\v 19 Brothers and Sisters whom I love, don't pay back evil that someone does to you. Let God alone— according to His wrath, be the one to repay the evil that person has done. For it's written in the Lord's Word: “I alone have the right to punish. I will repay everyone who does evil.”\x + Deut. 32:35.\x*
\v 20 But we should do what's in agreement with this verse from the Lord's Word,
\q1 “If the one who opposes you is hungry, give him something to eat;
\q2 if the one who opposes you is thirsty, give him something to drink.
\q1 For in that way
\q2 you'll make him ashamed.”\x + Prov. 25:21-22.\x*
\m
\v 21 Let's not be defeated by evil. But let's defeat evil by continually doing good.
