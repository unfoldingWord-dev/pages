\s Don't consider yourself to be better than other people
\p
\v 1 So my close friends, if you think that you can judge other people, you're wrong. You're also wrong because you're sinful. It's not proper for you to judge your fellowmen, because you also do the same evil things he does. So everytime you judge a person, it's like you're asking God to bring punishment on yourself.
\v 2 We all know that God is just when He brings punishment on a person who isn't honest like that.
\v 3 If you point out the wrongs of someone who does evil, while you yourself do the same evil things he does, do you think that you'll escape God's punishment?
\v 4 However, God is very good and patient with you. God has waited for you to repent, but you don't care about all of His kindness. You must understand that the kindness that He shows you is to lead you to repent.
\p
\v 5 Yet you've hardened your heart and don't want to repent. Don't you know that you're making the punishment for yourself even harsher! On the day God shows His anger, everyone will see that God's punishment on that is just!
\v 6 For God will repay every person according to his deeds.
\v 7 There are people who seek eternal life and are always diligent to do good, who live in a way that brings praise and honor to God. He'll give eternal life to people like that.
\v 8 But there are others who seek honor for themselves. They refuse to follow the true teaching, and like to follow what's evil. He'll punish them with great anger.
\v 9 God will give trouble and suffering to each person who does evil— both to Jews and non-Jews.
\v 10 But everyone who does good will be blessed by Him, so that they're praised, honored, and feel calm— whether Jews or non-Jews,
\v 11 because God doesn't make a distinction between people.
\p
\v 12 So people who already know the Law and break it are just the same as those who've never heard about the law and commit sin. Sinners who don't know the Law will be destroyed. So people who already know the Law and commit sin will also be judged according to the law.
\v 13 For it isn't just the person who hears the Law who's considered right in God's eyes. But the ones who'll turn out to be right before Him are the people who do the rules that are found in the Law.
\v 14 Non-Jews didn't inherit the Law from their predecessors, of course. But it's as if they live according to the Law, so they show that God's rules are already in their hearts.
\v 15 They show that the way of life which God has determined for mankind has been written in their hearts. And every minute their consciences help them to distinguish whether what they're doing is right or wrong.\f + \fk And every … or wrong \ft This sentence can be translated, “And when they discuss people's deeds, they praise the deeds that are right and find fault with people who do evil.”\f*
\v 16 So God will judge everyone according to his or her own conscience. And that will happen at the time He judges each person according to the thoughts that they have been hidden in their hearts. That just judgment will happen through Christ Jesus. That is what I proclaim in the Good News which God has given me.
\s Jews and the rules of the Law
\p
\v 17 But what about you who are Jewish descendants— including myself? We're proud because we're Jewish descendants, and feel that we ourselves are the ones closest to God, because we've inherited the Law.
\v 18 We know what God's will is for us to do, and we can understand what's best in every situation, because we've studied the Law.
\v 19 We think that we deserve to be teachers for people who aren't Jewish, who don't know the true way. And we think that we're like lights that shine on those who are in darkness.
\v 20 We feel that we deserve to be teachers to people who lack wisdom and who've just started to receive true teaching. Because we already have the Law, we think that we control the source of knowledge and the true teaching that's in it.
\v 21 Well, whoever wants to become a teacher, why don't you teach yourself? You forbid other people to steal, yet you still steal yourself.
\v 22 In your teaching, you forbid other people to commit adultery, but you commit adultery yourself. Or you hate the worship of idols, but you yourself steal treasures from idols houses that belong to other people.
\v 23 So even though we're proud because we possess the Law, but through our deeds, we break the law. And because of that, the name of God is often insulted by other people!
\v 24 So it has happened as it's written in the Holy Bible, “Because of the wrongs done by us (Jews), people from other people groups insult God's name.”\x + Is. 52:5; Ezek. 36:20-23.\x*
\p
\v 25 Well, all of us Jews have been circumcised. So if we obey the Law, our circumcision is appropriate and useful. But if we break the Law, it means that we're just like the non-Jews before God and our circumcision really doesn't mean anything!
\v 26 Whereas if people who aren't circumcised obey the demands of the Law, it means that God considers them to be as if they're already circumcised.
\v 27 We Jews should feel ashamed before them! We've been circumcised and possess the written Law, but we still keep breaking the law. Those who fulfill the purpose of the Law, even though they haven't inherited the custom of circumcision from their predecessors, will show that we're wrong.
\p
\v 28 Before God, Jews aren't genuine just because of being born of Jewish descent. And the point of circumcision isn't just that it's a sign made in the body.
\p
\v 29 But a person who deserves to be called a genuine Jew is one who's truly a Jew in his heart. And before God, a person who has truly been circumcised is a person whose heart has been made new by the Holy Spirit. Circumcision of that kind isn't just enough to fulfill the regulation of the written law. People like that receive praise— not from man, but from God.
