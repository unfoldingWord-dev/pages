\c 6
\s United with Christ in His death and resurrection
\p
\v 1 So what should we think about God's kindness to us? Can we keep on committing sin so that God's kindness to us increases more and more?
\v 2 We can't think like that! Spiritually we've already died with Christ. That means that we've been freed from sin's power. We certainly can't keep living in sin like before we knew Christ!
\v 3 Don't forget that we were all united spiritually with the death of Christ Jesus when we were baptized.
\v 4 So at the time we were baptized, it was as if we died and were buried with Christ. And when God used His glorious power to bring Jesus back to life, we were also brought back to a new life.
\p
\v 5 So if we've been united spiritually with Christ in His death, it means that we also take part in being brought back to life, and will live with Him.
\v 6 We know that our old lives were crucified with Christ. That was included in God's plan, so that our bodies are no longer be enslaved by the power of sin.
\v 7 That release happens because we become like dead people— who are no longer tempted and have been freed from the power of sin.
\p
\v 8 If we've died with Christ, it's clear that we'll live with Him.
\v 9 For if Christ was brought back to life from death, He'll definitely never die again. Death has no power over Him anymore.
\v 10 It means that when Christ died once, that was enough to defeat the power of sin forever. Now He has a new life, and because He lives as one with God, it's impossible for Him to die again.
\v 11 It's the same for us too: We consider ourselves dead to sin and one with Christ Jesus so that we live for God alone.
\p
\v 12 So we must not let sin control our bodies any longer. For we only use our bodies for a short time then die. So let's not follow our evil bodily desires.
\v 13 And let's not surrender the members of our bodies to become instruments for doing evil. But let's surrender our whole lives to be on God's side! For in the past we were dead spiritually, but now our spirits have been brought back to life. So let's use the members of our bodies as instruments to do God's will!
\v 14 For the power of sin no longer controls our lives, because we've already died to all the old obligations— including all the rules in the Law. Now we're obligated to live as people who are thankful because God's kindness has been given to us.
\s We as people owned by the Lord must live to please Him
\p
\v 15 Of course some people will ask, “If God is kind to us, and if we aren't obligated to live according to the Law anymore, does that mean we can just keep sinning?” Absolutely not!
\v 16 You certainly know that if you surrender yourself to do the will of another person, you have become his servant. Similarly if you do sin you become a slave to that sin— which traps you into death. Or you can surrender yourself to be God's servant— and as a result you obey and have a good relationship with Him.
\v 17 Praise the Lord, we no longer become slaves to sin! But with all our hearts, we've obeyed the teaching that we've received from God,
\v 18 with the result that we are freed from sin's power and now live as God's servants who want with all our hearts to live right in His eyes.
\v 19 Those examples of mine were very simple, because it's easier for us who have human weaknesses to understand this spiritual principle. In the past, we gave the members of our bodies to be slaves of sin and evil. As a result we lived only for evil. But it's the opposite now, we have to give ourselves to become God's servants who always try to do what's right according to His will. Now we live only for God.
\p
\v 20 We were slaves of sin in the past, and almost never thought of living right.
\v 21 Living like that only made us ashamed. And the result of living like that was spiritual death.
\v 22 But now we've been freed from the power of sin to become God's servants. That means we live as people whom He has made holy, and that will produce eternal life.
\v 23 For sin traps us into spiritual death. But if we're one with our Lord Christ Jesus, then God will always be kind to us and will give us eternal life!
