\p Dear Brothers and Sisters in the faith in Rome:
\v 1 Greetings from Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus. God has called me to become an apostle, with the task to tell the Good News from God to everyone.
\v 2 In times past, God had promised to give that Good News to us, through the words of the prophets which are written in the Holy Bible.
\v 3-4 That Good News explains about God's Son and our Lord Christ Jesus. He's worthy to be called God's Son because of these two things: First, as a human being, He was born from the descendants of David.\f + \fk descendants of David \ft All of the kings of Israel were called 'sons of David'. As the leader of the people of Israel, the king was also called 'a son of God'— with a small letter for ‘son’. In Ps. 2, God also called all the people of Israel His ‘children’. (Ex. 4:23; Hos. 11:2) In the New Testament, 'the son of David' was also understood to be another name for the 'Messiah', or the King of Salvation who was promised.\f* Second, with amazing power, Jesus was proven to be God's Son. That happened when the Holy Spirit brought Him back to life from among the dead.
\p
\v 5 Through Christ's kindness, I received a special ministry from God to be an apostle of Christ. I have the duty to lead people from all people groups to believe in and obey Christ.
\v 6 And you in Rome are also included among those who are called to become Christ Jesus' possessions.
\p
\v 7 I'm writing this letter to you Brothers and Sisters in Rome, who are loved by God, who are called to become His holy people.
\p I pray that God the Father and our Lord Christ Jesus always be kind to each of you, and guard you so that you live calmly under God the Father's and our Lord's protection!
\s Paul's desire to tell the Good News in the capital city of Rome
\p
\v 8 First— to God whom I worship through Christ Jesus, I wholeheartedly give thanks because you already believe in Him. All over the world, people are telling that you who are in Rome really believe in Him.
\v 9 So I keep praying for you. And my Witness is God, whom I serve with my whole heart by telling the Good News about His Son.
\v 10 I've prayed for a long time, and truly begged that God would allow me to visit you.
\v 11 I desire to meet you in order to share spiritual blessing which can encourage you.
\v 12 I mean that when I'm with you, we can encourage each other to believe in Christ more.
\p
\v 13 Brothers and Sisters, I want you to know that many times I've planned to visit you, but until now there has always been an obstacle. I want to come so that my work among you will also produce well later on— just like what I've produced among non-Jews in other places.
\p
\v 14 For I feel obligated to serve everyone— including Greek people who have a high level of language and culture as well as people who are backward, both educated and as yet uneducated people.
\v 15 Because of that, I want to tell the Good News to you who live in Rome too.
\s The theme of this letter
\p
\v 16 I'm very proud of that Good News, because God works through that powerful news to save everyone who fully believes it— whether Jews or non-Jews.
\v 17 For that news shows how God makes people right before Him— which is only because of believing.\f + \fk only because of believing \ft Literally, “from faith to faith.” This idiomatic phrase in the Greek language can also be translated, “which happens only because of believing— and even increasingly being certain of that news.”\f* That agrees with what's written in God's Word, “The one who's considered righteous by the Lord will live forever, because he completely believes in Him.”\x + Hab. 2:4; Gal. 3:11; Heb. 10:38.\x*
\s All humans deserve to be punished by God
\p
\v 18 That Good News is important, because God's anger toward all the sin and evil of mankind has begun to be revealed from heaven. For that sin and evil are obstacles for mankind to know the true teaching from God.
\v 19 What people must know about God is already very clear, because He Himself has revealed that to mankind.
\p
\v 20 For since the creation of the world, His character as God has been seen clearly, seen in everything that was created by Him. And because of that, we understand things about Him that can't be seen with the eye, that is His state as God, and that He has eternal power. So mankind doesn't have an excuse not to know God.
\v 21 Although they know Him like that, they don't glorify Him as God and aren't thankful to Him, so as a result they think useless and foolish things, and their thinking is full of darkness.
\v 22 They say that they're wise, but they're obviously stupid.
\v 23 They refuse to glorify God— as we should do to Him who lives forever. Instead, they worship idols which they make themselves in the form of creatures that can die— that is in the form of people, birds, four-legged animals, and creeping animals.
\p
\v 24 Because of that, God released His hands and allowed them to be enslaved by their evil desires. And as a result, they defile each others bodies by doing shameful things.
\v 25 Even though they know the true things about God, they choose to believe in what's wrong. Instead of worshiping and serving Him who created everything, they prefer to worship His creation. However, He alone is worthy to be praised forever! Amen.
\p
\v 26 Because people are like that, God lets them be enslaved by their shameful desires. One example is that some women have sexual relations with other women, even though that isn't natural and actually shouldn't be done.
\v 27 It's the same with men. They begin to feel bored of natural sexual relations with women, and want to do shameful things in sexual relations with fellowmen. Because of that, they receive God's punishment within themselves, according to their shameful lifestyle.
\p
\v 28 Mankind evidently didn't feel they needed to know God any longer. Because of that God again released His hands and let them be enslaved by their worthless thoughts, with the result that people do what they shouldn't do more and more.
\v 29 So their hearts are controlled by every kind of sin, including evil thoughts, self-importance, and hatred. Their thoughts are full of envy, desires to murder, quarreling, cheating and holding grudges. They tell false stories about other people
\v 30 and slander each other. They hate God. And they're very crude, haughty, and boast about themselves. They cleverly think of new ways to do evil, and don't obey their parents.
\v 31 They're stupid, don't keep their promises, and don't know how to show kindness and compassion to other people.
\v 32 They already know God's Law which says that a person who lives like that deserves the death sentence. But they just keep living in wickedness, and praise others who do evil too.
