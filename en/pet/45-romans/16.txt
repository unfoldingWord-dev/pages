\c 16
\s Final words from Paul
\p
\v 1 I request that you desire to know and trust Phoebe— our sister in the faith. She has been assigned as a special servant to the church in Cenchraea.
\v 2 Accept her— as is appropriate for God's people, because she's one with Christ. Please help her with anything she needs, because she herself has helped many people— including myself.
\q
\v 3 Give my greetings to Priscilla and Aquila. They work with me because they're one with Christ Jesus too.
\v 4 They've risked their lives to save my life. I'm very grateful to them, and not just I, but all of the non-Jewish churches are also grateful to them because of that.
\q
\v 5 Give my greetings to the church that meets in their house too.
\q Give my greetings to my dearly loved friend Epaenetus. He was the first person in Asia who became a follower of Christ.
\v 6 Give my greetings to Mary. She has worked hard for the church in Rome.
\q
\v 7 Give my greetings to Andronicus and Junia. They're Jews like me and were also in prison with me. They became followers of Christ before I did, and the two of them are known as messengers of Christ to do His work.\f + \fr 16:7 \fk messengers … \ft Literally, “apostles.” See the note in Luke 6:13.\f*
\q
\v 8 Give my greetings to Ampliatus, whom I love in the Lord.
\q
\v 9 Give my greetings to Urbanus, my friend in our ministry for Christ.
\q Also give my greetings to my beloved close friend Stachys.
\q
\v 10 Give my greetings to Apelles. He has been tested and proven that his love for Christ is pure.
\q Give my greetings to everyone in the family of Aristobulus.
\q
\v 11 Give my greetings to my friend Herodion— who's from my people group.
\q Give my greetings to the family of Narcissus, our brothers and sisters in the faith in Christ.
\q
\v 12 Give my greetings to Tryphaena and Tryphosa. Both of those women truly work to serve the Lord.
\q Give my greetings to my close friend, whom I love— Persis. He also works hard for the glory of the Lord.
\q
\v 13 Give my greetings to Rufus. He's a very special person in the Lord's eyes.
\q And give my greetings to his mother too— who has become like my own mother.
\q
\v 14 Give my greetings to Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas and the brothers in the faith who are with them.
\q
\v 15 Give my greetings to Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, along with Olympas, and also to all of God's people who are with them.
\q
\v 16 Brothers and Sisters, as people who've been made pure by God, you should give each other greetings full of love.\f + \fk made pure… greetings full of love \ft Literally, “holy kiss.”\f*
\q All of the churches of Christ send greetings to you.
\p
\v 17 Brothers and sisters, I advise you to watch out for people who like to cause division. Beware of people who like to destroy the faith of other people. They oppose the true teaching that you've received. Stay far away from them.
\v 18 People like that don't serve Christ— our Lord. They just want to please themselves. They use fine words to trick people who are naive.
\p
\v 19 But all the brothers in the faith have heard about you— the church in Rome, that you're very obedient to the Lord Jesus. So I really rejoice because of you! But I ask you to remain wise about everything that's good, and keep feeling that you don't need to know anything about what's evil.
\v 20 God— He who always guards us so that we live with the feeling of calm, will soon destroy the devil and submit him under our authority. My prayer is that our Lord Jesus will always be kind to you.
\p
\v 21 Timothy, my close friend in ministry, sends greetings to you. Greetings from the friends of my own people too— Lucius, Jason, and Sosipater.
\p
\v 22 I, Tertius, also send greetings to you in the Lord. I'm the one who helped Paul write this letter— according to what he said.
\p
\v 23-24 Greetings from Gaius to you. He has allowed me, Paul, and the whole church here to use his house. Erastus and Quartus, our brother in the faith, send greetings to you. Erastus is the treasurer of this city.\f + \fr 16:24 \fk difference in copies \ft There are some copies in the Greek language that add these words: “May our Lord Christ Jesus keep being kind to all of you. Amen.” Some other copies put these words after verse 27.\f*
\p
\v 25 Glory to God! He's the one who can strengthen you so that you keep believing in Christ according to the Good News that I teach— which is what God has revealed to us. That's the plan of God about Christ Jesus, which was kept secret from people since the beginning.
\v 26 But now God has revealed that plan of His. First, it was revealed in the writings of the prophets— which were written according to what God commanded. Now we proclaim that news to all people groups, so that they fully believe in Christ and obey God who lives forever.
\v 27 He's the one and only God who's full of wisdom. Give glory to our God through Christ Jesus forever! Amen.
