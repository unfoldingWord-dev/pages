\v 1 My Brothers and Sisters, the longing of my heart and my sincere request to God is that all the Jews will be saved.
\v 2 I know well that the Jews sincerely try to live to please God's heart, but their efforts aren't based on correct understanding.
\v 3 For they don't understand how God makes people righteous. So they try in their own way— not in God's way. And because of that, they don't want to obey and follow the way God determined.
\v 4 They don't understand that Christ has fulfilled all of the rules in the Law for us. So everyone who fully believes in Jesus is made right before God— without relying on those rules any more.
\p
\v 5 About the way to be made right by obeying the rules of the Law Moses wrote, “The person who's considered to be righteous before God has to follow all of the rules of this Law.”\x + Lev. 18:5.\x*
\v 6-7 Because of that it would be best for us to wholeheartedly obeh what is also written about people who are made right by God because they believe in Him— which is, “You don't need to go up to the highest sky and go down to the deepest foundation of the earth anymore.” The meaning of that Word of the Lord is: You no longer need to seek the way to heaven in order to bring Christ down to the world so that He can help you, and you don't need to go down to the world of the dead to bring Christ up here. For Christ is already near us.
\p
\v 8 So the new way to be saved that we're sharing isn't difficult! It's also like what's stated in the Holy Bible, “The true message from God is already near you, in your mouth and in your heart.”\x + Deut. 30:12-14.\x*
\v 9 And this is God's message: If you admit with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, and fully believe in your heart that God has brought Jesus back to life from among dead people, then you'll be saved.
\v 10 It' like this: If we fully believe like that in our hearts, then we're made right in God's sight. Then we clearly admit with our mouths that we follow Jesus, so we're saved.
\v 11 For in the Holy Bible it's written, “Whoever believes in Him won't be disappointed.”\x + Isa. 28:16.\x*
\v 12 God's statement is valid for everyone— both for Jews and for people who aren't Jews. For there's only one God for everyone, and He abundantly blesses everyone who asks for His help.
\v 13 For God's Word also says, “Everyone who cries out to the Lord asking for his help will be saved.”\x + Joel 2:32.\x*
\p
\v 14 But how can people ask for His help if they don't yet believe in Him? And how can people believe in Him if they haven't yet heard about Him? And how can people hear about Him if there isn't anyone telling about Him?
\v 15 And how can we tell them about Him if we aren't sent? As it's written in the Holy Bible, “The coming\f + \fr 10:15 \fk coming \ft Literally, “feet.”\f* of the people who are sent to tell the Good News is so beautiful.”\x + Isa. 52:7\x*
\p
\v 16-17 So people become believers because they hear the news that's told to them. And they hear the news because there's a person who tells about Christ. But not everyone is ready to receive the Good News. That's why the Prophet Isaiah complained to God, “Lord, hardly anyone believes the news that You ordered me to tell.”\x + Is. 53:1.\x*
\p
\v 18 But what about the Jews? Can they say that they haven't yet heard this news? They have no reason to talk like that— because the Lord's Word says,
\q1 “The sun, moon, and all of the stars speak the news about God
\q2 to the whole world, that He's the one who created everything.
\q1 So people have no reason
\q2 not to know God.”\x + Ps. 19:5\x*
\m
\v 19 But I'm asking again: Why is it that the people of Israel can't seem to understand the Good News? First we need to remember that God had said through Moses,
\q1 “I will make you jealous
\q2 when I bless other people groups whom you consider to be useless.
\q1 And as a tool to make you angry,
\q2 I will use people groups who didn't know Me in the past.”\x + Deut. 32:21\x*
\m
\v 20 Then the Prophet Isaiah boldly delivered these words of God:
\q1 “People groups that didn't seek Me in the past
\q2 will find Me.
\q1 And I will reveal Myself to people
\q2 who don't know Me.”\x + Is. 65:1\x*
\m
\v 21 But concerning the people of Israel God says,
\q1 “I've held out My hand too long and waited for them to return to Me,
\q2 but they keep hardening their hearts, and don't want to obey Me.”\x + Is. 65:2\x*
