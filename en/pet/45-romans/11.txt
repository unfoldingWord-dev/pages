\c 11
\s God is still planning to bless His chosen people
\p
\v 1 Does that mean God has decided to reject the people of Israel— His own chosen people?! Certainly not! And I, myself, am one example. I'm an Israelite, Abraham's descendant, from the tribe of Benjamin.
\v 2 God certainly won't reject them— that is the people whom He chose from the beginning. And you should remember what was written in the Holy Bible about Elijah. He sincerely prayed to God, asking that the people of Israel be punished, saying,
\v 3 “Oh Lord, they've killed Your prophets and destroyed Your altars. I'm the only prophet who's still alive. And they're trying to kill me too!”\x + 1 Kings 19:10, 14.\x*
\v 4 But what was God's answer to Elijah? He said, “I've chosen and kept seven thousand people of Israel for Myself— that is those who've never worshipped Baal.”\x + 1 Kings 19:18.\x*
\p
\v 5 So at the present time too: There's still a small number of the people of Israel whom God has chosen as His people, just because of His kindness.
\v 6 God chose a number of these people just because of His kindness, and not because of the good things they've ever done for God. If God had chosen them based on their deeds, then His choice is no longer because of His kindness.
\p
\v 7 So this is what happened: In general, the Israelites didn't get what they sought through their own efforts— which was how to be made right in God's sight. And only a small number got that— that is the people who were chosen by God. But the others hardened their hearts.
\v 8 As it's written in the Holy Bible,
\q1 “God made them unaware—
\q2 like people who are sleeping.”\x + Is. 29:10\x*
\q1 “Even to this day, God hasn't yet allowed them
\q2 to see with their eyes.
\q1 And He closed their ears,
\q2 so that they couldn't hear.”\x + Deut. 29:4\x*
\m
\v 9 And David prays,
\q1 “Lord, let them feel satisfied with an abundance of food and riches
\q2 so that they forget You.
\q1 And allow their prosperity to become a trap
\q2 that catches them.
\q1
\v 10 Let their eyes remain closed,
\q2 so that they aren't aware of what's happening to them.
\q1 And may they be punished, so that they keep living in trouble
\q2 and carry heavy burdens— so that they are bent over forever.”\x + Ps. 69:23-24\x*
\p
\v 11 For that reason, certainly some of you will ask: “If the people of Israel have stumbled like that, does that mean that they'll never be saved?” By no means! But as a result of their wrongs, the way of salvation for non-Jewish people groups has been opened. That's included in God's plan, so that if the Jewish people see the blessings given to non-Jewish people, they'll feel jealous.
\v 12 The Jewish people are guilty because of the hardness of their hearts, so that the opportunity opened up for all non-Jewish people groups to receive amazing blessings. But just think how much more amazing the blessing to the whole world will be when God calls the Jewish people to return, and they also follow the way of salvation.
\p
\v 13 Now I'm speaking to you who aren't Jewish people. I was sent as an apostle to non-Jewish people. So I make the effort so that my ministry will bring results and be praised.
\v 14 For I hope that by doing that, my own people become jealous of other people groups. In that way, I hope that some of them are helped and are saved.
\v 15 My intent is that when God turned away from the Jewish people, it meant that an opportunity opened up for all the other people groups in this world to be at peace with God. So at the time God receives the Jewish people back, that will certainly be surprising— as if those people have been brought back to life from death, and the whole world will join in rejoicing.
\v 16 That will happen, for sure, because if their forefathers were accepted and made right by God,\f + \fr 11:16 \fk forefathers… were also made right \ft The first part of this verse is literally, “If the first part (of the dough) is holy, all of the dough is holy.” The illustration of dough wasn't kept so that this is clear. The meaning of the illustration of dough is the same as the illustration of an olive tree in the second part of the verse.\f* then at a later time, their offspring will certainly join in being made right too. For the Jewish people group is like an olive tree planted in God's field as His own special possession. That means the branches remain His possessions too.
\p
\v 17 What has happened now is as if some branches of God's olive tree were cut off and thrown away. Part of the Jewish people are like those branches. Then other branches were attached to His olive tree, and those branches were taken from a wild olive tree. Those are you people groups who aren't Jewish! Now you receive life and strength from the root of the tree that was planted by God.
\v 18 So you branches who were just attached can't consider yourselves to be greater than the original branches that were cut off and thrown away! And remember: It isn't you that give life to the root, but it's the root that gives life to you.
\v 19 But of those of you who aren't Jews, there will for sure be some who say, “Yes, true, but one of the former branches was cut off so that I could be attached to this tree of God's.”
\v 20 That's true! But you need to remember that the first branches were cut off because they didn't believe. And you non-Jews can remain one with that tree only because you believe. So don't become arrogant. It's better for you to fear being cut off too!
\v 21 For if God didn't allow those first branches to stay connected, then you could also be cut off if you stop believing.
\p
\v 22 So now it has been proven that God's kindness is truly amazing, and His punishment is also truly terrifying! For He'll give a harsh punishment to people who don't want to follow the way of salvation which was given by Him, but He's very kind to you— if you continue to depend on His kindness! If you don't, you'll be cut off from His tree too.
\v 23 And if the Jews aren't hard-headed anymore, and believe in the news of salvation from God, then they'll also be reattached to that tree. And God is certainly able to do that!
\v 24 It wasn't a normal thing that happened to you non-Jewish people, because the branches of a wild olive tree are seldom attached to an olive tree planted in a garden. The Jewish people are like the original branches from the olive tree in God's garden. So the original branches will be more easily reattached to their original tree.
\p
\v 25 Brothers and sister who aren't Jews, I want to reveal this mystery to you, so that you don't become arrogant and brag about yourselves: For the time being, God has made it so that some of the Jewish people are hard-headed. But that will change when everyone whom God has invited from other people groups have joined with us.
\v 26 When that happens, God will open up the way of salvation again to all of the people of Israel. That's in agreement with God's words in the Holy Bible that say,
\q1 “Your Savior will appear in the holy city— which is Jerusalem.\f + \fr 11:26 \fk holy city … Yerusalem \ft Literally, “Zion.”\f*
\q2 and He'll remove all evil from the descendants of Jacob.
\q1
\v 27 And I will fulfill My promise with them
\q2 when I wipe away their sins.”\x + Is. 59:20-21; 27:9\x*
\p
\v 28 For the Jews didn't want to receive the Good News from God, so they became His enemies. That happened in order to open up the opportunity for you non-Jews to be saved. But the Jews are still God's chosen people, whom He loves very much. He still loves them because of His promises to their forefathers.
\v 29 For if God chooses and blesses people, He never changes His plan and doesn't take His blessing back from them.
\v 30 In the past, you non-Jewish people didn't want to obey God. But now you've received His mercy in order to repent. That happened because for the time being, the Jews don't want to obey.
\v 31 It can also be explained like this: The Jews don't want to obey now because, for the time being, God is showing His mercy to you. But that's happening so that in days to come, they'll also have another opportunity to receive His mercy!
\v 32 God has obviously arranged it so that every people group experiences a time when they're enslaved by sin and don't want to obey God! In that way, He opens up an opportunity for everyone to receive His mercy.
\s Praise God
\p
\v 33 It's so true, our God is really kind to all of us! His wisdom and knowledge can't be understood by human beings. And we can't possibly understand His decisions, and how He arranges everything.
\v 34 As it's written in the Holy Bible,
\q1 “Who knows the Lord's thoughts?
\q2 Who's able to become an adviser to God?”\x + Is. 40:13\x*
\q1
\v 35 “Who has ever loaned anything to God—
\q2 so that He's obligated to pay him something?”\x + Job 41:11\x*
\p
\v 36 For God alone has created everything. And everything continues to exist through Him, and for Him. May all the glory be given to Him forever. Amen.
