\c 13
\s Obey government rules
\p
\v 1 We should all obey the government, because no official sits in government without God's permission. And every official who rules now, has been appointed by God.
\v 2 So everyone who opposes the government is actually opposing what has been set up by God. And whoever does that will bring punishment on himself.
\v 3 For people who do good don't need to be afraid of the government. So if you want to be free from fear of the government, do what's good, then you'll receive praise from those who govern.
\p
\v 4 For each government official is God's servant who serves for your sake. But if you do evil, you'll be afraid of them, for sure! And don't think you can escape from the authority of the officials to punish you. For they're also God's servants who have the duty to punish people who do evil.
\v 5 So we have to obey the government— not because of being afraid of punishment if we don't obey, but we obey because we know that it's proper and right in God's eyes.
\p
\v 6 We pay taxes to the government for that reason too, because government authorities work for God and give most of their time to govern.
\v 7 So give to each government worker according to what's proper to give. If you owe taxes, pay them. And give duty payments to those who have the right to receive duty. Respect and obey all of the government officials and everyone who deserves to be respected.
\s Loving others is the most important law
\p
\v 8 Don't owe anything to anyone— except to owe love to one another. For when we love our fellowman, it means that we're also fulfilling the whole point of the Law about relationships between our fellowmen.
\v 9 For it's written in the Law, “Don't commit adultery, don't kill, don't steal, don't desire the possessions of another person.”\x + Ex. 20:13-15, 17.\x* The Law consists of many commands, of course, but the point of all of those commands is actually one— which is “Love others like you love yourself.”
\v 10 For by loving, we won't hurt other people, of course. So in loving, it's the same as if we're obey, the whole Law.
\p
\v 11 I'm giving this advice because it's very proper for those of us who live in this age. For the time has come now for us to wake up from sleep. For the time for us to be saved is much nearer now than when we first began to believe.
\v 12 Night has almost passed, and day will come soon. For that reason, we should stop doing everything that comes from darkness. And let's prepare ourselves by equipping ourselves with weapons that come from the light, in order to oppose all the powers of darkness.
\v 13 We should live right, like people who are in the light. Let's not have wild parties and get drunk, and let's not commit immorality or other sins with our bodies either. Don't quarrel with each other, and don't envy each other.
\v 14 But let's become like our Lord Christ Jesus, so that when people see what we do, it's as if they see Christ in us. And don't think about satisfying your own desires anymore.
