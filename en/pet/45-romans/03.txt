\v 1 So of course, some Jews will ask, “If that's so, are we Jews still better in God's eyes than people who aren't Jews? Does God consider us better because we've been circumcised?”
\v 2 Of course we Jews, (including myself), have many traditions that can help us obey God. But the most important thing is that God has entrusted His promises to us.
\v 3 Will that be a problem if there are Jews who aren't faithful to God? Will that make God not fulfill His promises too?
\v 4 No! God will still do whatever is according to His promises, even though everyone turns out to be liars. As it was written in the Holy Bible when someone said to God,
\b
\q1 “You'll be proven right in all of Your words,
\q2 and You'll defeat those who say
\q2 that You've done wrong.”\x + Ps. 51:6\x*
\p
\v 5 But sometimes there are some of us Jews\f + \fk Jews \ft Literally, “people who are circumcised.”\f* who say, “We're God's chosen race, so how can God be angry with us if we commit sin? Doesn't that still glorify God— because our sins show that He's kind and faithful to His promises? If so, God shouldn't destroy us because of that sin.” But that's just human thinking,
\v 6 and completely wrong! If God isn't just toward all mankind, then He can't judge this world.
\p
\v 7 But aperson may say, “For example, if I sin by deceiving someone, that will only make it more clear that God is always right. Doesn't that still glorify God? So God doesn't treat me justly if He punishes me because of that sin.”
\v 8 But that's the same as saying, “Let's do evil so that good happens.” There are people who spread the false story that we teach like that. People who talk like that deserve punishment from God!
\s All men are sinful
\p
\v 9 Are we Jews better than people who aren't Jews? No! We've already said that all people— both Jews and non-Jews, are already under the power of the desire to commit sin.
\v 10 Like it's written in the Holy Bible,
\q1 “No one lives right—
\q2 not one single person!
\q1
\v 11 No one lives wisely.
\q2 No one truly lives to please God.
\q1
\v 12 Everyone has turned away from God,
\q2 and everyone lives worthlessly in God's eyes.
\q1 No one does good.
\q2 No one at all!”\x + Ps. 14:1-3\x*
\q1
\v 13 “Other people die because of the evil words that come out of their mouths.
\q2 They just use their tongues to lie.”\x + Ps. 5:10\x*
\q1 “Their words are like snake's venom,”\x + Ps. 140:4\x*
\q1
\v 14 “their mouths are full of curses and bitterness.”\x + Ps. 10:7\x*
\q1
\v 15 “They're always ready to hurt and kill.
\q2
\v 16 Wherever they go,
\q2 they cause destruction and trouble.
\q1
\v 17 They don't know how to live at peace with their fellowman.”\x + Is. 59:7-8\x*
\q1
\v 18 “They don't fear and honor God.”\x + Ps. 36:2\x*

\v 19 All of those quotes from the book of the Law don't accuse just the non-Jews, but accuse the Jews too, of course— who are the people group that inherited the Law! Those verses show that each person no matter from what people group has no reason to justify himself before God and deserves to be punished by God.
\v 20 For there isn't even one person who'll be made right before God by keeping the Law. But the Law always points out our sins.
\s How man is made right before God
\p
\v 21 But God has shown a new way for man to be made right before Him. The way to be made right isn't based on the Law, but the Law and the words of the prophets have testified about that.
\v 22 The way is that God makes everyone right only by fully believing in Christ Jesus. God does that for everyone who believes in Christ, because all people groups have the same spiritual needs.
\v 23 For everyone has sinned and is unworthy to enjoy God's glory.
\v 24 People are made right before God only because of His kindness, and that's given freely through Christ Jesus, who redeemed and freed us from the punishment for our own sins.
\v 25 God has sent Jesus to open up the way, so that everyone who fully believes in Jesus is forgiven of their sins, and God is no longer angry with him. That forgiveness is based on the blood of Jesus when He died for us. In that way, God showed that He always does what's right and just. In times past, God remained patient and didn't destroy people because of their sins.
\v 26 For at that time, God had planned to make people right through Jesus. And now God also does what's right and just when He makes sinners right because they believe in Jesus.
\p
\v 27 So because of that, there's no longer any reason for one people group to brag about themselves by saying that God is more pleased with them than other people groups. Why not? We are made right only because we fully believe in what Jesus has done— not as a result of our own efforts to obey the Law!
\v 28 So we can say this: We're not made right by God because we obey the Law, but because we fully believe in Jesus.
\v 29 If that wasn't so, we Jews could just say that God only cares about the Jews. But actually, all people groups belong to God.
\v 30 For there's only one God. He's the one who makes the Jews\f + \fr 3:30 \fk Jews\ft Literally, “people who are circumcised.” And in this verse, “the non-Jews”, literally, “people who aren't circumcised”.\f* right before Him because they believe in Jesus. And He's also the one who makes non-Jews right before Him because they believe in Jesus too.
\v 31 Of course there'll be people who'll ask, “Does this mean that the Law doesn't need to be kept because believing in Jesus is now more important for us?” Certainly not! Through faith in Jesus we truly do obey the purpose of the Law!
