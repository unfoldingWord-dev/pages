\s God and the Israelites
\p
\v 1 But now I want to reveal my great sorrow! And what I'm saying now is very true. I'm not lying. I know this because I'm one with Christ, and because the Holy Spirit gives assurance that this is true in God's sight.
\v 2 What I want to say is that my heart is very sad because of the Israelites.
\v 3 For they're my brothers and sisters of the same people group, and they're like my own flesh and blood in this world. So I really want to help them— even to the point that I'm willing to be cursed and separated from Christ for them, if only that would save them!
\v 4 For they're the people of Israel who have been chosen by God and appointed to become His children. He even has shown His glory to them, made His great promises official with them, and given the Law to them. This includes the rules on how to worship God in His Temple, and He's also given promises about their future.
\v 5 They're the descendants of the Jewish forefathers. And they're the family of Christ in a physical way on this earth— even though actually Christ is God over everything. Praise to Him forever. Amen.
\p
\v 6 As I've said, those who are of the same people group as me make me very sad, but it doesn't mean that God won't fulfill His promises to them. For those promises were actually just given to true Israelites. You should realize that not everyone born from the Israelite people is considered by God to be a true Israelite.
\v 7 So not all of Abraham's descendants are included in God's family that He promised to Abraham. But God said to him, “Only the offspring of Isaac will be called your descendants.”\x + Gen. 21:12; Heb. 11:18\x*
\v 8 That means that when the Lord gave His promises to Abraham regarding his family, He didn't mean that all of Abraham's biological children were included in his family. But God meant that His promises were just for Abraham's descendants who were chosen by God to be Abraham's true descendants. Only those who were chosen as Abraham's descendants are considered to be God's family.\f + \fr 9:8 \fk God's family \ft Literally, “God's children.” In the Holy Bible, the people of Israel are called “God's(only) child,” “God's firstborn child”, and also “God's children.” (Ex. 4:22-23; Isa. 1:2; Hos. 1:10) The people of Israel are considered to be God's children because He saved them and chose them to be His family. (Deut. 14:1-2)\f*
\v 9 For God promised Abraham, “In this same month next year, I will return, and Sarah will have had a son.”\x + Gen. 18:10, 14.\x*
\p
\v 10 There's another example too. The same thing happened to Rebekah, when she was pregnant with twins by her husband Isaac— our forefather.
\v 11-13 Before those two children were born, God had already told Rebekah, “The descendants of the older child will serve the descendants of the younger child.”\x + Gen. 25:23.\x* And God told her that before those two children had done anything good or evil. This agrees with what's written in the Holy Bible, “I will love Jacob, but I will hate Esau.”\x + Mal. 1:2-3.\x* In that way it's clear that God is the one who determines and chooses according to His plan, and it's not based on what people do.
\p
\v 14 So what do we learn from that example? Does that mean God isn't fair to people. Not at all!
\v 15 For God has the right to choose anyone— like what He said to Moses. “If I want to have compassion on anyone, I will have compassion on him. And if I want to be kind to anyone, I will be kind to him.”\x + Ex. 33:19.\x*
\v 16 So it doesn't depend on the will or the effort of a person, but it just depends on the kindness of God.
\v 17 An example in the Holy Bible is where God says to the king of Egypt, “I made you king for this purpose alone: So that everyone in this world will know Me through the great power that I show you.”\x + Ex. 9:16.\x*
\v 18 So it's clear that God makes people hard-headed according to His will, and He also shows compassion to the people He chooses.
\p
\v 19 Because of that certainly some will ask me, “If it's God who controls who becomes hard-headed or not, then why does He still blame us if we're hard-headed?”
\v 20 But we can't talk like that! We're just human beings. And humans don't have the right to tell God that He's wrong. A clay pot doesn't have the right to blame the potter who made it! I mean, a clay pot doesn't have the right to say, “Why did you shape me like this?!”
\v 21 The potter has the right to make a pot that's shaped according to his desire. He can use the same clay to make a pot particularly for a special use, or a pot for everyday needs.
\p
\v 22 Now God acts like the potter does. He wants to show mankind that He has the right— either to show His power or His wrath against the sin of mankind. He also has the right to save whom He wants to. So God also has the right to be patient with people who make Him angry— that is the people whom He has prepared to be destroyed.
\v 23-24 And God also has the right to work patiently with the people whom He has chosen and prepared to receive His compassion— that is those of us who'll see how abundant and glorious His compassion is. For He's the one who has chosen us— not just from among the Jews, but also from among people who aren't Jews.
\v 25 This agrees with what was written about non-Jews in the book of Hosea,
\q1 “To people who weren't included as My own people in the past,
\q2 I will say, 'You're My people.'
\q1 And to a people group that I didn't love in the past,
\q2 I will say, 'You're the people I love.'’\x + Hosea 2:23\x*
\q1
\v 26 “And to the residents of each region where God once said,
\q2 'You aren't My people,'
\q2 even there, the residents will be called 'children of the living God.'”\x + Hosea 1:10\x*
\m
\v 27 Whereas the Prophet Isaiah has prophesied distinctly about the people of Israel saying,
\q1 “Even though the total number of the Israelite people is as many as the sand on the shore,
\q2 yet only a few will be saved.
\q1
\v 28 For God will quickly inflict punishment on all the people of this world.”\x + Isa. 10:22-23.\x*
\m
\v 29 And in another verse Isaiah prophesied about the Jews again,
\q1 “The Lord Almighty
\q2 only allowed some of our people group to be saved.
\q1 If that wasn't so,
\q2 we would all be destroyed, just like the residents of Sodom
\q2 and we would become just like the residents of Gomorrah.”\x + Isa. 1:9.\x*
\p
\v 30 So what do we learn from all of this? The conclusion is as follows: In the past, the non-Jews didn't seek God, of course, and didn't try to become right in His sight. But now, through fully believing in Christ, an opportunity has opened for them to become right in God's sight.
\v 31 Whereas the Jews, of course, have tried hard to live right in God's sight by carrying out the Law, but they didn't succeed.
\v 32 Why didn't they succeed? Because they refused to fully believe in God, and tried to make themselves right before God based on their own works. They stumbled on the stumbling stone
\v 33 that's mentioned in the Holy Bible,
\q1 “Pay attention, I'm putting a Stone in Zion
\q2 that will make people stumble,
\q2 that is a large Stone that will make people fall.
\q1 But people who fully believe in Him
\q2 won't be disappointed.”\x + Is. 8:14; 28:16\x*
