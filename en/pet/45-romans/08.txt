\s Living as one with God's Spirit
\p
\v 1 So now we who are one with Christ Jesus don't need to be afraid of the punishment that God has every right to give to us!
\v 2 Why don't we need to be afraid? Because we who are one with Christ Jesus have received God's Spirit which gives life! And His Spirit is what frees us from the power of sin in ourselves which previously always enrapped us into spiritual death.
\v 3 In the past, the Law couldn't help us to defeat our evil bodily desires. But God Himself is the one who has overcome that problem by sending His own Son into this world in the form of a weak human body. And His Son is the one who became the sacrifice to free us from all the punishment because of our sins. So through His sacrifice, He has defeated the power of sin— specifically the desires of our bodies which inclined us to commit sin.
\v 4 God did that so that the righteous way of life which the Law demands would be fulfilled in us because we're one with Christ, because we are now enabled to live in obedience to the guidance of God's Spirit, and no longer follow the desires of our bodies.
\p
\v 5 The life goal of everyone still lives following the will of the weak human body, is just to satisfy his own desires. But everyone who lives depending on the Holy Spirit is helped by Him to think according to His will.
\v 6 If the goal of our lives is only to satisfy our own desires, we are entrapped into the death of our spirits and souls. But if our lives are controlled by God's Spirit, we will have eternal life and will feel calm in the Lord's protection.
\v 7 If the goal of a person is just to satisfy the desires of his body, he opposes God. He doesn't want to obey the rules of God's Law, and is totally unable to do it.
\v 8 For a person who lives according to the desires of his own body can't possibly please God.
\p
\v 9 But each one of you who are one with Christ are no longer controlled by the desires of your bodies! Instead, you're controlled by God's Spirit, because Christ's Spirit is truly in you.\f + \fr 8:9 \fk God's Spirit … Christ's Spirit \ft There's no difference between God's Spirit— which is also called the Holy Spirit, and Christ's Spirit.\f* If the Holy Spirit is not within someone, that means he doesn't belong to Christ.
\v 10-11 Of course your body that always wants to commit those sins will still die. But if Christ lives in you, His Spirit will make your spirit and soul alive, because of living according to His Spirit's guidance, and made righteous by Him before God. And because God's Spirit lives in us— that is He who raised up Christ again from death, He'll also raise us up again with new bodies.
\p
\v 12 So my Brothers and Sisters, we're obligated now to live according to the guidance of God's Spirit. Let's not allow the desires of our bodies to entrap and guide our lives.
\v 13 For if we live according to the desires of our bodies, our spirits and souls will still die. Instead with the help of God's Spirit let us think that our bodies are dead toward the desire to sin, then we'll live!
\v 14 For everyone who is led by God's Spirit are members of God's family.
\v 15 For His Spirit isn't given to us to enslave us, so that we're afraid to face God. But His Spirit makes us His adopted children.\f + \fr 8:15 \fk His adopted children \ft The Greek language literally uses one word that means the 'adoption of sons'. That word was a Roman legal term which showed that our 'adoption' was legitimate, and we're all pictured as sons, because in Roman culture only sons had the right to receive an inheritance. The same word is used in Rom. 8:23, 9:4, Gal. 4:5, and Eph. 1:5.\f* And as proof, His Spirit now leads us to cry out to God, “Abba,\f + \fr 8:15 \fk Abba \ft a word in the Aramaic language that means ‘daddy’. Like the word ‘daddy’, ‘abba’ is also easily expressed by small children.\f* oh Daddy!”
\v 16 So His own Spirit assures our spirits that we are members of His family.
\v 17 And if we are members of His family, we have the right to enjoy all of the riches that have been promised to His family. As members of God's family, we own everything with Christ— our first-born adopted Brother.\f + \fr 8:17 \fk Verse 17a \ft Literally, “And if we are His children, we have also become heirs. Meaning that we— together with Christ, become God's heirs.”\f* And this is also proof: If we suffer for following Him, it is certain we will also take part in His glory!
\p
\s We'll take part in enjoying glory with Christ
\p
\v 18 Because of that, my opinion is that the suffering that we're experiencing now can't be compared with the glory that will be revealed to us.
\v 19 In this present age, the whole universe is actually waiting, and is as if truly longing for the moment when God will reveal all of His family members.\f + \fr 8:19 \ft When Paul wrote this part, every high king in the Roman government called himself the son of God. Each high king also announced that he was the one to bring peace to the whole universe. So what Paul wrote here opposed the teaching promoted by the Roman government.\f*
\v 20 For the whole universe has been hindered so that during this age it can't fulfill God's intent when He created it. That hindrance is part of God's plan, and that will continue until the fulfillment of His plan. And the plan of God
\v 21 is that the universe and all of His created beings will be freed from death and from everything that wants to destroy them, and they too will enjoy glory along with God's extended family.
\p
\v 22 For we know that the whole universe is as if heavy hearted and truly suffers until now— as if all created things were in severe pain and crying together.\f + \fr 8:22 \fk severe pain and crying \ft Translates one word that means ‘suffering the pain of childbirth together’.\f*
\v 23 And it isn't just the living creatures of this world that feel this trouble. But we who've received God's Spirit have heavy hearts too. However, His Spirit is a guarantee for us that we'll receive everything that God has promised. Because of that, we wait with confidence and joy for the moment God reveals everything that He has prepared for all His adopted children. At that very moment, our bodies will be freed from the power of sin and death.
\v 24 That's what we've begun to hope for since we were saved by Christ. And we still keep hoping for things like that until now. The time will come later on when we no longer need to hope for something, because all that we hope will have been fulfilled.
\v 25 But even though it hasn't happened yet, we wait for it with confidence and patience.
\p
\v 26 The Holy Spirit also helps us in our weakness. For we don't actually know how to pray for what's proper. But His own Spirit prays for us, and gives our requests to God, full of feelings, and in a way that can't be explained in human languages.
\v 27 God knows what's in the hearts of people of course. And God also knows as deeply as possible about the requests that are given by His own Spirit. And of course His Spirit makes requests of God for His people according to His will.
\p
\v 28 Now we can be sure that for all of us who love Him, God always arranges everything that we face and experience, so that those things produce good. For we're people who've been chosen by Him according to His plan.
\v 29 For from the beginning, God has known and loved us, and He planned that we would become like His Son. And His plan was also that Jesus would become the firstborn Son of many brothers and sisters.
\v 30 We've entered into God's plan from the beginning, and then we were called to become members of His family, and through Christ's work we were made right in His sight, and in the end we'll enjoy His glory.
\s All who oppose us cannot stop God from loving us
\p
\v 31 So what's our reaction to all of that? If God is on our side, everything that opposes us will never be able to defeat us.
\v 32 The proof of this is that God didn't spare His own Son so that He wouldn't experience suffering, but God Himself surrendered Him to be sacrificed for our salvation. If that's so, He'll certainly continue to be kind to us and give us everything else that He has promised us.
\v 33 So who else is bold enough to accuse us?! For we were chosen by God, and He's the one who has done those amazing things so that we're made right before Him.
\v 34 And what else can threaten us? Nothing! For Christ has died for us— and even has come back to life from death and is now sitting in the most honored place next to God, which is at His right side. From there He defends us and prays for us.
\v 35 If that's so, is there any other being that can stop Christ from loving us? There isn't! If we're oppressed, or face misery or persecution, does it mean that Christ no longer loves us? No! Or if those who oppose Christ make us, His followers, unable to buy food, or clothing, or even kill us, does that mean that Christ no longer loves us? No!
\p
\v 36 For those things keep happening to us, of course, as it's written in the Holy Bible,
\q1 “For Your sake, God, we're in danger of death every day.
\q2 And we're treated like sheep who are going to be slaughtered.”\x + Ps. 44:23\x*
\p
\v 37 But in everything we have complete victory through Christ who has shown His amazing love to us.
\v 38-39 For I'm convinced that nothing that opposes us can stop His love for us— neither those who hurt us while we're still alive, nor those who kill us. Neither angels— nor all of the evil spirits are able to hinder God so that He no longer loves us. And we no longer need to be afraid of any accusation or threat— whether accusations or threats at this present time, or those that will come, or from all the powers of darkness. For in all of God's creation— whether that power is in the highest part of the sky or in the lowest part of the earth, there's nothing that can stop God's love for us— which is the love that we have because we are one with our Lord Christ Jesus.
