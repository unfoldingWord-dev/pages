\v 1 We want to tell you about Him who's called the Word—\f + \fr 1:1 \fk Word \ft Translates “logos” in Greek. “Logos” can also be translated “word(s).” John uses that word as a title, or another name for Christ Himself, because through the King of Salvation, God communicates with people about Himself.\f* that is He who gives us life, and who already existed before the world was created. We've heard Him, and seen Him with our own eyes. And we truly have seen Him— we've even touched Him with our own hands.
\v 2 It's true, He who gives life was revealed to us, and we had many opportunities to see Him. Now we testify and give you a report about Him who gives eternal life— that is He who from the beginning lived with God the Father, and was revealed by the Father to us.
\v 3 So what we've seen and heard, we tell you, so that you and we have a close relationship in our fellowship. And it isn't just that we have a close relationship to each other, but we also have a close relationship with the Father and His Son— who is Christ Jesus.
\v 4 Because of that, we are writing this letter to you, so that through that close relationship our joy will be complete.
\s God forgives our sin
\p
\v 5 And this is the message that we've heard from God's Son and we're now telling you: God is like light, and there's no darkness in Him at all.
\v 6 So if we say that we have a close relationship with God, yet we still live like people who are in darkness, it means we're lying and aren't carrying out the true teachings from God.
\v 7 But if we live in the light like God lives in the light, we and our brothers and sisters in the faith will continue to have a close relationship, and the blood of Jesus—\f + \fr 1:7 \fk the blood of Jesus \ft The “blood of Jesus” illustrates Jesus' sacrifice on the cross.\f* who is God's Son, keeps cleansing us from every sin.
\p
\v 8 If one of our brothers says, “I don't sin,” it means that he hasn't accepted the true teaching from God, and he has deceived himself.
\v 9 But if we admit our sins to God, then according to His promise, God, who is very just and faithful, will definitely forgive us and cleanse our hearts from the evil things that we've done.
\v 10 If one of our brothers says, “I've never sinned,” it's las if he considers God to be a Liar, and obviously the true teachings from God haven't found a place in his heart.
