\s The children of God are victorious over the evil in this world
\p
\v 1 Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ\f + \fr 5:1 \fk Christ \ft See the footnote at 1John 2:22.\f* has received new birth from God the Father. And everyone who loves the Father, also loves each member of God's family— that is everyone who has also received new birth from the Father.
\v 2 This is how we know that we truly love each of the other children of God: If we love God and do His commands.
\v 3 Loving God means that we obey His commands. And that isn't too hard to do,
\v 4 because everyone who receives new birth from God is given the power to defeat the evil that's in this world. And what makes us victorious over the evil in this world is that we believe completely in Jesus.
\v 5 No one at all can defeat the evil in this world except for us who believe that Jesus is God's Son.
\s Our Savior came to earth as a human with a normal body
\p
\v 6 Christ Jesus is the only one who has come to earth showing these two signs from God— the sign of water and the sign of blood.\f + \fr 5:6 \fk water, blood \ft There are those who interpret that John means the water of baptism when Jesus was baptized, and the blood that was shed at the time of His death on the cross. But John was probably showing something that strengthened his teaching in 1 John 4:2-3 and 2 John 7. There are two good possibilities: 1) John meant the water that came out when Jesus was born, and the blood of his crucifixion. 2) John meant the water and blood that came out when Jesus' side was pierced with a spear after He was crucified. Notice the stress that John gives what happened in John 19:34-37. These two things show that Jesus had a normal human body. One false teaching in John's time was that Jesus only looked like a human, but didn't have a body like normal humans.\f* Jesus didn't show just the sign of water, but the sign of blood also. And the Holy Spirit— who can always be believed, also testifies to us that Jesus came from God with a normal human body.
\v 7 So God has given three true witnesses about Jesus—
\v 8 that is the Holy Spirit, water, and blood. And these three give the same testimony.
\p
\v 9-11 Think about this: We usually believe it when a person tells about something that he himself has seen. But it's even greater if the One who gives the testimony to us is God Himself! For the important things that God openly claims about His Son are summarized as follows: God has given eternal life to us, and that eternal life is only given to people who are one with His Son. Everyone who believes in God's Son is certain in his heart that these things are true. But whoever doesn't believe in these things that God claims, is saying that God is a Liar, because he refuses to believe God's testimony about His Son.
\v 12 Whoever has a close relationship with His Son has eternal life. But whoever doesn't have a close relationship with God's Son, doesn't have eternal life.
\s Our assurance about eternal life
\p
\v 13 I've written this letter to you who believe in\f + \fr 5:13 \fk believe in \ft Literally, “believe in the name.” According to Jewish culture at the time of Jesus, “name” meant the whole identity of Christ Jesus.\f* God's Son, so that you know that you have eternal life now.
\v 14 In that way we aren't afraid anymore to come before God in prayer! If what we ask is according to His will, God will listen to and answer our prayers.
\v 15 And if we are confident that God is answering our requests, we may be certain that we've received what we asked Him for.
\p
\v 16 One example is when we see our brother in the faith commit a sin. (Here I mean committing the kind of sin that doesn't result in eternal death.\f + \fr 5:16 \fk eternal death \ft Literally, “death.” John's intent here is almost the same as “second stage of death” in Rev. 20:6-14, 21:8— which is being thrown into the lake of hell firel. Although this is pictured as death, it's clear from Jesus' teaching that people who enter hell aren't totally destroyed, and are still eternally aware of their torture.\f*) We should ask God to save that brother, and God will give him life. (I emphasize again that I'm speaking about a person who commits a sin that doesn't result in eternal death. For there's a kind of sin that brings eternal death. I don't request that we ask God on behalf of a person who commits sin like that.
\v 17 All evil deeds are sin, but not all sin leads to eternal death.)
\p
\v 18 We know that everyone who has received new birth from God can't keep on sinning. For Jesus— God's own Son, always protects us, so that the devil\f + \fr 5:18 \fk the devil \ft Literally, “the evil one.”\f* can't do anything to us.
\v 19 We know that we've become children of God, even though the whole world is controlled by the devil.
\p
\v 20 We know that God's Son has come. He has given us understanding so that we know the true God. And we live as one with God because we are one with His Son— Christ Jesus. He's also the true God,\f + \fr 5:20 \fk true God \ft The New Testament acknowledges God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit— the Three-in-One, so Jesus is also worthy to be called God. See John 10:30; Rom. 9:5.\f* because He's always worthy to be believed, and is the source of eternal life.
\p
\v 21 My children whom I love, keep yourselves far away from all idols.
