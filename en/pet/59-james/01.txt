\v 1 My dear Brothers and Sisters in the faith, of the twelve tribes of God's people\f + \fr 1:1 \fk twelve tribes of God's people \ft With these words, James illustrates that all the followers of Jesus are like the twelve tribes of Israel that were scattered everywhere. The twelve tribes of Israel had scattered as a result of persecution, and it was the same with the followers of Jesus.\f* who are now scattered throughout the whole world:
\p Greetings from James, God's servant, and a servant of our Lord Christ Jesus.
\s Stand firm in the faith while praying to be given wisdom
\p
\v 2 Brothers and Sisters, every time your faith is tested through various troubles, you should consider it all as a blessing that brings joy to you.
\v 3 For you know that every time our faith is tested, it makes us more mature to endure in our faith.
\v 4 So may we be stronger to endure, so that we become more mature and more equipped, without lacking anything spiritually.
\p
\v 5 But in a test of faith, if you feel you lack wisdom, ask God for wisdom. For God is very generous to everyone, and He has never felt offended if we Him ask for it. For that reason ask, and the wisdom that you need will be given to you.
\v 6 But when you pray for it, believe completely, without doubting that God is ready to give the wisdom you need. For people who doubt are just like waves that are blown here and there by the wind.
\v 7-8 A person like that hasn't decided in his heart if he'll completely believe and rely on the Lord or not. He can't progress because his thoughts keep changing. So a person like that shouldn't expect that his prayer will be answered by the Lord!
\s High status that's real
\p
\v 9 Brothers and Sisters in the faith, if you're poor and have a low status, rejoice! For God has given you a high status— which is as citizens of His kingdom.
\v 10 Whereas, if you're rich or have a high status, rejoice if you're aware that your riches or your status are just temporary. For rich people are illustrated by wild flowers that quickly wilt and fall.
\v 11 For in the morning, when the sun gets higher and hotter, those plants become dry and the flowers fall off, and the beauty of the flowers disappears. The same thing will happen to the rich person. He'll die while he's still busy with all of his work.
\s Temptation isn't from God
\p
\v 12 Each of you who endures when your faith is tested by God through troubles should rejoice, because you'll be truly blessed by God! For after you've passed all of those tests, you'll be given a victory crown\f + \fr 1:12 \fk victory crown \ft The word translated ‘crown’ here doesn't mean a kings crown made of gold, but a wreath of an olive branch— like the sign of victory in athletic competitions of that age. Commentators have differing opinions as to whether ‘crown’ here is only an analogy that points to the gift of eternal life, or if God's people will truly receive crowns when they enter heaven. See also 2Tim. 4:8; 1Ptr. 5:4; Rev. 2:10.\f* when you enter heaven to live forever— according to God's promise to all of us who love Him.
\v 13 But if you feel tempted to sin, don't think that God is giving you that temptation. For God can't possibly be tempted to do evil, and He has never tempted anyone.
\v 14 But it's our own desires that tempt us, because we allow ourselves to be dragged away until we're ensnared by our own desires.
\v 15 Then each of our evil desires grows, so this can be illustrated as like a wild animal which is pregnant and will give birth. After growing, that desire will produce sin. Then that sin also grows until it finally produces death.
\p
\v 16 Brothers and Sisters whom I love, don't think the wrong way about this:
\v 17 God is the source of all good and perfect gifts. Every blessing comes down from God the Father, who created every object of light in the sky. But He isn't like the moon— whose light isn't constant and often changes.
\v 18 As an example of a perfect gift: God has chosen us to receive new birth through the true news of salvation from Him, so that we who believe in that news become special people owned by God.\f + \fr 1:18 \fk special people owned by God \ft Literally, “first fruits” or “the first produce (of the harvest).” In the Old Testament, this term was used for the produce of the harvest, like wheat and vegetables, that were given to God as an expression of thanks. And the same term was used for the first offspring of animals, or even the firstborn son of man. The first offspring of an animal was sacrificed to God, whereas other animals were offered in exchange for every firstborn son of the Jewish people. (See Ex. 22:29, Lev. 23:9-14, Deut. 26:1-11.)\f*
\s Become doers of God's Word, not just hearers
\p
\v 19 Brothers and Sisters whom I love, this is important! Each of us should always like to listen more than to speak. And don't get angry easily.
\v 20 For when we act in anger, we aren't following the will of God, for sure.
\v 21 For that reason, let's throw away everything that's still in our hearts that's dirty, unclean, or evil. Then with humble hearts, let's accept the true teaching that God plants in each of our hearts— which is His Word that has power to save us.
\p
\v 22 But we should become doers of His Word. Let's not deceive ourselves by thinking, “It's enough for me just to hear His Word.”
\v 23 For whoever just hears the teaching of God, but doesn't do it, is just like a person who looks closely at his own face in a mirror.
\v 24 But after looking closely at a bit of dirt on his cheek, he immediately goes and forgets to clean off the dirt!
\v 25 Whereas, whoever looks deeply into and meditates on the Law of the Lord which is perfect and gives freedom\f + \fr 1:25 \fk Law of the Lord … gives freedom \ft What James meant is explained in James 2:8-13. See also Gal. 1:1, 13-14; 6:2; Rom. 13:10;.\f* — and doesn't just hear it and quickly forget it, he's tbut becomes a doer of the Lord's Law, he's the one who'll be blessed by God in everything he does.
\p
\v 26 For the person who thinks that he has lived well according to the regulations of his religion, but doesn't control his own tongue, is a person who only pretends to be good, who has deceived himself. For being religious in that way is just useless.
\v 27 The way to be religious that's perfect and without fault in the eyes of God can be seen in this situation: When we pay attention to the suffering of orphans or widows, and help them, and when we don't let ourselves get stained by following worldly desires.
