\c 4
\s Don't have a divided heart, but humble yourself before God
\p
\v 1 Why do you fight and quarrel with each other?! Isn't it all caused by the desires of each of you that fight against each other to control yourself?
\v 2 You want something, but can't get it. Then you're jealous of your friend who has it, to the point that you're ready to do anything to get that thing— like fighting, quarreling, even murdering. This is the reason you can't get that thing: You forget to ask God for it in prayer!
\v 3 Or you've asked God for it over and over again, but He doesn't give you an answer. That happens because you ask for it for the wrong reasons— because you want to use for your own pleasure.
\p
\v 4 You're like a prostitute! A prostitute never wants to be faithful to one man, of course, and in the same way, you don't want to be faithful to God! You should know that if you're friends with this world, that means you're opposing God. I will repeat that again: You who want to be friends with this world have made yourselves God's enemies.
\v 5 Or maybe you consider the following verse in the Holy Bible to be just empty talk— huh? The verse I mean says,
\q “The Spirit of God, which was sent by God the Father to live in us, really longs jealously for us to be faithful to Him.\f + \fr 4:5 \fk Quote \ft The Greek language doesn't show if the “spirit” mentioned is the Spirit of God or the spirit of man. With the interpretation being 'spirit of man', James' quote can be translated, “The spirit that God puts into our bodies is full of envy.” And the problem is made more difficult because it's unclear what verse from the Old Testament James meant, but many commentators choose Ex. 20:3-5, 34:14.\f*
\m
\v 6 But the fact is, God's kindness to us is growing greater, like it's stated in the Holy Bible,
\q “God opposes people who are arrogant, but He's kind to people who are humble.”\x + Amos 3:34\x*
\p
\v 7 Because of that, obey God. Oppose the devil, and then he'll flee from you.
\v 8 Come near to God, then He'll come near to you. Hey, you sinners, don't longer use your hands to commit sin anymore! Purify your hearts again, as your hearts have become defiled because you haven't decided if you'll follow God or the direction of this world.
\v 9 Sincerely repent with sad hearts, regret and tears. Instead of having a good time and being joyful, it's better for you to mourn because of your spiritual condition.
\p
\v 10 Humble yourself before the Lord, and then He'll lift you up and help you.
\s You have no right to criticize your fellowman
\p
\v 11 Brothers and Sisters, don't slander each other, for if you criticize each other, you're raising yourself up as a judge. What I mean is that you obviously think you're so great— that you not only judge your fellowman, but you also say, “The Lord's Law needs to be changed.” It isn't your business to change the Lord's commands, but it's your duty to obey the Law of Love!
\v 12 There's just one Judge who has the right to determine the Law for us— that's God, not you! He's also the one who has authority to save or destroy. Because of that, you must not find fault with your fellowman anymore!
\s Honor God in your plans
\p
\v 13 Hey, you Brothers and Sisters who say, “Today or tomorrow we'll go to this certain city, then do business there for one year, and for sure we'll get lots of money,”—
\v 14 even though you don't know anything about your life tomorrow! Your life is just like smoke— it exists for a short time, and disappears a short time later.
\v 15 So it's better for you to talk like this: “If the Lord is willing, we'll live and do this or that.”
\v 16 But as in your previous plans, it's obvious that you're arrogant and rely on your own strength. All arrogance like that is wrong.
\p
\v 17 Whoever knows what's right to do, yet doesn't do it, is sinning.
