\s Guard your words
\p
\v 1 My Brothers and sisters, it would be best if not very many of you become teachers of the Lord's Word. For you know that God will judge the teachers of His Word by a higher standard.
\v 2 Each of us does many things wrong! But if someone has never said anything wrong, he's a perfect person. If he can do that, he's able to control his whole body.
\v 3 For example, we can control the whole body of a horse if we can control its mouth. That's why a bridle is put into a horse's mouth.
\v 4 It's the same with a ship. A ship is very huge, of course, and is carried along by a strong wind, but what controls the ship is a small rudder. And the person who holds the rudder determines where the ship goes.
\v 5 It's the same with our tongues, too. Even though the tongue is just a small part of our bodies, yet we can use that tongue to brag about ourselves and offend our brothers and sisters! Even though it's small, it can ruin many things— just like a huge forest can be burned up by a very small flame.
\v 6 It's certainly fitting to illustrate the tongue with fire! For it's as if all the evil in the world is kept in our tongues. And like poison, that evil spreads from there to destroy our whole bodies. Our tongues are like the flames of hell fire! What I mean is that it's as if the devil sets fires by using our tongues. Then like the illustration of a huge forest fire, our whole lives can be ruined by just the tongue.
\p
\v 7 Obviously, man can already tame almost every kind of animal, bird, crawling creature, and sea creature,
\v 8 but not one person is able to tame his own tongue. Our tongues are so wild and evil, like a snake that's full of deadly poison.
\v 9 Our tongues too quickly turn from praising God the Father, to cursing other people— even though those other people are those who were created by the Lord in His own image.
\v 10 It means that with these same mouths, we praise God and curse our fellowman. Brothers and sisters, don't be like that!
\v 11 Plain water and salt water can't come out of the same well— right!
\v 12 Also, my Brothers and Sisters, a fig tree can't produce olives. A grapevine can't produce figs. And plain water doesn't flow from a salt water well.
\s Wise character traits that are from God
\p
\v 13 Whoever feels he's smart and wise, let him show it through his good lifestyle and good deeds, which are done with humility. If you're wise, you'll be humble too.
\v 14 But if there's still jealousy, grudges, and selfishness in your heart, don't think, “I'm really wise,” because your thinking is very mistaken,
\v 15 and your wisdom isn't wisdom that comes from God. You only have worldly wisdom, that comes from your own personal desires and from evil spirits.
\v 16 For if you're still jealous and selfish, it means that you're still living a disorderly life, and you can only do what's evil.
\v 17 Whereas the true wisdom that comes from God leads us to live like this:
\q First of all holy, then peaceful with our fellowmen,
\q gentle, and open to following the will of other people.
\q Wisdom also guides us to feel compassion for our fellowmen
\q and continue to do good to them.
\q Wisdom from God is also always honest, and impartial.
\p
\v 18 The person who works to bring peace is truly blessed by God! He's the one who's really wise, and the result of that wisdom is obvious in a righteous life.
