\s Rich people are unfortunate
\p
\v 1 Hey, you rich people, how unfortunate you are!\f + \fr 5:1 \fk verses 1-6 \ft Many commentators say that in this section, James wrote about rich people in a way that imitates the writings of the Old Testament prophets— meaning that he wrote a harsh rebuke and told of God's judgment on people who weren't yet followers of Christ, and who weren't recipients of this letter. James wrote like that to comfort the poor people who received this letter, and as a warning to followers of Christ to use their wealth to help their fellow man. Compare with Is. 13:1-22 and Amos 1:3-2:3.\f* Cry and wail because God is ready to punish you with serious troubles!
\v 2 When God brings that punishment on you, it will be as if all of your riches have become garbage, and your beautiful clothing has been eaten by moths.
\v 3 Your treasures of gold and silver have no value anymore! In fact, those treasures have become proof in God's eyes that you aren't honest! You pile up treasures for yourself alone, without caring for your needy fellowman. So those treasures of yours will become like cancer that will destroy and burn up your body like fire.
\v 4 Proof of your dishonesty is obvious in the Lord's eyes, because the wages of people who had worked in your fields several months ago are still in your wallet. And now the complaints of those who've harvested the produce of your fields have been heard by the Lord Almighty.
\p
\v 5 For as long as you've lived in this world, you've have become used to your rich lifestyle and whatever you desire has to be fulfilled. So you've finally become fat like cattle that are ready to be butchered for a feast. The holiday for you to be butchered has arrived!
\v 6 God was watching when you used your power to repeatedly trample on the rights of people who weren't able to oppose you. It's as if you've killed them through your dishonesty! You are unfortunate!
\s Be patient and endure in faith
\p
\v 7 So Brothers and Sisters, because the Lord knows all of our troubles, be patient until the Lord Jesus returns. For example, think of the farmers who wait with such patience for the rain to fall, after the planting season, and before the harvest season.
\v 8 It's the same for each of you: Be patient and strengthen your hearts, because the Lord is coming soon.
\p
\v 9 Brothers and Sisters, none of us should be looking for and talking about the wrongs and weaknesses of our brothers and sisters. Look! Christ the just Judge is near, and He'll invoke a greater punishment on those who like to do things like that.\x + Mat. 7:1\x*
\p
\v 10 Brothers and Sisters, let's follow the example of the prophets who were sent by the Lord to tell His news to the Jewish forefathers. They remained patient, even though they were often persecuted and suffered so much.
\v 11 Remember that we really respect them now because they endured in suffering. Among them, Job is an example of a person who kept strong. And you know how God finally blessed him, because the Lord is full of compassion and kindness.
\s Respect God in words and promises
\p
\v 12 Brothers and Sisters, this is very important: When you say something or promise to do something, don't strengthen your words or your promise by swearing by any name. So don't call on heaven or earth as a witness to your vow. If what was said is true, it's enough to just say, “Yes, it's true.” If it's wrong, say, “It's not true.” For every time you say something with a vow, the Lord will judge you if what you've vowed isn't true.\x + Mat. 5:33-37\x*
\s Glorify God in every situation, and especially when sick
\p
\v 13 Whoever of us is suffering should pray. Whoever of us is joyful should sing to praise the Lord.
\v 14 Whoever of us is sick should call the elders of the church, so that they will pray for him and rub oil\f + \fr 5:14 \fk oil \ft The word that James wrote can be translated ‘oil’ or ‘olive oil’. In James' time, there weren't many types of oil, and olive oil was used to burn in lamps, cook food, as ointment for wounds, to rub on the head or body in preparation for a party, to anoint kings or prophets, and in this verse as a reminder of the elders' prayers and that God was present and working.\f* on him as a reminder that they've asked the Lord to heal him.
\v 15 And God will answer their prayer based on completely believing that the Lord is healing him.\x + Mat. 7:7-11, 21:22; James 1:6\x* The Lord will strengthen and heal him. And if his sickness is caused by his sins, by praying together, that person will be forgiven by the Lord.\f + \fr 5:15 \fk if his disease is caused by … \ft This verse can't be used to say that all diseases come as a result of the sin of the person suffering. Remember the stories of Job, and Paul in 2 Cor. 12:7-10. But this verse says ‘if’, because there are, of course, some diseases that are caused by our own sins.\f*
\v 16 That's why I urge each of us to admit our sins and weaknesses so that we can pray for each other. In that way, we'll be forgiven and healed, because the prayers of righteous people are very powerful and have a great affect.
\v 17 For example, Elijah was a normal person just like us. But he sincerely prayed that rain wouldn't fall, and obviously rain didn't fall on that land for three and a half years.
\v 18 Then when Elijah prayed again asking for rain, the rain fell, and the plants in the fields grew back.
\p
\v 19-20 Brothers and Sisters whom I love, remember this: If it's obvious that one of us has followed the wrong way, but another brother or sister guides him back to the true teaching and the right way of life, that brother or sister who had compassion on him and led him to return has saved him from hell, and opened the way for him so that his many sins and wrongs are forgiven.\x + Mat. 18:15; Gal. 6:1-2; 1 Pet. 4:8\x*
