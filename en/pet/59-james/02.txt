\s Have love and compassion for everyone without being partial because of their status
\p
\v 1 Brothers and Sisters, we who believe in our glorious Lord Christ Jesus can't be partial based on someone's status.
\v 2 For example, if two people come into your meeting— one of them is a rich person who wears really nice clothes and a large gold ring, whereas the second is a poor person who wears ugly clothes,
\v 3 it often happens that you'll pay special attention to the person whose clothes are really nice, and say to him or her, “Please sit in this nice place,” but you'll say to the poor person, “You stand over there” or, “Sit on the floor by my feet.”
\v 4 But by doing that, it's clear that you feel you're so great that you can distinguish between people, even though that's still based on worldly standards and evil thinking!
\p
\v 5 But just think, Brothers and Sisters whom I love! It turns out that God has chosen many people poor in material things to become spiritually rich! For they're blessed because they completely believe in Christ, and through believing they obtain the right to become citizens of God's kingdom— according to His promise to each of us who loves Him.
\v 6 Because of that, it isn't proper for us to consider anyone lowly! And have you forgotten that it's the rich people who are the very ones that always oppress us! They're the very ones who always drag us into court to take away our rights or our possessions.
\v 7 And they're the ones who like to sully the good name of Jesus , who made us His possessions.
\p
\v 8 But if each of you obeys the Law of Love given by our King, Jesus, you'll do what's right— which is the command written in the Holy Bible,
\q “Love your fellow man like you love yourself.”\x + Lev. 19:18\x*
\m
\v 9 But if you're partial because of a person's status, you're obviously sinning because you're breaking that Law of Love.
\p
\v 10 Remember that if a person could obey the whole Law, but then forgets one small regulation that's written in it, he has become a Law breaker and deserves to be punished by God. For the Law is considered to be a complete unit.
\v 11 For example, God ordered us in the Law, “Don't commit adultery” and “Don't murder.” So, if you don't commit adultery but you murder someone, you've become a Law breaker— not just a breaker of the law about murder.
\p
\v 12 For that reason, we should speak and carry out our lives as people whom Christ will judge according to His Law of Love— which is the Law that gives freedom.\f + \fr 2:12 \fk Law … freedom \ft See Jas. 1:25 and its footnote.\f*
\v 13 For on the Judgment Day, whoever hasn't shown compassion to his fellowman, won't be pitied by the Lord either. But if we become people who are compassionate, then we don't need to fear the Judgment Day!
\s Our faith is completed and proven through our good deeds
\p
\v 14 Brothers and Sisters, if one of us says, “I believe completely in Christ,” yet he doesn't do anything to show that he's a person who believes completely in Him, his words are just empty talk. We aren't saved based on talk like that alone!
\v 15 Think about this example: There's a brother or sister who needs clothing and food today.
\v 16 Then you, who have more than enough food and clothing, say to him, “Have a nice trip! May God give you clothes and food”— but you don't share anything with him, your words are just empty talk.
\v 17 It's the same in the matter of believing completely: If our faith isn't shown by deeds, then it doesn't mean a thing.
\p
\v 18 But there'll be someone who'll contradict me by saying, “But I'm not like you! I completely believe without having to prove it by deeds.” But I will answer that person, “How can I tell if you really have faith, or if it's just empty talk, if you never prove it? I'm certain it's much better for us to prove our faith in Christ through love in action!”
\v 19 For example, you say that you have faith because you're certain that there's only one God. Oh, you're so great! The demons also believe like you, and they tremble with fear because they already know that their ‘faith’ isn't able to save them from hell.
\v 20 Don't be so stupid! If you still need proof that faith which isn't shown through actions doesn't mean anything, think about this example:
\v 21 Certainly our forefather Abraham was accepted by God as a righteous person because of his actions— that is when God saw that Abraham was ready to sacrifice his son Isaac on the altar.
\v 22 So we can see that the faith and actions of Abraham worked together. My point is, your faith is completed because there are actions that prove it.
\v 23 That's what's meant by the verse in the Holy Bible which says,
\q “Abraham believed God's promise, and because of that he was accepted by God as a righteous man.”\x + Gen. 15:6; 2 Kings 20:7; Is. 41:8\x*
\m That's why the Holy Bible says he was a “Friend of God.”
\v 24 So it's clear that we need to be made right before God through our actions too— and not just because we believe.
\v 25 It was the same with Rahab— the prostitute who received the two spies sent by Joshua. Her faith became clear through her actions when she urged the two of them to go home by another road, and because of that, she was accepted as a righteous woman and was saved.\x + Josh. 2:1-21\x*
\p
\v 26 When someone doesn't breathe anymore, he's dead. It's the same if someone claims to fully believe completely in Christ but doesn't show his faith through good deeds. It's just empty talk!
