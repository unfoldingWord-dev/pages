\c 2
\p
\v 1 For that reason I've decided not to make your hearts sad anymore when I come back to visit you.
\v 2 For if I come and make your hearts sad, then I'll be even sadder, so who else will comfort me other than you whom I've made sad?!
\v 3 For that reason I wrote about this matter in my former letter, so that when I come, you won't make me sad. For you should be the source of my joy! And I'm sure, if I come you'll all be well, so I will rejoice, and you'll also feel joyful.
\v 4 So with a heavy and broken heart and also with tears continually falling I wrote my previous letter to you. I didn't mean to make you sad, but that you would know how great my love for you is.
\s Forgive the guilty person
\p
\v 5 Our brother's wrongdoing, which I spoke about in my letter, has disappointed all of you more than it did me. In order not to exaggerate the situation, there are some of you who only felt a little disappointed, but there are those who felt very disappointed.
\v 6 According to my advice, the punishment that has been given to him by most of you is enough.
\v 7 So now you should forgive and encourage our brother. That will help him not to drown in grief.
\v 8 For that reason, I ask you now to show him that you still love him.
\v 9 In that previous letter to you, the reason I wrote about this matter was to test you. I wanted to see if you would keep obeying even though you were experiencing a difficult matter.
\v 10 When you forgive that brother of ours, you should know that I've also forgiven him. It isn't certain yet that he has done anything wrong to me, but before Christ I truly forgive him, because that unifies all of us.
\v 11 Forgiving each other will be better for us, so that we aren't deceived by the devil. For we aren't stupid people who don't know the devil's plans!
\s Paulâ€™s concern in Troas
\p
\v 12 When I arrived in Troas, in order to tell the Good News about Christ, the Lord opened up a good opportunity for me.
\v 13 But I couldn't be calm there, because I didn't meet our brother Titus. So I said good-bye to the followers of Christ who were there, and went to Macedonia.
\s Victory through Christ
\p
\v 14 But thank God, for He's the one who always leads us, His servants, in victory through the power of Christ. God uses us to introduce Christ to everyone everywhere, so our ministry is like a fragrant odor of perfume that can be smelled everywhere.
\v 15 To God, our ministry is like an offering that smells fragrant, because we risk our lives to tell the news about His Son. And to those who are following the road of salvation, our ministry is also like a fragrant smell. But the reaction of those who are on the road to destruction is very different.
\v 16 To them, our ministry is like the very disgusting smell of a rotten carcass. But for people who are being saved, our ministry is like a fragrant smell from heaven that gives life. This is actually a very heavy responsibility for each of us who wants to serve Christ!
\v 17 Many false teachers make the news from God like goods that can be sold for personal profit. But we aren't like them! We know that God is the one who sent us, and that the ministry that we do is open before His eyes. For that reason we sincerely rely on Christ alone in telling the news of salvation from God.
