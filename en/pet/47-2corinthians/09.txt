\s Motivation to help brothers and sisters in the faith who don't have enough
\p
\v 1 In this letter, of course, I don't need to urge you to take part in this service to God’s people in Jerusalem,
\v 2 because I know that you're always prepared to give help. In fact, I motivated the churches in Macedonia by bragging about you. I told them that you, in the province of Achaia, have been ready to give a contribution since last year. And your zeal has moved most of their hearts to take part.
\v 3 But I'm sending those three brothers to you so that our story that brags about you won't be considered just empty talk. I want your contribution to really be ready— just like I've told them.
\v 4 For if there are brothers in the faith from Macedonia who come with me, and they see that you aren't ready yet, then we'll be ashamed! You'll be ashamed too, for sure, if what we bragged about you with confidence turns out to be empty talk.
\v 5 For that reason I'm urging those three brothers to go ahead of us. They'll help you prepare the contribution that you've promised, so that it will be ready when we arrive. That way, your contributions will truly be considered as voluntary gifts, and not forced.
\p
\v 6 Take note of this: The person who plants little will harvest little, and the person who plants a lot will harvest a lot!
\v 7 Each of you should give with willing hearts. Don't give with sad hearts or because of being forced, because God loves the person who gives with a happy heart.
\v 8 Remember that God is able to show His kindness to you in everything, so that your needs are always met— even more than enough! In that way, you'll be able to do good things even more.
\v 9 As the Holy Bible says,
\q1 “People whose lives are right are like farmers who scatter seeds.
\q2 They often give generously to poor people.
\q1 Their good deeds will never be forgotten by the Lord.”\x + Ps. 112:9\x*
\m
\v 10 So just like God provides seed for the one who plants, and gives us food to eat day by day, He'll also bless you abundantly in the same way. By that I mean, you'll be enabled to give generously to other people, and then your good deeds will produce much kindness before God.
\v 11 So you'll be made rich in everything, so that you're always able to give generously. And your gift through the contribution which we are collecting will make more and more people give thanks to God.
\p
\v 12 This service of ours doesn't just fulfill the needs of God’s people in Jerusalem, but it will make more and more people give thanks to God.
\v 13 Because of this service of yours, our brothers and sisters will praise God. For your generosity to them and to all people is what proves that you sincerely live according to the Good News about Christ.
\v 14 And when they pray, they'll pray for you full of love, because God obviously showed His kindness to you in a very amazing way.
\v 15 Thank God for the greatest gift that He's given to us— that is Christ Himself! The value of that greatest gift can't be explained with any words at all!
