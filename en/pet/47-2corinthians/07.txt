\c 7
\p
\v 1 My beloved Brothers and Sisters, because God has given such precious promises, then it is fitting for us to guard our bodies and spirits so that we're clean from everything that defiles. Fear and respect God! Because of that, let's be purified more and more to become more like God in His holiness.
\s Paul’s joy
\p
\v 2 I ask you to keep your hearts open to us! We've never done wrong to any of you, or led you astray, or used you to get money.
\v 3 I'm not saying that to show your faults. For like I've said, you've received a special place in our hearts! Even if we're far away from each other, you're always near to our hearts— to the extent that we're ready to die by persecution for you.
\v 4 I trust you very much and am proud of you, for you're the result of our ministry. And because of you, our joy is increased and we're encouraged more and more in all of our sufferings.
\p
\v 5 I say that because when we arrived in Macedonia, we couldn't be calm at all. Different kinds of suffering attacked us both from outside and inside of ourselves. From the outside we often encountered arguments, and inside, we were often afraid.
\v 6 But God, who always comforts His people who give up, encouraged our hearts when Titus came.
\v 7 Titus' arrival not only encouraged our hearts, but I was even more joyful when he said that you're longing to meet me again, and how you've been truly sorry for all the wrongs that happened, and that you're very happy to work with me again. On hearing all of that, my joy really increased.
\p
\v 8 Even though my previous letter made you sad, I don't regret writing it. Of course I know that letter made you sad, but that was only temporary.
\v 9 Now I rejoice– not because I made you sad. But I rejoice because your sorrow has made you repent. That means your sorrow was according to God's will. And that didn't make you give up, but made you stronger.
\v 10 For the sorrow that God desires makes us repent and leads us to salvation. And we no longer need to regret that sorrow, but we're thankful because we became closer to the Lord. But the sorrow which comes from the world just gives way to spiritual death.
\v 11 So now notice the results of sorrow that's according to God’s will: That is now
\q1 you follow the Lord's will more sincerely,
\q1 you've tried to prove that most of you weren't in the wrong,
\q1 you hate and fear committing sin more than ever,
\q1 you long for and have more zeal for what's right and just.
\q1 and you punished the guilty party.
\m So you've shown much proof that most of you aren't guilty in that matter.
\v 12 I want you to know that my reason for writing that letter wasn't to show who had done wrong to whom. But I wrote that letter to give you the opportunity before God to show how great your sincerity to follow us was.
\v 13 That's why when we heard the news from Titus, we were really encouraged.
\p And we didn't just feel encouraged, but we rejoiced even more because we saw Titus was so joyful, because all of you made his heart relieved and calm.
\v 14 Of course, before he visited you, I had told him many good things about you, the church of Corinth. And now I'm happy that Titus has proven true all of the praises that I had given. Just like I've always openly told the true teachings to you, so my praises of you that I told to Titus have proven true.
\v 15 And his love for you is growing deeper every time he remembers how you listened to him, and how you welcomed him with feelings of fear and respect.
\v 16 I rejoice because I can trust you in everything.
