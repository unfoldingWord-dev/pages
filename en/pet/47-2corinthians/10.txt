\s Paul defends his ministry
\p
\v 1 I Paul, have known that there are some of you who say that when I'm with you, I always have a humble attitude. But when I'm far away from you, I dare to write letters that contain harsh rebukes to you. For that reason, I ask you with the gentleness and humbleness of Christ
\v 2 that you not be influenced by people who think that I and my coworkers work in a worldly way. For when I come, I plan to confront them boldly. So I hope I don't need to use boldness like that with you!
\v 3 We don't fight in a worldly way— even though we still live in this world.
\v 4 For the weapons we use aren't worldy weapons, but spiritual weapons. The effectiveness of our weapons comes from God. That's why we can destroy all kinds of opposition and attacks of the enemy— who's the devil.\f + \fr 10:4 \fk opposition … \ft Literally, “strongholds.” This word is a figure of speech that illustrates the various kinds of opposition and attacks from all the authorities in the kingdom of darkness— which are very strong and organized by the devil.\f* So we snatch away people who've been taken captive by the devil and defeat the enemies' debates,
\v 5 and all human arrogance that are obstacles for humans themselves in knowing God. Like troops of soldiers who capture their enemies, we also defeat every thought that opposes the teaching about Christ, so that people are prepared to obey to Him.
\v 6 So when we come, we'll be ready to punish everyone who doesn't obey Christ. But before that, it would be best if you're the ones who begin to obey Him completely.
\p
\v 7 Most of you are just thinking of physical things and not aware of spiritual things! And in your midst there are those who brag about themselves as servants of Christ. They ought to be aware that we're also servants of Christ!
\v 8 If I'm considered to be too proud of the authority that God has given to us, I still don't feel guilty. For the Lord really has given us authority to build up your faith— not to destroy it.
\v 9-10 I say that because some have said, “Paul rebukes us sternly and with full authority in his letters. But when he's with us, he's weak and not skilled to preach at all.” If that's so, don't let any of you think that I'm only frightening you with what I've written!
\v 11 Let the person who thinks like that understand this: You'll notice the traits sterness and full authority when I come to visit you again— just like you've read in my letters!
\p
\v 12 People who oppose us brag about themselves saying that they're messengers of Christ too. But as Christ's messenger, I don't want to compare myself to them. They like to compare their special abilities with other people's special abilities— including us. They're proud of their own special abilities, but their behavior isn't very wise.\f + \fr 10:12 \fk Verse 12 \ft This verse literally says: Of course we don't dare to brag about ourselves or compare ourselves with people who think they have high standing. When they make a measuring standard for themselves, and they use their measuring standard to measure themselves and other people, that behavior of theirs is not very wise.\f*
\p
\v 13-14 I won't brag about myself in an unwise way, but it's proper for me to be proud because of the broad area of ministry which God has given us. For we were the first to tell the Good News about Christ to you, so your region is part of our area of ministry. So we aren't like people who want to steal a region of ministry from the person who started a particular region of ministry.
\v 15 If another apostle of Christ has opened a place of ministry, I don't brag about myself by saying: ”That region is my area of ministry.” But our hope is that your faith in Christ will continue to grow, so that our joint ministry will continually grow and expand more widely according to God's will.
\v 16 In that way, we can tell the Good News to people outside of your area. In the end, it'll become clear to everyone that we don't need to brag about the ministry which is done by Christ's other messengers.
\v 17 For the Holy Bible says, “The one who wants to express pride, must only take pride about what the Lord has done— and not take pride in himself!”\x + Jer. 9:24: 1 Cor. 1:31.\x*
\v 18 For the statement of the one who brags about himself saying, “I'm sent by Christ,” isn't definitely true yet. It's better for us to wait for when the Lord will show whose ministry was really pleasing to Him.
