\s Spiritual treasure in clay pots
\p
\v 1 God gave this task of ministry to us only because of His kindness. For that reason we never give up!
\v 2 We don't want to be involved anymore at all in the religious movement that's done in secret, and all of the characteristics of life that cause shame. We don't use cunning ways, and don't change the teaching of God to please men. Instead, we keep teaching true things openly. And in an open way, we want to show other people who we actually are. In that way, they can evaluate us before God, according to their consciences.
\v 3 If the Good News that we tell doesn't make sense for other people because their minds are as if still covered with a veil that was mentioned, it's clear that they're people who are headed for destruction.
\v 4 For the authority of this world\f + \fr 1:1 \fk authority of this world \ft Literally, “the god of this world”, meaning the devil.\f* has blinded the eyes of their hearts so they can't see the light of the glory that's in the Good News about Christ— where Christ truly is the image of God! That's why they don't believe in the Good News from God.
\p
\v 5 For the news that we announce isn't about ourselves! But what we announce is that Christ Jesus is Lord, and we are just lowly servants of yours because of Jesus' will.
\v 6 For it's God who has said, “Out of the darkness let light shine it's rays.” He's the one who shone His light into our hearts so that we could understand and see the glory of God that radiates from Christ's face.
\v 7 But that beautiful spiritual treasure has already been poured into us who are just like clay pots. In that way, it's clear that this amazing power comes from God— not from ourselves.
\p
\v 8 For that reason, even though we're often pressed from all directions, yet we aren't destroyed. Even though we often don't know the way out of the problems we face, yet we never give up!
\v 9 When we're persecuted, we're still certain that God will never leave us alone. And even though we're often beaten and repeatedly thrown down to the ground, God always helps us so we haven't died yet.
\v 10 So through the suffering we experience physically, we show that we're one with Jesus in His death. In that way, the power of Jesus' life is also seen in our bodies.
\v 11 Yes, of course we're still alive! But because we serve Jesus, our lives are always threatened. That happens to us so that the power of Jesus' life can also be seen in these perishable bodies of ours.
\v 12 So even though are lives are often threatened, it brings life to you!
\p
\v 13 It's written in the Holy Bible, “I believe, so I testify.”\x + Ps. 116:10.\x* We also have the same confidence:\f + \fr 4:13 \fk same confidence \ft Literally, “spirit of faith.” The word ‘spirit’ here does not mean the Holy Spirit, but means an attitude of mind.\f* We believe, so we testify.
\v 14 We're bold to testify because we know that God who made the Lord Jesus alive again from death will also make us alive again from death, so that we can live with Jesus. And in the end, all of us will stand before God.
\v 15 So everything that we experience happens for your good! God obviously desires us to suffer so that the news about His kindness is spread more and more widely to many people, so that abundant expressions of thanks are given to Him. In that way God is glorified more and more.
\s Life based on faith
\p
\v 16 For that reason, we don't give up! Even though physically we're becoming weaker and weaker, we keep being renewed spiritually every day!
\v 17 For all the suffering that we experience now is temporary and can actually be considered light. But paradoxically those sufferings are producing for us glory that will last forever and which can't be compared to anything! For that glory is so glorious, that all the persecutions and sufferings we experience don't need to be considered anymore!
\v 18 So we think about things that aren't seen now, and the things that are seen we do not think about. For what is seen is only temporary, but what isn't seen lasts forever.
