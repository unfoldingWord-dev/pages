\s Character traits of God’s servants
\p
\v 1 Regarding what I wrote above, don't think that we also brag about ourselves like those false teachers do. We aren't like those who need a letter of recommendation to introduce their ministry to a new church,
\v 2-3 because you're our letter of recommendation! For when people observe your way of life, you're like a letter of Christ's which can be known and read by everyone. That letter isn't written with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God. And that letter isn't engraved in stone,\f + \fr 3:2-3 \fk stone \ft Paul compares this with the Law which was given by God to Moses, which was written on stone tablets (Ex.24:12; 25:16).\f* but in your hearts. But because we're the ones who introduced Christ to you, the Lord also engraved your names in our hearts.
\v 4 We can talk like that because Christ is the one who gives us such confidence before God.
\v 5 I don't mean to say that we can serve God because of our own ability. No way! But God is the one who enables us to serve Him.
\v 6 For He's the one who enables us as servants to tell the news about a new promise with Him— which isn't based on written rules and laws, but on God's Spirit. Living out the old written rules and laws doesn't give us life, but brings us death, whereas God's Spirit brings us life.
\s The new promise is more glorious than the old promise
\p
\v 7 The old promise was, of course,\f + \fr 3:7 \fk promise \ft In verses 7-11 literally called, “Ministry.”\f* engraved in stone and accompanied by the glory of God. But even so, that promise brought us death. At the time that promise was given, the light of glory radiated from Moses' face, so that the Israelites couldn't keep looking at his face. But that light of glory was only temporary.
\v 8 So if the old promise was accompanied by glory, the glory of the new promise which comes from God's Spirit is certainly even more glorious!
\v 9 By that I mean: If the old promise had glory– which brought punishment to us, the glory from the new promise, which makes us righteous before God, is certainly even more glorious.
\v 10 Actually that old promise— which used to be considered glorious, isn't so glorious anymore when compared to the new promise now— which is far more glorious.
\v 11 For if the old promise– which has now been replaced by the new one, was given with glory, then the eternal promise must have more glorious glory, for sure.
\p
\v 12 Because we're so certain about what we hope for from God, we're very bold to tell about this new promise.
\v 13 We aren't like Moses who covered his face with a cloth so that the Israelites couldn't see the glorious light fading away.
\v 14 But the minds of the Israelite forefathers were closed. Even until now, when their children read the Old Testament, it's as if a veil still covers their minds so that they can't understand what it means. For that veil can only be removed when someone believes in Christ.
\v 15 But sadly, up to this day, when they read the Law of Moses, it's as if there's still a cloth covering their minds.
\v 16 However, when someone repents and follows the Lord, God will remove that veil from their minds.
\v 17 And the light of the glory that radiates to us from the Lord Jesus, illustrates the Holy Spirit. And where the Lord's Spirit is, there's freedom from the old rules and laws.
\v 18 So with faces that are no longer veiled, we all gaze on the Lord and reflect His glory. We become like mirrors! In that way the Lord Jesus— that is by His Spirit, changes us so that we become more perfect at reflecting His glory.
