\c 12
\s A special blessing in Paul’s life
\p
\v 1 I feel forced to brag about myself, even though it isn't useful. So I will continue to tell about the many visions and spiritual knowledge that the Lord revealed to me.
\v 2 There was a follower of Christ\f + \fr 12:2 \fk follower of Chirst \ft Paul really didn't want to brag about himself. That is why in 12:2-5 he told about his own experience, but he wrote it like it was someone else's experience.\f* whom I know, who was raised to the highest level of heaven fourteen years ago. I don't know if that person's body was really taken there, or just his spirit. Only God knows that.
\v 3-4 And I know that he was taken up to Paradise. Only God knows if his body was taken, or just his spirit. But he heard glorious things there! And mankind isn't permitted to tell about those things— and can't even explain them with human languages.
\v 5 I'm proud of what happened to that person, but I don't want to brag about myself in things like that. It's better just to brag about my weaknesses.
\p
\v 6 If I want to brag about myself because of amazing things like that, I won't brag about myself like those unwise teachers do, because I'm only saying what's true. But about such things I have no need to go into details, because I don't want you to evaluate me by things like that! But evaluate me by the actual deeds and by the teaching that you hear directly from me.
\p
\v 7 Yet, in order that I wouldn't be too proud of those amazing things that He revealed to me, I was given a disease that tortures my body.\f + \fr 12:7 \fk a disease that tortures my body \ft Literally, “a thorn in the flesh”.\f* Through that disease, God allows the devil to beat me, so that I don't brag about myself too much.
\v 8 I've asked the Lord to He heal me from that disease three times.
\v 9 But the Lord answered, “My kindness alone is enough for you! For My power is very obvious when you're weak.” So, it's far better for me to brag about my weaknesses, so that I feel the power of Christ protecting me.
\v 10 That's why I've learned as a messenger of Christ's to be happy when I experience weakness, insults, troubles, persecution, or suffering. For paradoxically just when I'm weak, that's the very time that I truly find strength!
\s Paul worries about the church in Corinth
\p
\v 11 Now I've spoken like a unwise person, but it was because of you that I bragged about myself like that. When other people insult me, you should be the ones who praise me, and not I myself. For I feel that I'm not at all inferior compared to those 'extraordinary apostles'— even though I'm actually a nobody.
\v 12 You yourselves have seen the proof that I'm an apostle, when you witnessed all kinds of miracles that I did among you through the Lord's power. And I did my tasks with complete patience.
\v 13 I served you and the other churches in the same way. There was only one difference: I never troubled you to pay me. If you feel that was wrong, forgive me!
\p
\v 14 Now I'm ready to visit you for the third time. And I won't trouble you for donations. For what I want isn't your wealth, but you yourselves— so that you're like my children. It isn't children who save wealth for their parents, of course, but it's the parents who save wealth for their children.
\v 15 So with a glad heart, I'm ready to give everything that I have for your sakes— even being ready to surrender myself for you. But if my love for you increases more and more, why does your love for me grow less and less?
\p
\v 16 But some of you may say, “Paul has never asked for donations from us to pay for his living expenses, of course, but he's tricky and has deceived us in order to gain a profit.”
\v 17 How's that possible! You yourselves know for sure that I've never used tricks to profit from you through the people whom I sent to you.
\v 18 For example, I've asked Titus to visit you, and I sent our brother in the faith with him. Titus didn't collect a donation from you – did he? You know, of course. that Titus and I work for the same goal\f + \fr 12:18 \fk goal \ft Literally, “spirit.” That word can mean the Holy Spirit, the human spirit, or “attitude.” Most interpreters say that here the meaning is “attitude/goal.”\f* and in the same way.
\p
\v 19 Now, while you've been reading this letter, were you thinking that we're trying to justify ourselves before you? That's not so! Brothers and Sisters whom we love, I promise by God and by our oneness in Christ that we're writing this just to encourage you.
\v 20 For I'm afraid that when I come, I will see that you aren't like I wanted, or that you'll see some trait in me that isn't what you hoped. So don't let any of you quarrel, be jealous, be angry, be divided, slander, gossip, be arrogant, or a group that causes disorder.
\v 21 When I come again, I don't want to be disappointed and feel ashamed before God because there are still those of you whose lives are inappropriate or improper for followers of Christ. If there are still those of you who haven't repented from old evil deeds— including sexual relations outside of marriage and all other sins of adultery, I will be very sad and weep because our ministry among you has obviously truly failed!
