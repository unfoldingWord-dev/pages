\c 13
\s Final warnings and greetings
\p
\v 1 Brothers and sisters, this visit to you will be my third one. And I'm ready to settle cases that are still among you. So I remind you of what's written in the Holy Bible, “Every case must be supported by two or three eyewitnesses, and only then can the decision about the case be official.”\x + Deut. 19:15\x*
\v 2 While we're still far apart, I feel it's necessary to repeat the warnings that I gave to all of you at the time of my second visit— especially to those who were living in sin at that time: That is, that on this next visit, whoever is still living in sin will not escape from the punishment that I will give according to what each has done!
\v 3 That means that you'll have the opportunity to witness the proof that you desire— which is that Christ speaks with full authority through me. Christ doesn't work weakly among you, of course, but He'll show His power in your lives.
\v 4 Christ appeared weak when He was crucified on the cross, of course, but now He lives through the power of God. We messengers of Christ also appear weak like Him. But because we're one with Christ, you'll witness that we act with the authority of God, for your good.
\p
\v 5 Test yourselves carefully. Examine yourselves to see if you sincerely believe in Christ, or not! Are you sure that Christ Jesus lives as one with you? Don't fail this test!
\v 6 And I hope, after testing yourselves, you'll realize that we also pass the test as apostles of Christ.
\v 7 We ask God that you not be hard-headed and keep doing wrong. You don't need to prove that we can use the authority of Christ. What's important is that you do what's right— even though people think we've failed because there wasn't an opportunity to show the authority we have as apostles of Christ.
\v 8 We can't act in a way that opposes true teaching. Our aim is to urge you to live according to the true teaching.
\v 9 We're happy if it's obvious that you already stand firm in oneness with the Lord when we arrive— even if we'll be considered weak because there's no opportunity to take harsh action against you. And we pray that your spiritual lives are more and more mature.
\v 10 That's why I'm writing this letter before I come to you, so that when I arrive, I won't need to use the authority that God has given me to inflict a harsh punishment. That authority was given to me to strengthen your faith— not to destroy you.
\p
\v 11 Finally Brothers and Sisters, rejoice. Each of you should work so that your spiritual lives become more and more mature. Accept all of my advice. You should live peacefully with one heart and mind. And I pray that God— that is He who always loves and gives calmness, will always be with you.
\v 12 And after you read this letter— as people who have been purified by God, you should greet each other full of love.\f + \fr 13:12 \fk purified … greet… full of love \ft Literally, “holy kiss.”\f* All of God's people who are here send greetings to you.
\p
\v 13 I pray that the kindness of the Lord Christ Jesus will always be in your lives, and that God keep's loving you, and that the Holy Spirit is with all of you, so that you remain one as brothers and sisters in the faith.
