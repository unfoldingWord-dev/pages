\c 6
\p
\v 1 So as messengers of God, we urge each of you: Don't make the news about God’s kindness that has been told to you worthless.
\v 2 For God says,
\q1 ”I've heard your request at exactly the right time,
\q2 and I've given help
\q2 to you on the day of salvation.”\x + Is. 49:8\x*
\m So we're telling each of you: Now is 'exactly the right time', and today is the 'day of salvation that's exactly right for you!
\p
\v 3 So we messengers of the Lord try not to make our way of life become an obstacle for other people to receive the news of salvation. For we don't want our ministry to be stained.
\v 4 Because of that, in every situation we try to show every person that we live properly as God’s servants— enduring in persecution, poverty, or trouble.
\v 5 We're often beaten and imprisoned. People get upset and attack us. We're forced to work hard to meet our basic needs. Our lives are often threatened so that we can't sleep at night and we don't have food.
\v 6 Even so, we keep trying to live with pure hearts, wisdom, patience and generosity. We depend on the Holy Spirit, and try to love everyone with sincere hearts.
\v 7 We always teach what's true, and rely on the power of God. We use all of the armor of spiritual warfare that's given to people whose lives are right— both to defend ourselves and to attack the authorities of darkness.
\p
\v 8 For there are people in our ministry who appreciate us, but there are also those who insult us. There are those who praise us, but there are also those who demean our good names. Even so we keep teaching what's true, yet there are still those who accuse us of being liars.
\v 9 Even though we're already well-known, we're treated like people who aren't known yet. It's as if we had already died, but look, we're still alive. We're often punished by beating, but don't die.
\v 10 Even though we often experience grief, yet we keep on rejoicing. We're very poor, but actually our ministry makes many people spiritually rich. We don't have anything, but we actually own everything.
\p
\v 11 By saying all those things, my beloved Brothers and Sisters in Corinth, we've spoken openly and our hearts are open to you as widely as possible.
\v 12 If there's something that hinders our relationship, it isn't we who don't love you enough! But are your hearts closed to us?
\v 13 So now I speak to you as children whom I love. So in response to our love, open up your hearts to us!
\s God’s people are like God's holy Temple
\p
\v 14 Let's not be bound with people who don't believe in Jesus, because a person who lives right can't work together with a person who doesn't live right. For example, the powers of darkness can't be one with the powers of light.
\v 15 Christ can't be on the same side as the devil!\f + \fr 6:15 \fk devil \ft Paul literally uses one of the devil’s names— which is “Belial.”\f* A person who believes in Christ can't be a close friend with a person who doesn't believe in Him.
\v 16 And it's really very improper to put idols in God's Temple. But for the living God, we are like God's Temple, because He lives among us— as God has said,
\q1 “I will live with them
\q2 and walk with them.
\q1 I will be their God,
\q2 and they'll be My people.”\x + Lev. 26:11-12\x*
\q1
\v 17 So, go out from among those evil people
\q2 and separate each of yourselves from them, says the Lord.
\q1 Don't touch their unclean things,
\q2 and then I will receive you.”\x + Is. 52:11\x*
\q1
\v 18 For the Lord Almighty says:
\q2 “I will be your Father,
\q2 and you'll be My sons and daughters.”\x + 2 Sam. 7:14; 7:8\x*
