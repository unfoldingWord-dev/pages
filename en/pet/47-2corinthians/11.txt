\c 11
\s Paul doesn't work like the false apostles
\p
\v 1 I beg you to be patient with me, because I want to write something that may seem a unwise. You've already been very patient to read this letter up to this point, of course!
\v 2 Before I tell you about that,,\f + \fr 11:2 \fk about that \ft Paul returns to the topic in 2 Kor.10:16.\f* I need to say that God wants me to guard you carefully so that you stay faithful to Christ. For Christ considers the whole unified church to be His future wife. So I've promised you to Christ, like a virgin is promised to her future husband. So I'm like the father who guards his unmarried daughter so that she stays faithful to her future husband until her wedding day.
\v 3 But I'm afraid that you might be deceived and your minds be led astray, and you'll leave your sincere and pure faithfulness to Christ— like Eve was deceived by the trickiness of the devil in the form of a snake.
\v 4 For it seems that you're very patient to hear every new teacher who comes bringing a teaching about Christ that's different than what we've taught you! And you're ready to accept teaching about the Holy Spirit and the Good News that's different from what we've given!
\p
\v 5 But I don't think I'm so inferior to those “extraordinary apostles”!
\v 6 It's true, I may not be a skilled preacher, but I'm not inferior in the area of knowledge. For in every way, I and my coworkers have proven that clearly to you.
\p
\v 7 Or am I considered at fault now because of telling you the Good News without being paid?! If so, please forgive me because I'm humbling myself for your sakes!
\v 8 At that time, I received donations from other churches. Maybe some think that I stole from them so that I could serve you.
\v 9 And when I was with you, if I had less than needed, I didn't burden any of you. For some brothers from Macedonia came to meet my needs. So I've watched myself so that I've never become a burden to you, and I will keep doing that.
\v 10 In fact, I promise by the true teaching from Christ that's within me: I will continue to carry out the decision not to receive donations from you. So none of you in Achaia can stop me from feeling proud because I don't receive donations from you.
\v 11 Why do I say that? Do you think that's a sign that I don't love you? No! God knows that I love you!
\p
\v 12 I will continue to carry out my decision not to receive donations from you, because I want to shut the mouths of those 'new apostles' who want to brag about themselves by saying that they work like we do.
\v 13 For they're false apostles, who work craftily and in disguise as Christ's apostles.
\v 14 And that's not surprising. For even the devil often disguises himself as a brighly shining angel so he can trick people in the garb of God's messenger.
\v 15 So it's not strange if the devil's servants make themselves look like God’s servants. In the end, they'll receive their reward according to what they've done!
\s Paul feels forced to tell about his suffering
\p
\v 16 So, don't think that I'm not very wise either,\f + \fr 12:16 \fk not very wise \ft Paul refers to what he said in chapter 10:12-14 and 11:1.\f* like those new teachers who like to brag about themselves! But if some of you still think I'm not very wise, accept me like you've accepted those new teachers, so that I can also brag about myself a little!
\v 17 (Of course I was just being sarcastic. Bragging about one's self doesn't actually agree with the Lord’s will. So let me brag about myself by imitating the words of those unwise people.)
\v 18 There are many teachers now who brag about themselves in a worldly way, so let me follow their example too.
\v 19 For you're very patient to listen to arrogant words from those stupid teachers! Wow! That's because you're so wise, of course!
\v 20 Because of that, you're patient, and just go along with it when those new teachers deceive you, take your possessions, and raise themselves above you by treating you like their 'yes-men'. In fact, you're too patient when they slap your faces!
\v 21 Of course, if Timothy and I are compared to teachers like that, we're clearly too weak! Do you think we should feel ashamed because we don't slap you?!
\p So, in the things that they dare to brag about themselves, I can also brag about myself in the same things. (But remember that I'm speaking like someone who's not very wise.)
\v 22 They're Hebrews– aren’t they? I'm a Hebrew too. Are they Israelites? I'm an Israelite too! Are they Abraham’s descendants? I'm also Abraham's descendant!
\v 23 And they brag about themselves because they serve Christ. I serve Christ more than they do! (What I just said is just what a drunk man would say!) I've worked hard, been imprisoned, and been beaten more than they have, and have almost died more often too.
\p
\v 24 The Jews have punished me five times by beating me thirty nine times— as is permitted according to the Law.
\v 25 And officials of the Roman government have sentenced me three times to be beaten with a wooden rod. I almost died once because I was stoned. I've experienced shipwrecks three times— including once when I was in the sea all night, until the next afternoon.
\v 26 On my trips, I've often been threatened by dangers from rivers, dangers from robbers, dangers from my own people, and dangers from non-Jews. It's the same whether I'm in a city, or in a lonely place, or at sea. And I'm also in danger when I'm with people who disguise themselves as brothers in the faith.
\p
\v 27 I've often worked and fought hard, and often don't sleep. I'm often hungry and thirsty, and I often endure hunger because there's no food. I'm often cold and don't have enough clothing.
\v 28 And besides all of that, I feel burdened everyday because of the struggles of all of the churches.
\v 29 So when I hear that there's a member of a church who feels weak, I feel weak too. Or if I hear that the devil has succeeded in making one of the members fall, I get very angry and my heart is broken.
\p
\v 30 Because I feel forced to brag about myself, it's better for me brag about things that show my weakness.
\v 31 In this example, I promise before God that I'm not lying. He's the Father of the Lord Jesus, and God should be praised forever!
\v 32 When I was in the city of Damascus, the governor who was appointed by King Aretas wanted to arrest me. So he put soldiers at all the city gates.
\v 33 But some friends put me in a big basket and lowered me through a high window in the city wall— so that I could run away from him.
