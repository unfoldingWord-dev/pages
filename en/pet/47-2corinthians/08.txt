\s How to give donations according to God's will
\p
\v 1 And now, Brothers and Sisters, we want you to know how God's kindness has worked in the hearts of our brothers and sisters of the churches in the province of Macedonia.
\v 2 They're being tested with much suffering, yet because of God's kindness, their joy increased so they gave contributions very generously. Even though they're very poor, yet they became rich in giving.
\v 3 I witnessed that they gave beyond their ability, so that they became even poorer. And they gave with willing hearts.
\v 4 In fact, they repeatedly asked us to allow them to take part in this glorious ministry to God’s people in Jerusalem too.
\v 5 And when we gave permission, they took part in a way that we didn't imagine— in which before they gave, they first surrendered themselves to the Lord, and then to us apostles of His. They did this amazing thing according to God's will!
\p
\v 6 For that reason we asked Titus to continue this ministry, because in the beginning he was the one who had started it, because of God's kindness.
\v 7 You've been very blessed in everything, so you increase abundantly in various special abilities given by God's Spirit:
\q1 You believe in Christ in a truly amazing way,
\q1 your abilities to speak are truly extraordinary,
\q1 and your wisdom is amazing.
\q1 Your zeal for the Lord is also extraordinary,
\q1 and your love for us is very deep.
\m Because of that, may your generosity in this opportunity also be more and more amazing!
\p
\v 8 I'm not writing a command. But because other churches have shown such amazing zeal in helping our brothers and sisters in the faith in Jerusalem, it's time for you to prove that you sincerely love our brothers and sisters too.
\v 9 For you already know the kindness of our Lord Christ Jesus: Even though He's very rich, yet in order to save us, He became poor— even becoming the poorest person, so that we might receive all spiritual riches!
\p
\v 10-11 So this is my advice about what's best for you in this service: Last year you were the first church which was willing to contribute something and to begin collecting donations. Because you've become an example for the other churches, it's best for you to finish the ministry that you've started. May each of you do that with willing hearts like at that time, and give whatever you can according to your ability.
\v 12 For if someone wants to help, then God will receive what that person gives according to his ability. For the Lord doesn't demand us to give beyond our ability.
\v 13 And of course we don't want you to have less than enough in order for other people to have more than enough. Not at all! We want each of our living needs to be equally met.
\v 14 At this time, you have more than enough and are able to help your brothers and sisters in the faith in Jerusalem who don't have enough. But there'll come a time later on when they'll have more than enough and you won't have enough, and they can meet your lack too. In that way, each of our needs will be equally met.
\v 15 So it can happen again like what's written in the Holy Bible,
\q1 “At that time, the people who gathered a lot of manna
\q2 didn't have too much,
\q1 and those who gathered just a little
\q2 didn't have too little.”\x + Ex. 16:18\x*
\s Regarding the ministry of Titus and his two friends
\p
\v 16 I thank God because He put a strong desire in Titus’s heart to help you— just like what's in my heart.
\v 17 For when we asked him to visit you again, he was very happy, because before we asked, he was already missing you and planning to go see you.
\v 18 We're also sending another brother in the faith with Titus— who's truly praised by all the churches because of his ministry in telling the Good News.
\v 19 Besides that, this brother was also chosen by the churches here to accompany us to bring the contributions to Jerusalem. We hope the contributions will glorify the Lord and will also prove that we sincerely want to help.
\v 20 So quite a few people will go with us to Jerusalem, so that no one will dare accuse us that we took part of that very large contribution for ourselves personally.
\v 21 For we're trying to do what's right— both before God and man.
\p
\v 22 Along with those two, we're also sending a brother in the faith who has proven many times that he's always ready to help. He's very ready to help again even now, because he really trusts you.
\p
\v 23 If someone asks about Titus, tell them he's my close friend who works with me in order to help you. And about the other brothers in the faith, they're sent by the churches here for the purpose of glorifying Christ.
\v 24 For that reason, you should show them that you sincerely love all of the brothers and sisters in the faith. In that way, the churches here will hear the testimony about you resulting in proof of why we always brag about you.
