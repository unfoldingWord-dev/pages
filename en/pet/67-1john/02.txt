\s Jesus our Advocate
\p
\v 1 My children whom I love, I'm writing this letter to you so that each of you won't commit sin. But if one of us does sin, we have an Advocate who defends us before the Father— that is Christ Jesus, who always does what's just.
\v 2 Jesus surrendered Himself as the peacemaking sacrifice which wipes out each of our sins, so that God isn't angry with us anymore. And His peacemaking sacrifice isn't just to forgive our sins, but His sacrifice is sufficient to forgive everyone in the world who believes in Him.\f + \fr 2:2 \fk forgive … \ft Literally, “forgive … everyone in the world.” If translated literally, readers could think that everyone in the world has been forgiven whether or not they've become followers of Christ. The TSI translates this according to John's emphasis in 1 John 5:9-13, John 3:16, and 1 John 3:23.\f*
\p
\v 3 And this is the sign that we truly know God— that we obey His commands.
\v 4 But if someone says, “I know God,” even though that person doesn't obey His commands, he's a liar. It's clear that the true teaching from God doesn't have a place in his heart yet.
\v 5 But if we obey God’s teachings more and more, it'll be more and more obvious that we love God perfectly. In that way we know that we're truly one with Him.\x + John 15:1-7; 1 John 4:13-17\x*
\v 6 If someone says that he lives in oneness with God, he should live like Christ Himself lived.
\s Love the brothers and sisters in the faith
\p
\v 7 Brothers and sisters whom I love, what I'm writing you now isn't a new command, but it's an old command. For the command that I'm stressing here is the teaching that we've all heard from the beginning.
\v 8 But what I'm writing to you can be called a new command, because it's truly obvious in the life of Christ and is obvious in all of our lives too. For that reason, it's clear that the darkness is disappearing, and the true light is now shining in our lives.
\p
\v 9 If one of us says, “I live in the light,” but he hates his brother in the faith, he is actually still living in the darkness.
\v 10 Whereas a person who loves his brother in the faith, lives in the light for sure. And a person like that won't make another person fall into sin.
\v 11 But a person who hates his brother in the faith is like a person who walks in the darkness and doesn't know where he's going. For the darkness has made him unable to see anything at all.
\q1
\v 12 To you— that is all my children,\f + \fr 2:12 \fk all my children \ft Here and in verse 14, literally “little children.” Most commentators say that, as in verse 2:1, John calls the whole church his children, because he's already old, and is also a leader.\f* I'm writing this letter to remind each of you
\q2 that your sins have been forgiven by God because of Christ
\q1
\v 13 To you who are already spiritually mature,\f + \fr 2:13 \fk spiritually mature \ft Here and in verse 14, literally “fathers.”\f* I'm writing this to remind you
\q2 that you've known God's Son— who existed from the beginning.
\q1 To you who aren't yet mature spiritually,\f + \fr 2:13 \fk not yet mature spiritually \ft Here and in verse 14, literally “young people.”\f* I'm writing to remind you
\q2 that you've overcome the evil one— the devil.
\q1
\v 14 So my children, the purpose of this letter is to remind you
\q2 that you already know God the Father.
\q1 And to you who are already spiritually mature, don't forget
\q2 that you've already known Him who has been from the beginning.
\q1 And to you who aren't yet spiritually mature, don't forget
\q2 that you're strong because God's Word lives in your hearts.
\q2 and in that way you've overcome the devil.
\p
\v 15 Let's not love the evil in this world, or anything at all that's in this world. If anyone loves worldly things, he doesn't love God the Father at all.
\v 16 For everything that comes from the world keeps us far from God. Worldly traits are all the evil desires that come from our bodies, the desire to possess what we see with our eyes, and the feeling of arrogance because of what we own. Those three traits don't come from God, but from this world.
\v 17 Remember that this world, and everything that's in it that people desire, are heading for destruction. But a person who does the will of God will continue to live forever.
\s Don't follow false teachers
\p
\v 18 My children, the end of the age is already near. You've heard that the antichrist\f + \fr 2:18 \fk antichrist \ft The antichrist was called “the king of evil” by the Apostle Paul in 2 Thes. 2:3-12.\f* will appear. So it's not surprising that now many false teachers have arisen who are actually messengers of the antichrist. From that we clearly know that we've already entered the end of the age.
\v 19 Those false teachers have masqueraded as our members, of course, but they weren't actually our members. If they had truly been our members, they would certainly have stayed with us. But when they left us, that proved that they weren't actually our members.
\p
\v 20 But we've received the anointing of the Holy Spirit which was given by the Most Holy One.\f + \fr 2:20 \fk The Most Holy One \ft Meaning God and also Christ, because the Two in One can be mentioned as giving God's Spirit. See Luke 24:49; John 14:16, 15:26, 16:7, 13-15; Acts 1:4.\f* And because of that, we can distinguish between true and false teaching.
\v 21 I'm not writing this to you because you don't know the true teaching, but because you really do know it. And you also know that there's no lie in that true teaching.
\p
\v 22 You'll know who's a false teacher by this: If a person says, “Jesus isn't the Christ,”\f + \fr 2:22 \fk Christ \ft is a word which comes from the Greek language, which means ‘anointed one’. In the Hebrew language, the same term is called ‘Messiah’. This term denotes a position, like the word ‘district head’ or ‘governor’. In Old Testament times, each king was anointed with olive oil by a prophet as the sign of being chosen and confirmed by God. And each priest and prophet of that time was also anointed. Jesus deserves to be called ‘the Anointed One’, because He holds the positions of prophet, High King, and our High Priest (Heb. 4-10). Because of some prophecies in the books of the prophets and in Psalms, at the time of Jesus, the Jewish people in general understood the meaning of ‘Christ’ as the King of Salvation whom God promised, who would come from the descendants of King David, and would free the people of Israel from its enemies, set up a government with the power of God, and rule with justice. (Is. 9:5-6 [Indonesian verse numbering]; Gen. 3:15; Deut. 18:18-19; Mic. 5:2; Zech. 12:10-14; Mal. 3:1, 4:5-6; Ps. 2, 16, 22, 40, 110)\f* it means that he's a messenger of the antichrist. And people like that also deny both God the Father and His Son.
\v 23 A person who doesn't admit that Jesus is God's Son, doesn't have a close relationship with God the Father. But a person who admits, “Jesus is God's Son,” has a close relationship with God the Father, and with His Son too.
\p
\v 24 For that reason, carefully keep the teaching in your hearts that you heard at the time you began to believe, so that you'll always be one with the Son, and with God His Father.
\v 25 And this is the promise that Jesus gave to us who are one with Him: We'll live forever.
\p
\v 26 I've written this because there are people who are trying to deceive you.
\v 27 But we've received the anointing of the Holy Spirit who's always in us. So we don't need to listen to any teacher who teaches outside of the Holy Spirit's teachings.\f + \fr 2:27 \fk any teacher … \ft Literally, “you don't need to be taught by anyone.” TSI translates this according to the interpretation that John uses the kind of figure of speech called 'hyperbole'— meaning that John exaggerates the actual meaning. All commentators say that John doesn't mean that God's people don't need to listen to teachings or sermons from pastors or church teachers. According to the theme of this chapter, John means that we we shouldn't listen to false teachers who bring teachings that aren't in agreement with what's taught by God's Spirit. See John 16:12-15\f* For His Spirit always teaches us everything that we need, and His teaching is always true, because He isn't a liar. So according to what was taught to us by His Spirit, keep one with Christ.
\p
\v 28 So now my children whom I love, keep one with Christ, so that when He returns, we'll welcome Him immediately without feeling afraid or ashamed.
\v 29 We know that Christ always does what's right. For that reason, we can recognize those who've received new birth from God the Father by observing that they keep doing what's right.
