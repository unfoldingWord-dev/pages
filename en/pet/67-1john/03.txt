\s We are God's children
\p
\v 1 Know this, God's love for us is so amazing, that we're called God's children! And we are His children, of course. But people in this world can't recognize our status as God's children, because they don't know Christ.\f + \fr 3:1 \fk Christ \ft Literally, “Him”— which can also be interpreted as 'God.'\f*
\v 2 Brothers and Sisters whom I love, we've now become God's children, but it isn't clear what our state will be like later. However, we know that when Christ returns, we'll become like Him, because we'll see Him in His true state.
\v 3 Everyone who hopes to see Christ, purifies himself, just as Christ is pure.
\p
\v 4 Everyone who sins breaks God’s Law, because breaking God’s Law is sin.
\v 5 And I want you to remember that Christ came to wipe out the sin of mankind, and there's no sin in Him.
\v 6 So everyone who's one with Christ won't keep on sinning. Everyone who keeps on sinning has never actually understood about Christ, and has never known Him.
\p
\v 7 Because of that, my children whom I love, don't let anyone deceive you that we who are one with Christ can commit sin. Christ lives rightly. And to become like Christ, we should do what's right.
\v 8 Whereas the devil has been sinning from the beginning. And the person who keeps sinning belongs to the devil. And the reason that the Son of God came into this world was to destroy all the works of the devil.
\p
\v 9 Whoever has received new birth from God the Father, has become a child of God! And each of His children can't possibly keep on sinning, because the new life given to him by God is within him. Each of us who has received new birth from God can't possibly keep sinning.
\v 10 In that way, the difference between us children of God and the children of the devil is obvious: The children of the devil don't do what's right and can't possibly love us who've become God's children.
\s We should love each other
\p
\v 11 This is the message that you've heard from the beginning: We should love each other.
\v 12 Let's not be like Cain, who was the son of the devil and killed his younger brother. And why did he kill his younger brother? Because Cain did what was evil, whereas his younger brother did what was right.
\p
\v 13 Brothers and Sisters, let's not be surprised when people in this world hate us.
\v 14 We're no longer included with those who are spiritually dead\x + Eph. 2:1-3; Col. 2:13-14\x* but are included with those who 've been made spiritually alive. We can know that because we love our brothers and sisters. If we don't love our brothers and sisters, then we're still spiritually dead.
\v 15 Everyone who hates his brother is actually a murderer. And we know for sure that a murderer hasn't been made spiritually alive, and because of that he doesn't have eternal life.
\p
\v 16 We know the meaning of love by this: Christ loved us to the extent that He sacrificed His life for us. So we should also be willing to sacrifice for our brothers and sisters.
\v 17 If one of us has enough earthly possessions and sees his brother suffering in need, yet he closes his heart's door to his brother, the birth from God which enables us to love our fellowman isn't in that person's heart.
\v 18 So my beloved bchildren, let's not just claim that we love our fellow man with our mouths, but we should sincerely love our fellowman with visible deeds.
\p
\v 19-20 Now, if we love our fellow man, it means that we may be certain that we're living according to the true teachings from God, and this will help us when we come to God in prayer. Sometimes we still feel guilty. But if we obviously love our fellow man, we can calm our hearts with the awareness that God is greater than our hearts, and He knows everything.
\v 21 Brothers and sisters whom I love, if our hearts don't feel guilty, we can come to God in prayer without feeling afraid,
\v 22 because it's obvious that we obey His commands and do what pleases His heart. When we make a request to Him in that condition, we'll receive answers to our prayers.
\v 23 And this is His command that I stress: We should believe in\f + \fr 3:23 \fk believe in \ft Literally, “believe in the name.” According to Jewish culture at the time of Jesus, 'name' meant the whole identity of Christ Jesus.\f* His Son, Christ Jesus and love each other— according to the command that Christ gave us.
\v 24 We who keep obeying God’s commands remain one with God, and God remains one with us. And this is how we know that we're still one with God: That is, if His Spirit which He gave us is still in us.
