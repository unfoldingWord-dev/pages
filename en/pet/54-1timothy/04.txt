\s Prophecy about false teachers
\p
\v 1 The Holy Spirit clearly says that in times to come, many people won't want to believe the true teaching any more. They'll follow evil spirits who lead astray, and believe various teachings of demons.
\v 2 Those teachings originate from liars who only pretend to be good people. Their consciences have hardened, so that they can't distinguish if what they do is right or wrong anymore.
\v 3 For example, they forbid us to marry or to eat certain foods, even though God is the one who created that food and prepares it for us who believe and have learned true teaching. The important thing is that we eat giving thanks,
\v 4 because everything God has created is good. Nothing is forbidden. By giving thanks we may eat and enjoy everything.
\v 5 So because of the Lord's Word, and in answer to our prayers, God makes all food permissible for us.
\s Become a good servant of Christ Jesus
\p
\v 6 Teach things like this to the brothers and sisters in the faith there, so that you'll be proven to be His good servant before our Lord Christ Jesus. A good servant of Christ must become more and more mature in all kinds of teachings that build up our beliefs— like the good teachings that you already follow.
\v 7 But don't get involved in teachings that are based on fables, because those kinds of teachings are always based just on worldly thinking, and are full of stupidity. It's better to keep training yourself spiritually so that you're more and more pleasing to God.
\v 8 Physical training is useful, of course, but limited, whereas living according to God's will is always far more useful, because it brings blessings for this present life and for that which will come.
\v 9 That teaching has been proven to be true and is worthy to be believed completely.
\v 10 For we put our hope in the living God. He's also the Savior of everyone— that is for those who believe in Him. For that reason, we keep fighting and working hard.
\p
\v 11 Advise and teach the church of the Lord that you serve to do the things that were mentioned.
\v 12 Even though you're still young, don't let anyone look down on you. For that reason, you should become an example for believers through the way you speak, by your lifestyle, your love, your faith in Christ, and by your holy life.
\v 13 Before I come, put these things first in your ministry: Read and teach the Holy Bible to the church, and urge them to do it.
\v 14 Always remember to use and develop the special ability that was given to you through prophecy— that is when the elders of the church laid their hands on you.
\v 15 Keep on doing these tasks with all your heart, so that your faith and ministry clearly grow more and more in everyone's sight.
\v 16 Guard yourself, and pay full attention to the things you teach! Stand firm in those things, so that you'll save yourself and the people who hear your teaching.
