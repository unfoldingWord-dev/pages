\s The way to lead the church based on age
\p
\v 1 Don't harshly rebuke a brother in the faith who's older than you, but give advice to him with full respect, as if he's your own father. And advise a brother in the faith who's younger than you as if he's your own younger brother.
\v 2 In the same way, give advice to a sister in the faith who's older than you with full respect, as if she's your own mother. And with a sincere heart, advise a sister in the faith who is younger than you, as if advising your own younger sister.
\s How the church should pay attention to the needs of widows
\p
\v 3 Pay respectful attention to the needs of widows\f + \fr 5:3 \fk widows \ft A widow here is a widow whose husband has died, not because of divorce.\f* who don't have family that can help them.
\v 4 But if a widow has children or grandchildren, her descendants should first learn to serve God by paying attention to the needs of their own parent or grandmother. In that way, each of those children or grandchildren may repay the goodness of his or her parent, or grandmother, because that pleases God.
\v 5 But the church should pay attention to the needs of the widows who really live alone and have no one who can help them, because they always hope in God completely, and pray day and night asking for His help for themselves and for our other brothers and sisters.
\v 6 But every widow who lives just to enjoy worldly pleasures alone is actually already spiritually dead, even though she's still alive.
\v 7 Tell these things to the brothers and sisters in the faith there, so that they arrange to serve the widows well. In that way, the church's way of life won't be marred before people who don't yet believe in Christ.
\v 8 And vice versa, if a member of the church doesn't take care of his or her family, especially immediate family, it means that he doesn't really believe and follow our teaching, and before God he's worse than people who don't yet believe in Christ.
\p
\v 9 Only put women who are sixty years of age or older on the list of widows, who were previously known as wives who were faithful to their husbands.
\v 10 Every widow who's put on the list should be known through her actions as a good woman— for example she raised her children well, likes to give lodging, is willing to be a servant to the brothers and sisters in the faith, likes to help people who experience trouble, and is always involved in all kinds of good deeds.
\p
\v 11 But widows who're younger than sixty years may not be put on the list, because if at some time they desire to find a husband, that desire will make them easily forget their promise— that is their promise to serve only Christ.
\v 12 So don't put young widows on the list, so that they don't fall under God’s punishment because they break their promise to serve only Christ.
\v 13 Also, young widows often become lazy. And what's worse, they like to waste time by visiting people’s houses, like to slander other people, like meddling in other people’s affairs, and like talking about things that aren't proper.
\v 14 So I want young widows to marry again, raise children, and take care of their households. In that way, people who oppose us won't have a reason to speak badly about us anymore.
\v 15 For it has happened that some young widows have gone astray and become servants of the devil.
\p
\v 16 The needs of widows should be looked after by their family members in the church, so that the church no longer needs to be bothered with taking care of them, and can take care of other widows who live alone without a family.
\s Some instructions for Timothy
\p
\v 17 The elders who lead the church well deserve to be appreciated in two ways— that is respect them, and also give them an appropriate wage, especially those elders who have the responsibility for preaching and teaching.
\v 18 For there are two verses in the Holy Bible. The first,
\q1 “Don't tie the mouth shut of the ox that works to trample wheat to loosen grains from their stalks. Allow the ox to eat while it works.”\x + Deut. 25:4; Lev. 19:13, 1 Cor 9:7-9\x*
\q1 The second, “The worker has a right to receive his wages.”\x + Lev. 19:13; Deut. 24:14-15; Mat. 10:10; Luke 10:7; 1 Cor. 9:14\x*
\p
\v 19 Don't listen to accusations about the wrong doings of an elder unless there are two or more eye witnesses who substantiate that accusation.
\v 20 If it's proven that an elder is living in sin, rebuke him in front of the whole church, so that everyone else will be afraid to do wrong like that person did.
\p
\v 21 Before God, and Christ Jesus, and the heavenly angels, I command you to follow all of these instructions. And do all of this for every member of the church, without being partial, and without taking sides with anyone.
\p
\v 22 Before a candidate for elder is proven to be a good person, don't lay your hands on that person to officially appoint him as an elder. Don't let other people accuse you of being involved in his sins. Always watch yourself so that you stay pure and aren't stained.
\p
\v 23-25 The sins that some people commit are quickly known and become obvious before they're examined. But the sins of some other people are hidden and will only become obvious in days to come. In the same way, the good deeds we do are usually quickly known, but those that aren't quickly known can't possibly remain hidden forever.
\p I also advise you: Besides drinking ordinary water, drink a little wine as a medicine too, so that you don't often have a stomachache.
