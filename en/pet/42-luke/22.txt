\s The Jewish leaders plan to kill Jesus
\r (Matt.26:1-5, 14-16; Mark 14:1-2, 10-11; John 11:45-53)
\p
\v 1 When the Passover Celebration\f + \fr 22:1 \fk Passover Celebration \ft Literally, “Celebration of Unleavened Bread” in which these words translate just one word in the Greek language. The Celebration of Unleavened Bread begins on the Day of Passover and continues for eight days— which includes two Sabbath days. The two celebrations were combined. See Ex.12 and the note in Luke 22:16.\f* was near,
\v 2 the chief priests and Law experts secretly looked for a way to kill Jesus without the crowd knowing it. They were afraid of the crowd, because the crowd, who liked Jesus, might take direct action against them.
\s Judas sells Jesus
\p
\v 3 Then the devil took control of Judas' heart— the one from the village of Kariot, who was one of the twelve disciples of Jesus.
\v 4 Because of that, he met with the chief priests and the head guards of God's Temple to talk about how to hand Jesus over to them.
\v 5 They were very happy to hear that, so they agreed to give a sum of money to him.
\v 6 Judas agreed and looked for a good opportunity to turn Jesus over to them— without the crowd knowing it.
\s Passover preparations
\r (Matt.26:17-25; Mark 14:12-21; John 13:21-30)
\p
\v 7 Then the first day of the Celebration of Passover came—\f + \fr 22:7 \fk Passover \ft Literally, the “Celebration of Unleavened Bread.” See note in Luke 22:1\f* which was the day when all the Passover lambs were killed.
\v 8 So Jesus told Peter and John, “Go and prepare the food for the Passover dinner for us.”
\p
\v 9 And they asked, “Where do you want us to prepare it, Sir?”
\p
\v 10 Jesus answered, “As soon as you enter Jerusalem, you'll meet a male slave who's carrying a jug filled with water. Follow him until you reach the house he enters.
\v 11 Then say to the owner of that house, ‘Sir, our Teacher asks you: Where's there a place for Me and My disciples to eat the Passover meal?’
\v 12 Then that person will show you a large room on the upper floor, which is already complete with a table and other furnishings. Prepare the Passover meal for us there.”
\p
\v 13 So Peter and John went to Jerusalem, and they found it to be just like Jesus had told them. Then they prepared the Passover meal there.
\s Jesus gives a meal to remember His body and blood
\r (Matt.26:21-30; Mark 14:18-26; John 13:21-26; 1 Cor.11:23-25)
\p
\v 14 When the time came, Jesus and His disciples— who were also called His apostles, sat together to celebrate the Passover meal.
\v 15 He said to them, “I've really longed for us to celebrate this Passover meal together before the time comes for Me to face My suffering.
\v 16 For that reason, I'm telling you sincerely that I won't eat the Passover meal again until the meaning of this celebration becomes reality in God's kingdom.”\f + \fr 22:16 \fk Passover … becomes reality in God's kingdom \ft Passover in the Hebrew language means “pass by.” At the celebration of Passover, the Jews remembered when the angel of punishment passed by the houses of the tribe of Israel and entered each of the houses of the Egyptians to kill each of their oldest children. After seeing that final terrifying miracle, the king of Egypt ordered the people of Israel out of Egypt. (Ex.12:1-51) On the night of the first Passover Celebration in Egypt, the people of Israel had made marks by smearing the blood of a lamb on the doors of each of their houses. Jesus is like the Passover lamb for us. Just as the angel of punishment passed over the houses of the people of Israel in Egypt, in the same way we're also saved from God's punishment as a result of our sins because of the blood of Jesus. When the people of Israel ate the Passover lamb, according to the regulations of Moses, the bones of the lamb couldn't be broken. The writers of the Gospels wrote that the bones of Jesus were not broken either, while He was still on the cross. So now the Passover Day illustrates our salvation through the sacrifice of Christ and the kindness of God. And at the feast which will be held at the beginning of God's kingdom, the meaning of Passover Day will become a reality.\f*
\p
\v 17 Then He took the cup full of wine and gave thanks to God for it. Then He said, “Take this and share it among yourselves.
\v 18 For I'm telling you sincerely that after this, I won't drink wine again until God establishes His kingdom in reality on earth.”
\p
\v 19 So He took the bread and gave thanks to God for the bread. Then He tore the bread into pieces and gave it to His disciples while saying, “This is My body which has been sacrificed to God for you. Do this to remember Me.”
\p
\v 20 After they ate, Jesus did the same thing with the cup filled with wine. While giving it to them He said, “This wine reveals the new promise between God and man— in which the blood of My death which is poured out for you becomes a sign that the promise is official.
\p
\v 21 “But pay attention! The man who's turning Me over to the people who oppose me, is now sitting at this table with Me.
\v 22 I— as the Son of Man, will die, of course, like what has been determined by God, but the man who turns Me over to those who oppose Me is unfortunate!”
\p
\v 23 Then His disciples were very angry and began to ask each other, “Which one of us has the heart to do that?!”
\s Leaders should be like servants
\p
\v 24 Then they argued with each other about who was the number one disciple among them.
\v 25 Because of that, Jesus said to them, “In this world, all of the kings and other rulers are happy to oppress and enslave their citizens. And even though a king oppresses his citizens, his citizens must always call him ‘the peoples' helper.’
\v 26 But you must not be like that. Whoever wants to be number one among you, let him become like the lowliest person. And whoever wants to be a leader among you should become like a servant.
\v 27 Think about this example: There are two people in a room. The first person is serving food to the second person who's at the table. Of the two of them, who is more important? The one sitting at the table— right?! But remember My example among you: I've done everything like a servant.
\p
\v 28 You're the ones who've stood firmly with Me in all the troubles that I've experienced.
\v 29 Because of that, I will give authority to you to rule with Me in the kingdom given to Me by My Father.
\v 30 So you'll eat and drink with Me in My kingdom, and each of you will sit on a throne to rule with Me over the twelve tribes of Israel.”\f + \fr 22:30 \fk rule … twelve tribes of Israel \ft Literally, “judge the twelve tribes of Israel.” It's most likely that the meaning of the “twelve tribes of Israel” here includes all of God's people who enter God's kingdom— meaning people from every people group. (Gal. 3:26-29, 6:16; Luke 13:29) In the same way, it's most likely that 'judge' in this verse means more than just settling cases, but ruling with Christ in God's kingdom.\f*
\s Peter will deny Jesus
\r (Matt.26:31-35; Mark 14:27-31; John 13:36-38)
\p
\v 31 Then Jesus said, “Simon, Simon, listen well! The devil has asked permission from God to test all of you like a farmer separates the wheat from the chaff.
\v 32 But I've prayed for you, Simon, so that you keep believing in Me. And after that test— when you've returned to believing in Me, you should encourage the faith of your brothers and sisters.”
\p
\v 33 Then Peter said to Him, “But Lord, I'll keep following You— even if I enter prison or am killed with You.”
\p
\v 34 But Jesus said, “Peter, I'm telling you sincerely that early in the morning before the rooster crows, you'll already have denied Me three times.”
\s Be ready to face troubles
\p
\v 35 Then Jesus said to His disciples, “Try to remember back to when I sent you to tell the Good News without taking a purse of money, a bag, or shoes. Did you experience any lack?”
\p They answered, “No.”
\p
\v 36 Then He said to them, “But now, if you each have a purse of money or a bag, you should bring it. And if you don't have a sword, you should buy one— even if you have to sell your robe in order to own one.
\v 37 For I'm telling you sincerely that right now the prophecies about Me are being fulfilled. Everything must happen according to what has been prophesied about Me— including this prophecy:
\q1 ‘He'll be treated like a criminal.’”\x + Is.53:12\x*
\p
\v 38 Then they said, “Oh Lord, look! Here are two swords.”
\p So He said, “That's enough.”
\s Jesus prays alone in the garden of Gethsemane
\r (Matt.26:36-46; Mark 14:32-42)
\p
\v 39 Then as was Jesus' custom, He and His disciples left Jerusalem and went to the Mount of Olives.
\v 40 After arriving in that place, He ordered them to, “Pray so that none of you commits sin when tempted by the devil.”
\p
\v 41 Then Jesus went a little farther from them, approximately thirty meters. There He knelt down to pray, saying,
\v 42 “Oh Father! I beg, if You want Father, don't let Me undergo this suffering!\f + \fr 22:42 \fk don't … undergo this suffering \ft Literally, “put this cup far from Me.”\f* But don't let it happen according to My will, instead Your will alone be done.”
\v 43 [Then an angel showed himself to Jesus and strengthened Him so that He could face the suffering that He would soon experience.
\v 44 Because of the weight of that suffering, Jesus prayed even more sincerely, until His sweat was like drops of blood that dripped to the ground. ]\f + \fr 22:43-44 \fk Verses 43-44 \ft These two verses aren't found in some of the oldest copies.\f*
\v 45 After He finished praying, He stood up and returned to His disciples and found them sleeping. They were very sad, so it was hard for them to keep their eyes open.
\v 46 Then He said to them, “Why're you sleeping?! Wake up and pray so that none of you commits sin when tempted by the devil.”
\s Jesus is arrested
\r (Matt.26:47-56; Mark 14:43-50; John 18:3-11)
\p
\v 47 While Jesus was still speaking, a crowd came, and Judas— one of His twelve disciples, walked in front of them as their guide. He came close to Jesus and hugged Him.\f + \fr 22:47 \fk hugged \ft Here and in the following verses, in a literal way, “kissed.” This was a normal way to greet friends among the Jews.\f*
\p
\v 48 But Jesus said to him, “Judas! Why are You betraying Me with your hug!”
\v 49 When the other disciples saw what was happening, they said, “Lord, we're ready to oppose them with swords!”
\v 50 Then one of the disciples attacked a slave of the high priest with a sword. But he only succeeded in cutting off his right ear.\x + John 18:10\x*
\p
\v 51 But Jesus said, “Stop it!” Then Jesus touched the ear of the man and healed it.
\p
\v 52 Then Jesus said to the chief priests, the head guards of the temple, and the Jewish leaders who came to arrest Him, “You think I'm an evil person— huh!— so you have to bring swords and clubs here!
\v 53 However, I was there among you everyday in the courtyard of God's Temple. Why weren't you bold enough to arrest Me there?! But of course the time of darkness agrees with you, because you carry out the desires of the powers of darkness.”
\s Peter says that he doesn't know Jesus
\r (Matt.26:57-58, 69-75; Mark 14:53-54, 66-72; John 18:12-18, 25-27)
\p
\v 54 After they arrested Jesus, they took Him to the house of the high priest, while Peter followed them from a distance.
\v 55 People had lit a fire in the middle of the yard of that house, and they were sitting, warming themselves around it. So Peter also sat among them there.
\v 56 A woman helper saw Peter sitting near the fire. She looked at Peter and said, “This man is also a follower of Jesus.”
\p
\v 57 But Peter denied it, saying, “Ma'am, I don't know that man.”
\v 58 Not long after that, a man saw Peter and said, “You're a follower of that man too.”
\p But Peter said, “That's not so, Sir!”
\p
\v 59 About one hour later, another person said with certainty, “This man really is a follower of Jesus, because he's also a Galilean.”
\p
\v 60 But Peter said, “Sir, I don't understand what you mean.” That very moment— while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed.
\v 61 Then the Lord Jesus turned and looked at Peter. So he remembered what the Lord said to him, “Early in the morning, before the rooster crows, you'll have denied Me three times.”
\v 62 Then Peter went out of the yard of that house and wept with great sadness.
\s The guards of the temple make fun of Jesus
\r (Matt.26:67-68; Mark 14:65)
\p
\v 63 Then the guards of God's Temple, who were detaining Jesus, made fun of Him by insulting and hitting Him.
\v 64 They covered His face with a cloth and repeatedly said, “If you're really a prophet, tell who hit you.”
\v 65 And there were many other words they said to insult Him.
\s Jesus is brought to face the council of the Jewish Religious Court
\r (Matt. 26:57-58, 69-75; Mark 14:53-54, 66-72; John 18:12-18, 25-27)
\p
\v 66 In the morning, the members of the Religious Court gathered— including the Jewish leaders, chief priests, and Law experts. Then Jesus was brought before them.
\p
\v 67 They said, “Tell us: Is it true that you're the Christ?”\f + \fr 22:67 \fk Christ \ft is not a name, but a specific position that means King of Salvation. See the note in Luke 2:11.\f*
\p Then Jesus answered, “If I say that I'm the Christ, you won't believe Me.
\v 68 And if I ask you something, you won't answer Me either.
\v 69 But it won't be long, and the Son of Man— who I am, will sit in the place of highest honor beside God Almighty— that is at His right side.”\x + Ps. 110:1\x*
\p
\v 70 Then they all said, “If that's so, are you really God's Son?”
\p Jesus answered them, “It's as you say.”
\p
\v 71 Then they all said, “We don't need to find any other witnesses, because he himself has just now admitted it, and we heard it directly for ourselves!”
