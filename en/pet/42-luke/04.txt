\s Jesus is tested by the devil
\r (Mat. 4:1-11; Mark 1:12-13)
\p
\v 1 When Jesus left the Jordan River, God's Spirit had filled Him. And God's Spirit led Him to go and stay in the desert.
\v 2 Jesus was tested there by the devil for forty days. All that time He didn't eat at all, and after that He was very hungry.
\v 3 Then the devil said to Him, “You're God's Son\f + \fr 4:3 \fk God's Son \ft Before Jesus was born on this earth, God had announced in Ps.2:7, “You're My Son. Today I proclaim that I'm Your Father.” The writer of Hebrews in the New Testament states (in Heb. 1:5) that this verse is about Jesus. And before Jesus' birth, the angel Gabriel announced to Mary (in Luke 1:35), “The Holy Spirit will come to you, and the power of the Most High will come upon you, so that the holy Child whom you give birth to will be called God's Son.” So God Himself is the one who announced that Jesus was His Son before He was born on this earth, and we call Him 'God's Son' in agreement with God's Word. And from Luke 1:35, it's clear that Mary conceived Jesus, not because of a sexual relationship with God or man, but because of the power of the Holy Spirit.(John 4:24).\f*— right?! Make this rock become bread!”
\p
\v 4 Jesus answered, “It's written in the Holy Bible,
\q1 ‘The man's life doesn't depend on just bread.’”\x + Num. 8:3\x*
\p
\v 5 Then in an amazing way, the devil took Jesus to a high place, and in the blink of an eye he showed Him all the kingdoms that are in the world.
\v 6 The devil said to Him, “I will give all of the authority and glory of this to you. For it was all given to me, and I can give it to anyone that I want to.
\v 7 So, if you\f + \fr 4:7 \fk you \ft Even though the devil knew that Jesus was God's Son, 'you' uses a small letter because the devil didn't respect Him as he should have.\f* kneel and worship me now, all of this will become Your possession.”
\v 8 Jesus answered him, “It's written in the Holy Bible,
\q1 ‘Worship the Lord your God,
\q2 and He's the only one you must serve.’”\x + Num. 6:13\x*
\p
\v 9 Then in just a short time, the devil carried Jesus to Jerusalem and put Him on the highest point of God's Temple. He said, “If you really are God's Son, jump down!
\v 10 For it's written in the Holy Bible,
\q1 ‘God will order the angels to guard you.’\x + Ps. 91:11\x*
\m
\v 11 And it also says,
\q1 ‘They'll catch you in their hands
\q2 so that your foot won't get cut from hitting a stone.’”\x + Ps. 91:12\x*
\p
\v 12 But Jesus answered him, “It's also written in the Holy Bible,
\q1 ‘Don't intentionally test the Lord your God by doing something that opposes His will.’”\x + Num. 6:16\x*
\m
\v 13 After Jesus was tested in various ways like that, the devil went and left Him. But the devil was looking for another opportunity to test Him.
\s Jesus teaches the crowd
\r (Mat. 4:12-17; Mark 1:14-15)
\p
\v 14 Then Jesus returned to Galilee. He was full of the Holy Spirit's power, and news about Him spread to that whole region.
\v 15 He taught in the Jewish synagogues\f + \fr 4:15 \fk Jewish synagogues \ft In New Testament times, the synagogues were used as general meeting places for the local Jewish people, and also used as places for the Jewish people to pray and study God's Word. The synagogues were different from God's Temple— which was in the city of Jerusalem. Burned sacrifices were only done at God's Temple, whereas synagogues were built in every city and village where the Jews lived.\f* which were there, and He was praised by everyone as being a good man.
\s Jesus is rejected in the village He came from
\r (Mat. 13:53-58; Mark 6:1-6)
\p
\v 16 Then Jesus went to Nazareth— the place He grew up. As was usual for Him, He went to the synagogue on the Sabbath Day. Then He was given the opportunity to stand before the congregation to read God's Word.
\v 17 It happened that the scrolled book which was given to Him contained the writing of the Prophet Isaiah. Then Jesus opened the scrolled book and found the verses written like this,
\q1
\v 18 “The Spirit of the Lord is on Me,
\q2 and God has commissioned\f + \fr 4:18 \fk commissioned \ft Literally, “anointed (with oil).” The root word for anointed is also the same as for the name of Jesus' position— namely “Christ.” See the note in Luke 2:11.\f* Me to tell the good news to poor people.
\q1 I am also sent by Him to tell the good news to prisoners—
\q2 that through My ministry they'll soon be set free,
\q2 and to blind people—
\q2 that their eyes will be healed;
\q1 and to those who are oppressed—
\q2 that they'll be set free.
\q2
\v 19 And the Lord sent Me to announce this:
\q2 ‘Now is the time promised by God to show His kindness to us!’”\x + Is. 61:1-2\x*
\p
\v 20 Then Jesus rolled up the book and returned it to the official, and He sat down. Everyone present in that meeting house paid serious attention to Him.
\v 21 Then He began to speak to them, saying, “Today, the prophecy in that text was fulfilled when you heard Me read it.”
\p
\v 22 In the beginning, everyone said good things about Jesus. There were those who said, “Every lesson of his is very good and enjoyable to hear.” And there were also those who were amazed and said, “Wow, how can a son of Joseph possibly teach like this?!”\f + \fr 4:22 \fk Wow, how can a son of Joseph… \ft Literally, “Isn't he Joseph's son?!” The people who said that were from Jesus' village who knew Him, for sure, and remembered Joseph— who was considered to be His father. (It's quite likely that when this happened, Joseph was already dead.) But they were amazed with His teaching, and His authority when teaching.\f*
\p
\v 23 Then He said to them, “You'll surely say to Me what people often say— which is ‘Doctor, heal yourself.’ And by that saying you mean to ask this: ‘We've heard that you did miracles in Capernaum. Do the same things here in your own village.’”
\v 24 Then Jesus said, “What I'm telling you is true: No prophet is appreciated in his own home town.
\v 25 And this is also very true: There were many widows in Israel in the time of the Prophet Elijah— that is when rain didn't fall for three years and six months, and a famine happened in this whole land.
\v 26 But Elijah wasn't sent to a single one of the widows of his own land and people, but only to help a widow in the village of Zarephath— near the city of Sidon.
\v 27 And at the time of the Prophet Elisha, there were many people who were sick with leprosy in Israel. But Elisha didn't heal even one of them. Only Naaman— a man from the land of Syria, was healed by him.”
\p
\v 28 When they heard that teaching of Jesus, they realized that Jesus wasn't going to do any miracles for them. Then the crowd in that synagogue became very angry.
\v 29 Then they stood up and chased Him out of the village. Nazareth was built on a hill. So they drove Him to the edge of a cliff and wanted to push Him over the cliff.
\v 30 But Jesus just passed by from among them, and left.
\s Jesus drives an evil spirit out of a man of Capernaum
\r (Mark 1:21-28)
\p
\v 31 Jesus went to Capernaum— a city in the province of Galilee. On the Sabbath Day He taught the people in the synagogue there.
\v 32 When they heard His teaching, they were amazed, because He spoke like a king who has the authority to rule.
\v 33 At the synagogue, there was a man who was possessed by a demon. The man cried out loudly,
\v 34 “Hey you, Jesus the Nazarene! Don't bother us! Oh, you've\f + \fr 4:34 \fk you \ft In this verse, the word to replace Jesus uses a small letter. Even though this evil spirit knew that Jesus was God's Son, he didn't respect and submit to Him. (James 2:19)\f* come to destroy us— have you?! I know who you are! You're the holy messenger from God.”
\v 35 Jesus immediately ordered that demon, “Be quiet! Come out of that man!” Then the evil spirit threw the man to the floor in front of the people present. Then he went out of the man without hurting him.
\p
\v 36 Everyone there was very amazed and said to each other, “Wow! Jesus' teaching is very extraordinary! Like a king who gives commands with full authority, Jesus orders the evil spirits to come out, and they come out.”
\v 37 So news about Jesus spread to the whole region and the surrounding area.
\s Jesus heals many people
\r (Mat. 8:14-17; Mark 1:29-34)
\p
\v 38 Jesus left the synagogue and went to Peter's house.\f + \fr 4:38 \fk Peter \ft Literally, “Simon.”\f* Peter's mother-in-law was sick with a high fever, and they asked Jesus to heal her.
\v 39 Then He stood next to her and ordered the fever harshly, “Be healed.” At that moment, the woman was healed, and then she got up and served them.
\p
\v 40 When the sun began to set,\f + \fr 4:40 \fk When the sun began to set \ft The Sabbath Day for Jews started from the setting of the sun on Friday until the sun set on Saturday. So the residents of that city waited until the Sabbath Day was over so that they could bring sick people to Jesus. And before the sun set, Simon's mother-in-law (in verse 39) served them with lunch which had been prepared before the Sabbath Day, because on the Sabbath Day they weren't permitted to light a fire or cook.\f* every sick person in the city was brought to Jesus by their family members. He healed the sick people of whatever sickness they were suffering from by putting His hand on each of them.
\v 41 And demons also came out of many people. The demons cried out, “You're God's Son!” But Jesus harshly rebuked them. He didn't permit\f + \fr 4:41 \fk didn't permit \ft One of the reasons Jesus didn't permit the demons to say that He was God's Son was that the demons weren't the witnesses that He wanted. And maybe also because it wasn't yet time for everyone to know that He was the Christ and the Son of God.\f* them to speak, because they knew that He was the Christ.\f + \fr 4:41 \fk Christ \ft See the note in Luke 2:11.\f*
\s Jesus goes to other cities
\r (Mark 1:35-39)
\p
\v 42 The next morning, Jesus went to a guiet place. But the crowd looked for Him, and when they found Him, they tried to restrain Him, so that He wouldn't leave them.
\v 43 But He said to them, “I have to take the Good News about God's kingdom\f + \fr 4:43 \fk God's kingdom \ft is the 'rule of God' over everyone who obeys Him. Just as Jesus obeyed the will of God to the point of surrendering Himself as a sacrificial offering, so each of God's people must also surrender themselves to follow His will. (Mark 8:34; Rom. 10:9-10, 12:1-2). In that way, we prove that we've become citizens of God's kingdom and are worthy to receive everything God has promised to His chosen people from the beginning. When Jesus returns, God will rule in reality on this earth— just as God always rules in heaven. See Dan. 7:13-14 and Mat. 6:10\f* to other cities too, because I was sent to this world for that reason.”
\v 44 So he went and told the Good News in the synagogues in the province of Judea.
