\s Jesus sends out His followers
\r (Mat. 9:35-11:1; Mark 6:7-13)
\p
\v 1 Jesus called His twelve disciples together. Then He gave authority to each of them to drive out demons and to heal various sicknesses.
\v 2 Then He sent them out to tell the news about God's kingdom and heal sick people with the Lord's power.
\v 3 He said to them, “Don't take anything at all on the trip— including a walking stick, a bag, bread, money, or even a change of clothes.
\v 4 When you enter a town or village and a family allows you to stay in their house, stay in that house only until you continue your trip again.
\v 5 But if you come to another town or village and the people there don't want to receive you, leave that place and remove its dirt from your feet and sandals as a warning sign to them.”\f + \fr 9:5 \fk remove the dirt … warning … \ft At that time, it had become the habit of Jews— if forced to take a trip in a region of non-Jews, when leaving that region, they cleaned the soles of their feet and their clothes. That was done because they considered non-Jews and their land unclean. Jesus ordered His disciples to do the same thing to Jewish people who rejected God's teaching. In that way, His disciples showed that God considered hard-headed people like that unclean. It was also a sign that they would be punished by God if they didn't repent. See another example of this in Acts.18:6.\f*
\p
\v 6 Then they left and went around to the villages. In every place they visited, they told the Good News from God and healed sick people with the Lord's power.
\s Herod is confused about Jesus
\r (Mat. 14:1-12; Mark 6:14-29)
\p
\v 7 When King Herod heard news about all of the miracles that were done by Jesus, he became confused and nervous. For some people said, “John the Baptist has come back to life from among the dead, but now he's calling himself Jesus.”\f + \fr 9:7 \fk … calling himself Jesus \ft At that time, Herod had just ordered John to be killed (Mat. 14:3-12; Mrk 6:17-29). Then suddenly, the name of Jesus became well-known as a man who did many miracles. So some people who had never seen or known Jesus thought that perhaps John had come back directly from heaven and called himself by a new name. At the time of Jesus, there were many other men also called Jesus. Jesus name in Greek is the same as the name Joshua in Hebrew. Both names mean “Yahweh My Savior.”\f*
\v 8 But there were other people who said, “He's the Prophet Elijah— who was previously taken up alive into heaven, and now he has returned and calls himself Jesus.” And yet others said that Jesus was one of the prophets from times past who had come back to life from death.
\v 9 But Herod said, “I already ordered John's neck be cut off. So who is that man actually— whom I often hear is doing extraordinary things?!” For that reason, Herod tried again and again to see Jesus.
\s Jesus feeds five thousand people
\r (Mat. 14:13-21; Mark 6:30-44; John 6:1-14)
\p
\v 10 After the disciples returned, they told Jesus all that they had done. Then Jesus invited them to go to a city named Bethsaida, to be alone with Him.
\v 11 But the crowd learned about it, so they followed Him. Then Jesus welcomed them and spoke to them about God's kingdom, and healed everyone who was sick.
\p
\v 12 When it was already late afternoon, His twelve disciples came to Him and said, “Order the crowd to go to the villages and to the houses of the residents around here, so that they can get food and a place to sleep. For this is a remote and lonely place.”
\p
\v 13 But Jesus said, “You're the ones who have to give them food.”
\p The disciples answered, “Whoa, if we're the ones to give them food, it means we have to go buy food for them, because we only have five pieces of bread and two fish.”
\v 14 (There were about five thousand men there.)
\p Then Jesus said, “Order them to sit down in groups, and each a group of about fifty people.”
\p
\v 15 The disciples did what He commanded, then everyone sat down.
\v 16 While holding the five pieces of bread and the two fish, Jesus looked up to the sky and gave thanks to God for that food. Then He broke the bread and tore the fish and He gave it to His disciples again and again, while they distributed it to the crowd.
\v 17 Everyone ate until satisfied. And when the disciples gathered the extra bread and fish, it turned out that there were twelve baskets full.
\s Peter said to Jesus, “You're the King of Salvation!” c
\p
\v 18 One day, while Jesus was praying alone, and His disciples were also around there, He asked them, “According to the crowd, whose position am I ministering in?”\f + \fr 9:18 \fk ministering … \ft Jesus literally asked, “Who am I?” The purpose of that question wasn't to ask what His name was, because their answer would certainly have been, “Everyone knows Your name is ‘Jesus.’” Compare with Luk. 9:7-9.\f*
\p
\v 19 Then they answered, “There are those who say that You're like a replacement for John the Baptist, and there are those who say You're the Prophet Elijah who has come back to life, and other people also say that You're one of the prophets from times past who has come back to life.”
\p
\v 20 And He asked, “But what is your opinion about Me?”
\p Peter answered, “You're the Christ\f + \fr 9:20 \fk Christ \ft See note in Luke 2:11.\f* who was sent by God.”
\p
\v 21 And Jesus strictly forbade them not to tell that to anyone at all.
\s Jesus begins to teach that He'll suffer and be killed
\r (Mat. 16:21-28; Mark 8:30-9:1)
\p
\v 22 Then Jesus said, “I— the Son of Man,\f + \fr 9:22 \fk Son of Man \ft See note in Luke 5:24.\f* have been appointed by God to suffer much and be rejected by the Jewish leaders, the chief priests, and the Law experts. Then I will be killed, but on the third day I will be made alive again.”
\p
\v 23 Then He said to all of His disciples again, “Everyone who wants to follow Me has to leave his own self interests\f + \fr 9:23 \fk leave his own self interests \ft Literally, “he has to deny himself. The meaning of Jesus' words is explained in Mat. 10:37-39 and Luke 14:25-33”\f* and follow Me every day, thinking like this, I will keep following the Lord even to the point of death— even death by crucifixion!’\f + \fr 9:23 \fk even death by crucifixion\ft Literally, “he must carry his own cross.”\f*
\v 24 For everyone who fights to keep his life will still die, leaving this world. But whoever is killed because of following Me, will live forever.
\v 25 Think about this: What good is it for you to be rich— even to the point of owning all the wealth of this world, if you don't possess eternal life, and you're destroyed?
\v 26 Everyone who's ashamed to acknowledge this, ‘I follow Jesus and His teaching,’ I won't acknowledge him as My follower either, when I come in My glory, and in the glory of My Father, and in the glory of the heavenly angels later on.
\v 27 What I'm saying is true: Among those of you who are here, some people won't die before seeing the time God begins to set up His kingdom on this earth.”\f + \fr 9:27 \fk won't die before… kingdom… \ft When Jesus healed sick people, it showed that God's kingdom had defeated sickness, demons, and even death. God's kingdom was also revealed at the time His disciples saw Jesus on the mountain with the glory from heaven (Luke 9:28-36). In fact, the moment Jesus died, a Roman officer recognized Him as God's Son, and that meant Jesus was worthy to rule (Mark 15:39). And the resurrection of Jesus (Luke 24) very clearly showed that God's kingdom was already in authority on this earth. Things like that showed that a new government had begun and was evident on this earth.\f*
\s Jesus appears to be shining on the mountaintop
\r (Mat. 17:1-8; Mark 9:2-8)
\p
\v 28 About one week later, after Jesus spoke about those things, He climbed up a mountain with Peter, John, and James to pray.,
\v 29 While He was praying, His face changed, and His clothes became shining white.
\v 30 And suddenly two people appeared, talking to Him— who were Moses and Elijah.
\v 31 They appeared to be shining with heavenly glory and were talking to Jesus about how He would fulfill God's plan with His death in Jerusalem.
\v 32 At that time, Peter and the other two disciples were sleeping soundly.\f + \fr 9:32 \fk sleeping soundly\ft The fact that they were asleep doesn't show that this happened at night. It' likely that this happened in mid to late afternoon, and the three disciples of Jesus fell asleep because God didn't want them to hear all that was spoken between Jesus, Moses, and Elijah. Since it was still during daylight, then the cloud was seen “overshadowing/covering” them in verse 34. But there are still those who think this happened at night, because in Mat. 17:5 that cloud was 'very bright'.\f* When they awakened, they saw Jesus shining with heavenly glory and the two people who stood near Him.
\v 33 When Moses and Elijah were leaving Jesus, Peter said to Him, “Wow Teacher, it's really wonderful that we're here! We'll make three shelters here— one for You, one for Moses, and one more for Elijah.” (Peter said that without thinking what was appropriate for him to say.)
\p
\v 34 While Peter was still talking, a cloud came down and covered them. Then they became afraid when the cloud covered them.
\v 35 Then a voice was heard from the cloud, which said, “This is My Son— whom I've chosen. Listen carefully to Him.”
\p
\v 36 After the voice was quiet, they only saw Jesus alone there. After that event, and for a long time to come, the three disciples didn't tell anyone about what they had witnessed there.
\s Jesus drives an evil spirit out of a boy
\r (Mat. 17:14-18; Mark 9:14-27)
\p
\v 37 The next day when Jesus and His three disciples had gone down from the mountain, a crowd came thronging to meet Jesus.
\v 38 Suddenly a man from among the crowd cried out, “Teacher, help my son! He's my only child.
\v 39 He is repeatedly attacked by an evil spirit, so that he screams, his body convulses, and his mouth foams. The evil spirit rarely leaves him and just keeps torturing him.
\v 40 I've asked Your disciples to drive out the spirit, but they couldn't drive it out.”
\p
\v 41 Then Jesus said to them, “You are terribly misled and don't believe in God! How long do I have to be patient with you! Haven't I been with you long enough! Bring your son here.”
\p
\v 42 When the child approached Jesus, the evil spirit threw him to the ground and made him convulse. But Jesus ordered the evil spirit to leave the child, and healed him, then handed him back to his father.
\v 43 Everyone was very amazed, because they realized they had seen the extraordinary power of God.
\s Jesus speaks about His death
\r (Mat. 17:22-23; Mark 9:30-32)
\p While the people were still amazed about all that He had done, Jesus spoke to His disciples,
\v 44 “Tune in your ears carefully: The Son of Man— who I am, will soon be turned over to the powers of this world.”
\v 45 But His disciples didn't understand the point of Jesus' words. Of course it was God who hid it from them, and because of that they couldn't understand it. But they were also afraid to ask Jesus about the meaning of His words.
\s The character of people who become the most important in God's kingdom
\r (Mat. 18:1-5; Mark 9:33-40)
\p
\v 46 One day, a disagreement happened among Jesus' disciples about who would be number one among them.
\v 47 But Jesus knew what was in their hearts. So He invited a child to stand next to Him.
\v 48 Then He said to them, “If you receive and serve\f + \fr 9:48 \fk receive and serve \ft Literally, “accept”. In the Greek language, the root meaning of this word is to receive a guest whom you don't yet know into your home.\f* a small child like this, for the purpose of glorifying My name, it means you've received and served Me. And if you've served Me, it means you've served God who sent Me to earth. For whoever is in last place among you, he's the one who will become number one.”
\p
\v 49 John said, “Teacher, we saw a person who drove out demons using Your name, then we forbade him, because he isn't part of our group.”
\p
\v 50 But Jesus said to him, “Don't forbid him. For whoever doesn't oppose us is on our side.”
\s Jesus decides to go to Jerusalem through the province of Samaria
\p
\v 51 When it was close to the time for Jesus to be taken up to heaven, His decision to go to Jerusalem was still firm.
\v 52 So Jesus sent some people ahead of Him to prepare several things for Him. So they went, but when they entered a village in the region of Samaria,
\v 53 the people of that village didn't want to receive Jesus, because He was obviously going to Jerusalem.\f + \fr 9:53 \fk because … Jerusalem \ft At the time of Jesus, the Samaritans and the Jews didn't associate. The Jews considered the residents of Samaria to be unclean, because they weren't true Jews, but were descendants of mixed marriages among Jews and other tribes. In the Teaching of Moses, God gave a command to the Jews not to have mixed marriages with other tribes. But most of those tribes moved to the region of Palestine when the Jews were taken to the land of Babylon. The Jews weren't happy with the residents of Samaria either, because their religion wasn't the true Jewish religion. The teachings of their religion had been mixed with the customs of other tribes that had entered the region at the time of the exile of Jews to Babylon.\f*
\v 54 When two of His disciples— that is James and John, saw that they said, “Lord, do You want us to order fire to come down from the sky to destroy them?”\f + \fr 9:54 \fk Verse 54B \ft Some ancient copies in the Greek language add, “like what was done by Elijah.”\f*
\p
\v 55 Then Jesus turned around and rebuked them.\f + \fr 9:55 \fk Verse 55B-56 \ft Several Greek copies add: And He said, ‘You don't know what spirit directs your hearts. The Son of Man— who I am, didn't come to destroy people, but to save them.’\f*
\v 56 Then Jesus and His disciples continued their trip to another village.
\s Regarding the decision to follow Jesus
\r (Mat. 8:19-22)
\p
\v 57 One day, while they were on their trip, a person said to Jesus, “Sir, I'll follow you, wherever you go.”
\p
\v 58 Jesus said to him, “Jungle dogs have holes, and birds have nests, but the Son of Man— who I am, doesn't have a place to rest.”
\p
\v 59 And He said to another person, “Follow Me!”
\p But the person answered, “Sir, allow me to go home first. After my father dies and is buried\f + \fr 9:59 \fk dies and is buried \ft This verse literally says, “Allow me to go bury my father first.” This verse was translated according to the culture of the Jews, and the interpretation that his father hadn't died yet. It's obvious that responsibility to his family was more important than following Jesus. There are also some who say that this man wanted to receive his inheritance before following Jesus.\f* I will follow you.”
\p
\v 60 Then Jesus said to the man, “Let the people who are spiritually dead wait for the death of their fellowman! But you go and keep telling about God's kingdom everywhere.”
\p
\v 61 Another man said, “Sir, I want to follow You, but let me say goodbye to my family first.”
\p
\v 62 But Jesus said to him, “A person who has begun to plow a field— yet looks back, isn't useful in God's kingdom.”
