\s The parable of the dishonest treasurer
\p
\v 1 Jesus said to His disciples again, “There was a rich man who had a treasurer who managed his property. The rich man heard news that his treasurer was squandering his wealth.
\v 2 So the rich man called his treasurer and said, ‘I've heard ugly reports about your work. Because of that, I'm going to fire you as my treasurer. But before that, give me a report about all my property that you've managed.’
\p
\v 3 Then the treasurer said in his heart, ‘What should I do now?! My master is going to fire me, for sure! I can't become a gardener because I'm not strong enough. It would be too embarrassing to become a beggar!
\v 4 Well, I know now what I'll do! I have to act cleverly with some people so that they'll be ready to receive me into their homes when I'm fired as treasurer.’
\p
\v 5 Then he called everyone who was indebted to his master. He said to the first man, ‘How much do you owe my master?’
\v 6 He answered, ‘One hundred clay pots\f + \fr 16:6 \fk clay pots \ft One clay pot contained about thirty liters.\f* of olive oil.’
\p “Then the treasurer said, ‘Friend, this is your debt statement. Sit down and quickly write that it's just fifty jars!’
\p
\v 7 “The treasurer said to the next man, ‘How much is your debt?’
\p “He said, ‘One thousand bushels\f + \fr 16:7 \fk one thousand bushels \ft The measurement is literally, “one hundred kor.” Each kor contained ten, or as many as twelve large baskets or bushels.\f* of wheat.’
\p “He said to the person, ‘Friend, this is your debt statement. Write here that it's just eight hundred!’
\p
\v 8 “Then when the rich man found out about the actions of his dishonest treasurer, he said, ‘Wow, he's clever too— isn't he?!’”
\p Then Jesus explained to His disciples, “The people who live thinking only about this world are usually more clever at managing their worldly problems, of course, than people who've become citizens of the Kingdom of the Light— which is God's kingdom.
\v 9 For that reason, I'm telling each of you sincerelly: Use the riches of this world to find friends— that is worldly friends and heavenly friends, so that when your wealth is gone, you'll be received into various homes forever.
\p
\v 10 “Everyone who can be trusted in small things can also be trusted in big things. And everyone who isn't honest in small things won't be honest in big things either.
\v 11 So if it's obvious that you can't be trusted to honestly manage worldly wealth, then God won't trust you with heavenly wealth either.
\v 12 And if it's obvious that you can't be trusted to manage treasure that isn't actually yours— but belongs to God, then you won't be allowed to own anything in heaven either.
\p
\v 13 “Pay attention to this example: It isn't good for a person to have two masters, because it isn't possible for him to serve both well. He'll certainly love and be faithful to one master, but hate and not care for the other master. In the same way, you can't be God's servant and at the same time serve money.”
\s Jesus points out several faults of the Pharisees
\r (Matt. 5:18, 11:12-13)
\p
\v 14 When the Pharisees heard His teaching, they made fun of Jesus, because they craved money.
\v 15 Then Jesus said to them, “You always try to get others to praise you as good people, but God knows what's in your hearts! For whatever in this world is praised by man is hated by God.
\p
\v 16 “The Law and the writings of the prophets were valid to teach the will of God about the way man should live— until the time John the Baptist began to teach. Since that time, the Good News about God's kingdom has begun being told. Everyone should try hard to enter into God's kingdom.
\v 17 But the heavens and the earth will more easily disappear than for even one period of the Law to be cancelled.
\p
\v 18 “Every husband who divorces his wife and has sex with, or marries another woman again, commits adultery. And the man who has sex with or ,marries a woman who's divorced by her husband, also commits adultery.”
\s The parable of the rich man and Lazarus
\p
\v 19 Jesus also taught them using this parable: “There was a rich man who always wore beautiful robes made of fine cloth. He satisfied his every desire everyday with luxurious living.
\v 20 And there was also a beggar named Lazarus.\f + \fr 16:20 \fk Lazarus \ft The poor man Lazarus in this parable is not Lazarus— the close friend of Jesus, who Jesus brought back to life from death. (John 11)\f* He lay by the gate of that rich man's house everydya. Lazarus' body was covered with pussy, rotten sores.
\v 21 Lazarus was very hungry, and only hoped to eat the leftovers which were thrown away from the rich man's table. But the thing that was even more horrifying, was that dogs often came and licked his sores.
\p
\v 22 “Then Lazarus died, so the angels took him to the most honored place next to Abraham. The rich man also died and was buried.
\v 23 While the rich man was being tormented in hell, he looked up. He saw Abraham and Lazarus from far away. Lazarus was sitting in the most honored place next to Abraham.
\v 24 Then the rich man cried out saying, ‘Father Abraham, have pity on me! I'm terribly tortured by this fire, so help me! Send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and come here to wet my tongue.’
\p
\v 25 “But Abraham answered, ‘My son, remember! You were satisfied with good things when you lived on earth, whereas Lazarus only had bad things. It's only fair that he's comforted here now, while you're tormented there.
\v 26 Besides that, a deep chasm was made between you and us, so that no one can cross over from here to there, or from there to here.’
\p
\v 27 “The rich man said, ‘If that's so, I beg you, Sir, send Lazarus to the home of my parents,
\v 28 because my five brothers are there. Send Lazarus to warn them, so that they don't join me in this place full of suffering!’
\p
\v 29 “But Abraham said, ‘They have the books of the Law of Moses and the prophets'. They should obey what's written in there.’
\p
\v 30 “The rich man said, ‘Father Abraham, that alone isn't enough! But if someone goes to them from the dead, they'll repent.’
\p
\v 31 “But Abraham answered him, ‘If they won't obey what's written in the books of the Law of Moses and the prophets, they still won't believe even if a dead man comes back to life and goes to warn them.’”
