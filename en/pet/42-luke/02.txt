\s The birth of Christ Jesus
\r (Mat. 1:18-25)
\p
\v 1 At that time, the high king of the Roman kingdom— named Augustus, gave a command to hold a census of the residents of every Roman province, for the purpose that all residents pay taxes.
\v 2 This was the first census of residents which was held while Quirinius was in the position of governor of the province of Syria.
\v 3 So each person went to the city of his origin to register himself.
\p
\v 4-5 For that reason, Joseph also went to register himself. He went with Mary— his fiancee, from the city of Nazareth in the province of Galilee. Because Joseph was a descendant of David, they went to the province of Judea and to the city of Bethlehem— which is also called the “city of David.” At the time, Mary was pregnant.
\v 6 While they were there, the time came for Mary to give birth.
\v 7 She gave birth to a Son— her firstborn Child. Mary wrapped Him with a long cloth diaper and laid Him in a wooden box for cattle food. They stayed there for a short time because it happened that at the time all of the rooming houses were full.
\s The shepherds hear about Jesus
\p
\v 8 That night some shepherds were guarding their flocks of sheep in a field outside the city of Bethlehem.
\v 9 Suddenly an angel appeared before them. The light of the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they became very frightened.
\v 10 The angel said to them, “Don't be afraid! I'm giving you good news— that is news which brings much joy to everyone.
\v 11 Today in the city of David, your Savior has been born— who is the Lord who's also called the Christ.\f + \fr 2:11 \fk Christ \ft is a word from the Greek language, which means 'the One who is anointed'. In the Hebrew language, the same term is called 'Messiah'. That term denotes a position, like 'district head' or 'governor'. In the time of the Old Testament, each king was anointed with olive oil by a prophet, as a sign of being chosen and confirmed by God. And each priest and prophet of that time was also anointed. It's appropriate to call Jesus 'the anointed One', because He holds the positions of prophet, High King, and our High Priest (Heb. 4-10). Because of some prophesies in the books of the prophets, and in the Psalms, at the time of Jesus, the Jewish people in general knew the meaning of 'Christ' as the King of Salvation whom God promised, who would come from the descendants of King David, and who would free the people of Israel from the people who opposed them, set up a government with the power of God, and rule with justice. (Is. 9:5-6 [Indonesian verse numbering]; Gen. 3:15; Deut. 18:18-19; Mic. 5:2; Zec. 12:10-14; Mal. 3:1, 4:5-6; Ps. 2, 16, 22, 40, 110)\f*
\v 12 And this will be a sign for you: You'll find a Son who is wrapped in a long cloth diaper and lying in a wooden box for cattle food.”
\v 13 Suddenly there appeared many, many other angels along with that angel— who were troops of heavenly soldiers. They were praising God and saying,
\q1
\v 14 “Glory to God in the highest heaven!
\q2 And everyone who pleases Him on earth should feel calm in His protection!”
\p
\v 15 When those angels left them and returned to heaven, the shepherds said to each other, “Let's go to Bethlehem now to see what has happened— which the Lord has told us about.”
\p
\v 16 Then they went there quickly and met Mary and Joseph. They also saw the Child lying in the wooden box.
\v 17 While the shepherds were visiting the Baby, they told everyone present what the angel had told them about the Child.
\v 18 Everyone who heard the story of the shepherds was amazed.
\v 19 But Mary kept all of those things in her heart and kept thinking about the meaning of it all.
\v 20 Then the shepherds returned to their flocks while glorifying and praising God because of what they saw and heard. Everything was exactly as it was told to them by the angel.
\p
\v 21 When the Child was one week old,\f + \fr 2:21 \fk one week \ft See the note in Luke 1:59.\f* He was circumcised and given the name Jesus— which is the name that was given to Him by the angel before Mary became pregnant with Him.
\s The ceremonies of Mary's cleansing and surrendering Jesus at God's Temple in Jerusalem
\p
\v 22 Forty days after Jesus was born, the time came for Mary and Joseph to give the sacrifice of cleansing God's Temple— like what was commanded by the Law of Moses.\x + Lev. 12:2-8\x* At that opportunity, they also brought Jesus to Jerusalem and surrendered Him to God—
\v 23 according to the regulations written in the Law of the Lord, “Every firstborn boy child has to be surrendered to the Lord.”\x + Ex. 13:2, 12\x*
\v 24 So while they were there, they also offered a sacrifice of “a pair of turtle doves or two young doves” as the requirement for Mary's cleansing after giving birth— according to what was specified in the Law of the Lord.\x + Lev. 12:8\x*
\s Simeon prophesies about Jesus
\p
\v 25-26 At that time in Jerusalem, there was a man named Simeon. He was a man who lived right, and wholeheartedly obeyed the Lord. The Holy Spirit was with him. He had already waited long for the time when God would restore the people of Israel through the work of the Christ— like what was prophesied by the prophets. The Holy Spirit had shown him that he wouldn't die before he saw the Christ.
\v 27 So when Mary and Joseph took Jesus into the courtyard of God's House to surrender their Son to the Lord, according to the regulations of the Law, the Holy Spirit had already moved the heart of Simeon to enter that courtyard earlier.
\v 28 Then Simeon held Him while praising God, saying,
\q1
\v 29 “Oh Lord, now let Your servant
\q2 die feeling calm,
\q2 because You've fulfilled Your promise to me.
\q1
\v 30 With my own eyes, I've seen
\q2 how You'll save Your people
\q2
\v 31 and the way You'll save people of every tribe and people group.
\q1
\v 32 This Boy is like light which will enlighten the non-Jewish people groups who live in darkness,
\q2 and He'll bring glory to Your people Israel.”
\p
\v 33 Joseph and Mary were amazed to hear the things that Simeon said about their Son.
\v 34 Then Simeon prayed that God would bless them. Then he said to Mary, “Listen! According to God's plan, many people of Israel will fall and be punished by God through this Child. And many will also be made right before God through this Child. Even though He was sent by God, many people will reject Him.
\v 35 And through Him, the thoughts that are in many people's hearts will become obvious. And the time will come when your heart will feel pain as if stabbed by a sharp sword.”
\s Hannah sees Jesus
\p
\v 36-37 There was also a woman prophet there named Hannah— the daughter of Phanuel, from the tribe of Asher. Hannah was a widow who was very old— eighty four years old. When she had been married just seven years, her husband died.\f + \fr 2:37 \fk eighty four years old … \ft Many commentators say that what Luke wrote here can also translated, “Hannah was very old. When she had been married just seven years, her husband died. And when this happened, she had been a widow for eighty four years.” So according to that interpretation, Hannah's age at that time might have been around 105 years.\f* After that Hannah was almost always in the courtyard of God's Temple. She worshiped there day and night, while praying and fasting.
\v 38 At that time also, Hannah came into the courtyard and praised God. She spoke about that Child to the crowd that was there— who were longing for the moment God would send the Savior, who was promised to free Jerusalem.\f + \fr 2:38 \fk free Jerusalem \ft The capital Jerusalem represents all of the land of Israel— which at that time was under the power of the Roman kingdom. Under Roman rule, Israel was divided into the provinces of Judea and Galilee.\f*
\s Joseph and Mary return to Nazareth
\p
\v 39 After Joseph and Mary finished all of the regulations of the Lord's Law, they returned to the city of Nazareth in the province of Galilee.
\v 40 The Child grew bigger and stronger. He was full of wisdom, and the kindness of God was always with Him.
\s Jesus' childhood
\p
\v 41 Every year, Jesus' parents went to Jerusalem to join in the celebration of Passover.
\v 42 When Jesus was twelve years old, they went as usual to the celebration.
\v 43-44 After the celebration was over, Joseph and Mary left to return to Nazareth. They thought that Jesus was also in the middle of the group of people who were going home. But He was still in Jerusalem. When their group had traveled for a day, Joseph and Mary began to look for Him among their family group and acquaintances.
\v 45 When they didn't find Him, they returned to Jerusalem to look for Him.
\p
\v 46 After three days, they found Him in the courtyard of God's Temple. He was sitting among the Law experts,\f + \fr 2:46 \fk Law experts \ft Literally, “teachers.” In Luke 5:17 the same group is called “teachers of the Law.” This group also had the task of recopying the books of Moses and all the Word of the Lord. In Bible times, all books had to be written by hand of course, because there weren't any printing tools yet. Because of their education and expertise in the books of God's Word, they became religious teachers, lawyers, and judges for the Jews. They also became a religious group that was very respected, and which also got involved in politics. Like the Pharisee group, they weren't happy with Jesus either. Jesus rebuked the Pharisee group along with the Law experts in Luke 11:37-54, because they only pretended to be good people.\f* while listening to them and presenting questions to them.
\v 47 Everyone who heard Him was very amazed because of His knowledge and wise answers— when He answered the questions of the Law experts.
\v 48 When His parents saw Him, they were amazed too. Mary said to Him, “Why did You do this to us, Son?! For several days Your father and I have been so worried, looking for You everywhere!”
\p
\v 49 Jesus said to them, “Why were you looking for Me? You should have known that I would be in My Father's House, of course.”
\v 50 But they didn't understand His answer.
\p
\v 51 Then He went home with them to Nazareth, and He always obeyed His parents. But His mother kept and meditated on all of those events in her heart.
\v 52 Jesus grew older and wiser, as well as more pleasing before God and also before man.
