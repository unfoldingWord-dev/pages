\c 21
\s A poor widow gives all of her money to God
\r (Mark 12:41-44)
\p
\v 1 While Jesus was in the courtyard of God's Temple, He observed rich people who were putting money in the offering box.
\v 2 He also noticed a poor widow putting in two metal coins of the least value.
\v 3 Then Jesus said, “I'm telling you the truth: The value of the offering of this poor widow is greater than the offerings of all of those other people!
\v 4 For all of those people gave a small part of the excess of their wealth, whereas this widow who's very poor, gave everything she owned. She doesn't have anything else that can be used to buy food.”
\s Jesus teaches about the end of the age
\r (Matt. 24:1-14; Mark 13:1-13)
\p
\v 5 At that time there were some people talking about the complex of God's Temple. They were in awe looking at the huge and wonderful stones of the building, and the things offered which decorated the building.
\v 6 Then Jesus said to them, “The time will come when all that you see will be torn down— until there won't even be one stone that is still on top of another stone.”
\v 7 Then they asked Him, “Teacher, when will those things happen? And what will be the sign that those things will soon happen?”
\p
\v 8 Then Jesus answered, “Be careful, so you don't go along in being deceived! For many people will rise up and say, ‘I'm the Christ, and the final age will soon happen!’ Don't become followers of them.
\v 9 And don't be afraid if you hear all kinds of news of wars and disturbances. For all of this must happen first, but those aren't the only things that show you've entered the final age of the world.”
\p
\v 10 Then Jesus spoke again, “There will be wars between different ethnic groups and between countries.
\v 11 And later on, earthquakes and famines will also happen in various places. Great disasters and terrifying signs will occur in the sky.
\p
\v 12 But before all of that happens, people will arrest you and persecute you. And there will be those of you who will be tried in the Jewish synagogues, and some will be imprisoned. And because you believe in Me, there will be those of you who will be dragged off and presented before kings and authorities.
\v 13 Those events are opportunities given to you by the Lord so that you testify to them about Me.
\v 14 For that reason, before you're tried in a courtroom, don't worry saying, “What should I say to defend myself?”
\v 15 For I Myself will enable you to speak with wise words, so that those who oppose you won't be able to dispute or argue with what you say.
\v 16 Even parents, brothers and sisters, family and close friends of yours will betray you. And from among you there'll be many whom they'll kill.
\v 17 And wherever you go, there'll be people who hate you because you believe in Me.
\v 18 Even though they can kill your body, they really can't do anything to you. Not even one strand of your hair will be lost!
\v 19 You'll gain eternal life by continuing to endure in that trouble .”
\s The city of Jerusalem will be destroyed
\r (Matt. 24:15-21; Mark 13:14-19)
\p
\v 20 “When you see Jerusalem surrounded by soldiers, know that the time has come for the city to be destroyed.
\v 21 At that time, you who are still in the province of Judea must run away to the mountains. And you who are in the city of Jerusalem must get out of that city quickly. And you who are outside of the city, don't enter it again.
\v 22 For that's the time God will repay the evil of these people, so that everything written by the prophets about that punishment is fulfilled.
\v 23 At the time that disaster happens, what a pity for pregnant women and those who nurse! They'll really suffer because it'll be hard for them to run away. Great trouble will fall on all of the residents of this land, because the Lord will show His wrath toward this people group.
\v 24 Many will be killed with the sword, and many will be taken as captives to every land of non-Jewish people too. Then those people groups will overpower Jerusalem until the time that the Lord has determined for them is finished.”
\s Jesus teaches about His return from heaven
\r (Matt. 24:29-35; Mark 13:24-31)
\p
\v 25 “There'll be miracles in the sun, moon, and stars. And all the people groups on earth will be afraid and confused facing the violence of the ocean waves, which will make a loud noise like thunder.
\v 26 People will be very frightened because of worrying about all that's happening on this earth, because the spiritual powers that manage the objects in the sky will become chaotic.
\v 27 Then people on earth will see Me— the Son of Man, coming in the clouds full of power, and with brilliantly shining rays.
\v 28 And at the time those things begin to happen, get up and encourage your hearts, for God will quickly save you!”
\p
\v 29 Then Jesus told this parable: “Pay attention to the fig tree and to other trees.
\v 30 When you see those trees begin to put out buds, you know that summer is near.
\v 31 In the same way, if you see those signs happening, know that the time for God to set up His kingdom on earth is near.
\p
\v 32 What I'm telling you is true: All of those signs will happen while people of this age are still living.
\v 33 All of those things will definitely take place. The sky and earth will disappear, but My teachings will last forever.”
\s Always be ready
\p
\v 34 “Be on guard! Don't be too engrossed in wild parties and drunkenness, and don't keep worrying about daily necessities, so that on the last day you're trapped!
\v 35 Because the last day will come suddenly, on all the people on earth.
\v 36 So stay on guard! And always pray that you're able to endure and can escape from all the things that will happen, so that you can welcome My coming with joy, and without shame.”
\p
\v 37 Every day of that week, Jesus gave His teachings in the courtyard of God's Temple, and in the evenings He went and spend the night on the Mount of Olives.
\v 38 Then very early in the morning, the whole crowd would get up and come to the courtyard of God's Temple to hear His teaching.
