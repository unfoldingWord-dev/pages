\s The parable about the lost sheep
\r (Matt. 18:12-14)
\p
\v 1 One day, tax collectors and many other people who were also known as sinners were coming to Jesus to hear His teachings.
\v 2 On seeing that, the Law experts and the Pharisees complained. They said, “Eeww, he receives sinful people— even eats with them!”
\p
\v 3 Because of that, Jesus told them this parable:
\v 4 “If one of you has a hundred sheep and then one of the sheep gets lost, he'll leave the other ninety-nine sheep in the meadow, of course, and go look for the lost sheep until he finds it.
\v 5 When he has found it, he'll gladly pick it up, put it on his shoulders and carry it home.
\v 6 After arriving home, he'll call his friends and neighbors and say to them, ‘Rejoice with me, because I've found my lost sheep!’
\v 7 I'm telling you, in the same way, God and all the residents of heaven will be more joyful when they see a sinful person repent, than for ninety-nine righteous people who don't need to repent.”
\s The parable about the lost silver coin
\p
\v 8 “Or if a woman has ten silver coins and one coin gets lost, she will light a lamp, of course, and sweep her house, in order to search carefully for it until she finds it.
\v 9 After she finds it, she'll call her friends and neighbors and say, ‘Rejoice with me, because I've found the money that I lost!’
\v 10 I'm telling you, in the same way, the angels always rejoice before God the Father when they witness a sinful person repent!”
\s The parable about the lost younger brother and the very compassionate father
\p
\v 11 Jesus said again, “There was a father who had two sons.
\v 12 The younger son said to his father, ‘Father, give me my share of the inheritance. I don't need to wait until you die.’ So the father divided his inheritance between his two sons.
\p
\v 13 “Several days later, the youngest sold all his treasure and then went off to a faraway land. He squandered his money there on every kind of worldly pleasure.
\v 14 Finally, all of the money was gone. Then a severe famine happened in the land, and he became poor and hungry.
\v 15 Then the youngest son went to a resident of the land to ask for work. The man gave him work— which was ordering him to feed the pigs in the field.
\v 16 And the youngest son was so hungry that he wanted to eat the pig food— the hard plants given to the pigs, because no one gave him any food.
\p
\v 17 “He finally realized his situation and said in his heart, ‘All of my father's servants get enough food— even more than enough, while I'm almost starving to death here!
\v 18 I'll get up and return to my father, and say to him, “Father, forgive me! I've wronged you and have sinned against God.
\v 19 I don't deserve to be called your son anymore. I'm asking you to receive me as just one of your servants.’
\v 20 Then he got up and returned to his father.
\p “But when the youngest son was still far from his father's house, his father saw him coming and had compassion on him. That very moment, the father ran to meet his son, and then hugged and kissed him.
\v 21 Then the youngest son said to his father, ‘Father, forgive me! I've wronged you and sinned against God. I don't deserve to be called your son anymore.’
\p
\v 22 “But the father said to his servants, ‘Quickly get my best robe and put it on him! Put one of my rings on his finger and a pair of sandals on his feet.
\v 23 Then bring the fattened calf and butcher it. Let's eat it and rejoice,
\v 24 because it's as if this son of mine was lost and dead, but he's obviously still alive and has returned to me!’ So they began to party.
\p
\v 25 “While this was happening, the oldest son was working in the field. When he went home and got near the house, he heard the sound of music and the noise of people dancing.
\v 26 Then he called one of the servants who worked in his house and asked him, ‘Why is a party going on in the house?’
\v 27 The servant answered, ‘Your younger brother has returned, master. And your father ordered us to butcher the fattened calf, because he's gotten his son back safely.’
\p
\v 28 “The oldest son was very angry and didn't want to go into the house. Then his father went out and urged him to come in.
\v 29 But the son answered his father, ‘I don't want to! For years I've worked for you and always obeyed your commands, yet you've never even given me a goat so that I could have a good time with my friends!
\v 30 But just now your youngest son— who wasted your wealth on prostitutes, has come back, so you immediately butcher the best calf for him!’
\p
\v 31 “Then the father said, ‘That's true, son, you're always with me, and everything I own is yours too.
\v 32 But we should rejoice and celebrate your younger brother's homecoming, because I thought your younger brother was lost and dead, but it turns out that he's still alive and has come back to us.’”
