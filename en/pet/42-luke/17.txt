\s Some advice
\r (Matt. 18:6-7, 21-22; Mark 9:42)
\p
\v 1 Jesus said to His disciples, “In this world, there will always be temptations so that people fall into sin, of course. But the person who causes those things to happen is unfortunate.
\v 2 If a person causes someone else who isn't yet spiritually mature— like these children, to sin, that person will get a very harsh punishment from God. Instead of committing that great of a sin, it would be better if a huge rock was tied around his neck\f + \fr 17:2 \fk huge rock \ft Literally, “grinding stone.” This means a huge rock that was moved by the power of man or donkey to grind grains of wheat into flour.\f* and he be thrown into the deep ocean. That trouble would be far less than the eternal punishment from God that he would experience if he caused a person who isn't yet spiritually mature to fall into sin!
\v 3 For that reason guard yourselves! Don't do something like that!
\p “If your brother in the faith does wrong to you, rebuke him. If he regrets his wrong, forgive him.
\v 4 In fact, if he does wrong to you seven times a day, and he also comes to you seven times and says, ‘I'm regret my wrong doing, and because of that I ask for forgiveness,’ you should forgive him.”
\s Faith that can move a tree
\p
\v 5 Then the twelve apostles said to the Lord, “Help us so that we believe in God more.”
\p
\v 6 Then the Lord said, “If your faith is as big as a mustard seed, you can say to this tree,\f + \fr 17:6 \fk tree \ft Literally, “mulberry tree.” It's fruit is small, sweet, and almost black.\f* ‘Be pulled out of the ground and be planted in the ocean,’ then that tree will obey your command.”
\s Become a humble slave of God
\p
\v 7 “If one of you has a slave who plows in the field or shepherds your sheep, when that slave comes home from the field, of course you won't say to him, ‘Come in and eat.’
\v 8 Instead you'll say to the slave, ‘Prepare food for me. Put on clothes for working in the house. Serve me at the dinner table until I'm done eating. After that you may eat.’
\v 9 And you don't need to say thanks to the slave when he has finished doing the things you commanded.
\v 10 Each of you should be like that too. When you've done everything that God commanded you, you should say, ‘I'm just an ordinary slave. I'm just doing my job.’”
\s Ten men were healed, but only one expressed thanks
\p
\v 11 While Jesus was on a trip to Jerusalem, He walked through a region on the border of Samaria and Galilee.
\v 12 When He entered a village, ten men who were sick with a contagious skin disease came to Him, but they stood some distance away.
\v 13 Then they cried out to Him, “Lord Jesus, have pity on us.”
\p
\v 14 While looking at them Jesus said, “Each of you go and show yourselves to a priest.”
\p Then they went, and while they were on their way, they were healed.
\v 15 But when one of them saw that he had been healed, he returned to Jesus while praising God with a loud voice.
\v 16 Then he knelt down in front of Jesus' feet and thanked Him. That man wasn't a Jew, but a Samaritan.\f + \fr 17:16 \fk Samaritan \ft This Samaritan couldn't possibly show himself to a Jewish priest, because all Samaritans were rejected, and considered to be unclean by Jews. See the note in Luke 9:53.\f*
\v 17 Then Jesus said, “I healed ten men— right?! So why didn't the other nine men return?
\v 18 How sad! Only the man who isn't a Jew returned to thank God.”
\v 19 Then Jesus said to him, “Stand up and go. Because you believed in Me, you've become well.”
\s God's kingdom and Christ's coming
\r (Matt. 16:25; 24:23-28, 37-41)
\p
\v 20 Some of the Pharisees asked Jesus, “When will God come to set up His kingdom?”
\p Jesus answered, “God's kingdom won't begin to be set up with signs that can be seen.
\v 21 People won't say, ‘The capitol of God's kingdom is here!’ or ‘God has set up His kingdom there!’ For God's government has already begun among us.”\f + \fr 17:21 \fk Verse 21B \ft This last verse can also be translated, “For God rules as King inside each of you.”\f*
\p
\v 22 Then He said to His disciples, “A time will come later on, when you'll really long for Me like this, ‘Oh, how wonderful it would be if Jesus returned today and ruled as the Son of Man!’\f + \fr 17:22 \fk Son of Man \ft See the note in Luke 5:24.\f* But that won't happen.
\v 23 People will say to you, ‘Look, Jesus is here now!’ or ‘He's there!’ But don't believe it or go where they say.
\v 24 For on the day that I— the Son of Man return, it will be like lightning flashing in the sky, and lighting up the sky from one point to another.
\v 25 But before that, I have to suffer much, and people living at this time will reject Me.
\p
\v 26 “On the day I return, it will be just like the situation of people who lived in Noah's time.
\v 27 For they didn't think that a disaster would fall on them. They were busy eating and drinking, men were marrying women, and women were being married by men. They kept on living as usual until the time came when Noah entered the huge boat, and the great flood came and destroyed them all.
\p
\v 28 “The day of My return will also come like the disaster that happened during Lot's time. The residents of Sodom were living as usual. There were those who were busy eating and drinking, and those who were busy buying and selling. There were those who were tilling the ground, and those who were building houses.
\v 29 But suddenly, the moment Lot went out of the city, a rain of fire and sulfur fell from the sky and destroyed all of them.
\v 30 In the same way, without people realizing it, the day when I come to rule as the Son of Man will happen suddenly.
\p
\v 31 “On that day, a person who's on his terrace\f + \fr 17:31 \fk on his terrace \ft Literally, “on the roof of the house.” In the land of Israel, the roofs of houses were flat, and were used like Indonesians use a terrace or the yard of a house.\f*must not go back inside to take some of his possessions. The same with someone who is in a field, he must not go back to his house.
\v 32 Remember what happened to Lot's wife!\x + Gen. 19:15-17, 26\x*
\p
\v 33 “Each one who struggles to keep his life in this world, will still lose his life. But each one who's ready to sacrifice his life because of following Me, will gain eternal life.
\p
\v 34 “I'm telling you sincerely: At the time of My return, things like this will happen: On that night, two people will be sleeping in the same bed. One will be taken by an angel, and the other will be left behind.
\v 35-36 And in another place, two women will be grinding wheat with a grinding stone. One will be taken, and the other one will be left behind.”\f + \fr 17:36 \fk Verse 36 \ft Some ancient copies of the Greek language add these words from Matt.24:40: Two men will be working in a field. One will be taken by an angel, and the other will be left behind.\f*
\p
\v 37 Then Jesus' disciples said to Him, “Where will that happen, Lord?”
\p He answered, “The situation later on will be like what's often said, ‘Wherever there's a carcass, the birds of prey always gather there too.’”\f + \fr 17:37 \fk quote of a proverb \ft There are several interpretations of the meaning of the proverb given to Jesus' disciples. Among them, 1) Christ's coming will later be clearly seen. 2) God's judgment will certainly fall on people who are spiritually dead.\f*
