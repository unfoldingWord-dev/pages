%%\%%c 1 %%\%%s Luke's introduction %%\%%p %%\%%v 1 Dear Mr. Theophilus,%%\%%f + %%\%%fr 1:1 %%\%%fk Theophilus %%\%%ft The name Theophilus means 'person who loves God', or 'close friend of God'. It's possible that Luke wrote this Gospel as a report to a person whose name was Theophilus. But because of the meaning of that name, many interpreters think that Luke's report was directed to everyone who loves God.%%\%%f* Many people have worked to write reports about the different events that happened among us. %%\%%v 2 They wrote their reports according to what had been told by the people who witnessed these events for themselves from the beginning. Those eyewitnesses have served the Lord by telling that news everywhere. %%\%%v 3 So because I have investigated all of these events from the eyewitnesses very carefully, from the beginning, I thought, “It would be good to write an orderly report to Mr. Theophilus.” %%\%%v 4 In that way, Sir, you'll know that what was taught you is really true. %%\%%s The angel Gabriel tells about the birth of John the Baptist %%\%%p %%\%%v 5 At the time Herod was ruling as king in the province of Judea, under the government of the great king of Rome, there was a priest named Zechariah. He was one of the members of a group of priests that was named the Abijah group.%%\%%f + %%\%%fr 1:5 %%\%%fk Abijah group %%\%%ft The priests were divided into twenty-four groups, to organize the times they had duties in God's Temple each year. See 1 Chr. 24.%%\%%f* His wife's name was Elizabeth. She also came from the descendants of Aaron— the first priest. %%\%%v 6 The lives of Zechariah and his wife pleased the heart of God, because they always lived right according to the will of God— that is always obeying all of the commands and regulations of the Lord without fault. %%\%%v 7 But they didn't have any children because Elizabeth was barren, and they were already very old, too. %%\%%p %%\%%v 8 One day, when the Abijah group got their turn to serve in God's Temple, Zechariah carried out his task as priest before God. %%\%%v 9 And as was the custom of the priests, they cast lots to determine who would burn incense in the part of God's Temple called the Holy Room. And it happened that Zechariah was chosen for that task. %%\%%v 10 When the time came to burn incense and Zechariah had gone into the Holy Room, there were many people praying outside in the courtyard of God's Temple, according to the custom for the hour of prayer. %%\%%p %%\%%v 11 Then suddenly, he saw an angel standing to the right side of the altar, which was the place for burning incense. %%\%%v 12 When Zechariah saw the angel, he was shocked and very frightened. %%\%%v 13 But the angel said to him, “Don't be afraid, Zechariah. God has heard your prayer: Your wife Elizabeth will give birth to a boy for you. You should name him John. %%\%%v 14 You'll rejoice and be happy because of your son, and many people will also rejoice with you because of his birth. %%\%%v 15 For he'll become a great man before God. As a sign that he has beenset apart for God, he can't drink wine or other strong drinks.%%\%%f + %%\%%fr 1:15 %%\%%fk As a sign… can't drink wine… %%\%%ft The same command was also given to the parents of Samson (Judges 13:5, 7), so the parents of John thought their child would become a prophet, of course.%%\%%f* He'll always be filled with the Holy Spirit— even from within his mother's womb. %%\%%v 16 He'll lead many Israelites so that they return to the Lord— their God. %%\%%v 17 He'll prepare God's people before the Lord comes to this earth. God's Spirit will give him power to work like the prophet Elijah worked. As a result of his ministry, parents will love their children again, and he'll lead people who don't obey the Lord to become obedient again. And their way of thinking will become wise again, so they'll want to live right. %%\%%p %%\%%v 18 Then Zechariah said to the angel, “How can I be certain that what you say will actually happen? My wife and I are too old to have a child of our own!” %%\%%p %%\%%v 19 Then the angel answered, “My name is Gabriel. I always stand before God, and I'm always ready to bring His news. He's the one who ordered me to give you this good news. %%\%%v 20 Listen! What I told you will definitely happen in its time. But because you don't believe my words, you'll become mute and unable to speak, until the moment all of this becomes reality.” %%\%%p %%\%%v 21 Meanwhile, the crowd was still waiting for Zechariah outside. They were amazed because he was in the Holy Room so long. %%\%%v 22 When he came out, he had already become mute and couldn't speak to them anymore. He could only give signs to them with his hands. Finally they realized that he had seen a vision in the Holy Room. %%\%%v 23 After finishing his turn of duty, Zechariah went back to his home in the village. %%\%%p %%\%%v 24 Not long after that, his wife Elizabeth got pregnant. For five months Elizabeth didn't go anywhere, and didn't show herself to other people, %%\%%v 25 because she thought, “People have already insulted me for so long because of being barren, but the Lord has finally had compassion on me. So let people know that I'm pregnant when they see me!” %%\%%s The angel Gabriel tells Mary about the birth of Jesus %%\%%p %%\%%v 26-27 When Elizabeth was six months pregnant, God sent the angel Gabriel to a young virgin named Mary, who lived in the city of Nazareth, in the province of Galilee. Mary was engaged to Joseph— a descendant of David. %%\%%v 28 As soon as the angel arrived, he said, “Greetings! The Lord is really kind to you. He's with you!” %%\%%p %%\%%v 29 Mary was very shocked to hear the words of the angel and asked in her heart what that greeting meant. %%\%%p %%\%%v 30 Then the angel spoke to her again, “Don't be afraid, Mary. God is very kind to you. %%\%%v 31 Listen! You'll get pregnant and give birth to a boy Child. You should name Him Jesus. %%\%%v 32 He'll become a Great Man, and He'll be called the Son of the Most High God. And the Lord God will raise Him up to become King, like David— His forefather. %%\%%v 33 And He'll rule the Jews— who are the descendants of Jacob, forever, and His kingdom will never end.” %%\%%p %%\%%v 34 Then Mary said to the angel, “Wow! How can all that possibly happen, because I haven't ever married!” %%\%%p %%\%%v 35 And the angel answered, “The Holy Spirit will come to you, and the power of the Most High will come upon you, so that the holy Child whom you will give birth to will be called God's Son. %%\%%v 36 Your relative Elizabeth is now six months pregnant too, and she'll give birth to a boy child, even though she's very old and people say that she's barren, %%\%%v 37 because nothing is impossible for God. %%\%%p %%\%%v 38 Mary said, “I'm a lowly servant of the Lord. May what you've said happen to me.” Then the angel went and left her. %%\%%s Mary visits Elizabeth %%\%%p %%\%%v 39 Not long after that, Mary hurried and got ready, and went to a village in the mountain region of the province of Judea, %%\%%v 40 to visit Elizabeth and Zechariah. When Mary went into their house, she greeted Elizabeth. %%\%%v 41 When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the child in Elizabeth's womb kicked for joy. Then Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit. %%\%%v 42 In a loud voice she said, “Mary, you of all women are the most blessed by God! And the Child who's now in your womb is also very blessed! %%\%%v 43 Now I've really received a great honor, because the mother who will give birth to my Lord has come to visit me. %%\%%v 44 For as soon as I heard your greeting, the child in my womb kicked for joy. %%\%%v 45 You're so happy because you believed that what the Lord told you will be fulfilled!” %%\%%s Mary praises God %%\%%p %%\%%v 46 Then Mary said, %%\%%q1 “I praise the Lord God with all my heart, %%\%%q2 %%\%%v 47 and I really rejoice because God is my Savior. %%\%%q1 %%\%%v 48 For He has paid attention to me, %%\%%q2 even though I'm the Lord's lowly servant. %%\%%q1 So from now on and forever, %%\%%q2 everyone will remember how the Lord blessed me, %%\%%q1 %%\%%v 49 because the Almighty has done amazing things for me. %%\%%q2 Praise God, for He's holy! %%\%%q1 %%\%%v 50 And from age to age, God always has compassion on everyone %%\%%q2 who fears and respects Him. %%\%%q1 %%\%%v 51 In this age, as in ages past, %%\%%q1 God has once more begun to stretch out His hand and show His power. %%\%%q2 In times past, He scattered the people who were conceited, %%\%%q2 and confused all of their plans. %%\%%q2 %%\%%v 52 In times past, God also brought down kings from their positions, %%\%%q2 and He raised up people who were humble. %%\%%q2 %%\%%v 53 And in times past, God gave delicious food to hungry people, until they were full, %%\%%q2 but He ordered rich people to go away empty-handed. %%\%%q1 %%\%%v 54 So once more, as in times past, God is helping Israel— %%\%%q2 His chosen people, so that we sincerely serve Him. %%\%%q1 He didn't forget His promise to have compassion on us— %%\%%q2 %%\%%v 55 like His promise to our forefathers, %%\%%q2 beginning with Abraham, up to us his descendants, %%\%%q2 and until forever.” %%\%%p %%\%%v 56 Mary stayed with Elizabeth for about three months, and then she went home to Nazareth. %%\%%s John the Baptist is born %%\%%p %%\%%v 57 When her time was complete, Elizabeth gave birth to a boy. %%\%%v 58 Then all of her neighbors and relatives heard how the Lord had such compassion on Elizabeth, and they rejoiced with her. %%\%%p %%\%%v 59 When the child was one week old,%%\%%f + %%\%%fr 1:59 %%\%%fk one week %%\%%ft Literally, “eight days.” If a baby boy was born on Monday, then he was circumcised on the following Monday. The way the Jews counted, the first day and the last day were counted. So in the example above, the first Monday and the last Monday were counted, so the total was eight days.%%\%%f* many guests came to attend the child's circumcision ceremony. They wanted to give him the name Zechariah— according to his father's name. %%\%%v 60 But Elizabeth said, “No! He has to be given the name John.” %%\%%p %%\%%v 61 Then they answered, “But there's no one in either of your families who has that name! %%\%%v 62 So they gave a sign to the boy's father to ask, “Sir, what name do you want to give him?” %%\%%p %%\%%v 63 Then Zechariah asked for a writing stone, and wrote, “His name is John”, so they were all amazed. %%\%%v 64 And at that very moment, Zechariah could speak again, and he began to praise God. %%\%%v 65 Their neighbors all became amazed and afraid, and the news about all these events spread everywhere in the whole mountain region of Judea. %%\%%v 66 Everyone who heard about these things asked in their hearts, “Will this child become an important person?” They asked that because the Lord was obviously with him. %%\%%s Zechariah praises God, and prophesies %%\%%p %%\%%v 67 Then Zechariah— John's father, was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied like this, %%\%%q1 %%\%%v 68 “Praise the Lord, the God of Israel. %%\%%q2 For He has come back to help His people %%\%%q2 and to free us from our enemies. %%\%%q1 %%\%%v 69 God has given us a Savior, %%\%%q2 who's ready to rule with full authority, %%\%%q2 and who comes from the descendants of His servant David. %%\%%q1 %%\%%v 70 This is according to the plan of God %%\%%q2 which was given by the prophets, who served Him since times past. %%\%%q1 %%\%%v 71 For they told that God would save us from our enemies %%\%%q2 and from the power of those who hate us. %%\%%q1 %%\%%v 72 And now, it's proven that God didn't forget to do according to His holy promises %%\%%q2 which He promised to our forefathers— %%\%%q2 which was to show His kindness to us. %%\%%q1 %%\%%v 73 For God already promised with an oath to Abraham— our forefather, %%\%%q2 %%\%%v 74 that we would be freed from the power of our enemies, %%\%%q2 so that we could serve God without feeling afraid, %%\%%q2 %%\%%v 75 and in that way we can live holy and right before Him for as long as we live. %%\%%q1 %%\%%v 76 And regarding you— my little child, %%\%%q1 you'll be called a prophet of the Most High God, and you'll go before the Lord %%\%%q2 preparing everything for His coming. %%\%%q1 %%\%%v 77 This means that you'll tell His people how they can be saved %%\%%q2 through forgiveness of their sins. %%\%%q1 %%\%%v 78 So because of the kindness of our God, %%\%%q2 a new day— the Day of Salvation from heaven, will shine on us. %%\%%q1 %%\%%v 79 In that way, God will help us who live in darkness %%\%%q2 and in fear of death. %%\%%q1 The light of the Lord will lead us to the Lord's way, %%\%%q2 so that we live with the feeling of calm in His protection.” %%\%%p %%\%%v 80 John grew big and his spirit grew strong. When he was old enough, he lived in the desert until the time came for him to reveal himself to the people of Israel.
