\s Women were also involved in Jesus' ministry
\p
\v 1 Not long after that, Jesus went around to many cities and villages to preach and announce the news of salvation from God— which is the Good News about God's kingdom. And His twelve disciples went with Him.
\v 2 There were some women with them, whom Jes,us had healed from various diseases, and freed from evil spirits. Among them were
\q1 Mary— who came from the village of Magdala and who had been set free from seven demons,\f + \fr 8:2 \fk demons \ft Greek uses three terms which have the same meaning, and all three are used in this chapter. In the TSI 'demon' is used to translate 'daimonion', while 'evil spirit' is used to translate “pneumati poneras/pneumati akathartos.” ('unclean spirit')\f*
\q1
\v 3 Johanna, the wife of Chuza (Chuza was Herod's head of palace operations),
\q1 Susannah,
\q1 and still many other woman.
\m All of those women often helped with Jesus' and His disciples needs, using their own money.
\s The parable about the seeds that were scattered
\r (Mat. 13:1-9; Mark 4:1-10)
\p
\v 4 When people from every city just kept coming to Jesus, and their number was great, Jesus told them this parable:
\p
\v 5 “One day, a farmer went to scatter seeds in a field. While he was scattering the seeds, some fell on the road, then were stepped on by people, and eaten by birds until they were gone.
\v 6 And some others fell on rocky ground. As soon as they sprouted, they quickly wilted, because the layer of soil there was dry.
\v 7 Some others fell among thorny weeds. When the seeds grew and sprouted with the weeds, then the weeds choked them so that they died.
\v 8 Whereas some others fell on ground that was fertile, then grew well, and from one seed, one hundred seeds were produced.”
\p After Jesus finished that parable, He cried out, “You have ears— don't you?! So listen well!”
\s Jesus explains the meaning of the parable of the seeds that were scattered
\r (Mat. 13:10-23; Mark 4:10-20, 24-25)
\p
\v 9 After that, His disciples asked Jesus, “What's the meaning of that parable?”
\p
\v 10 Then He said, “Before this, man wasn't permitted to understand the teachings about God's kingdom.\f + \fr 4:11 \fk God's kingdom \ft See the note in Luke 4:43.\f* But now you've been given permission to understand such secret things. But to the others, I teach those things in parables. For God wants what was written by the prophet to happen— when God said,s
\q1 ‘Even though they see miracles,
\q2 they won't realize what happened.
\q1 And even though they keep hearing teachings,
\q2 they won't understand.’”\x + Is. 6:9\x*
\p
\v 11 “This is the meaning of the similarities in that parable:
\m The seeds represent teachings from God.
\m
\v 12 And the seeds that fell on the road illustrate people who hear God's teachings, but the devil comes and steals those teachings from their hearts, so that they won't believe them and won't be saved.
\m
\v 13 The seeds that fell on the rocky ground illustrate people who when they hear God's teachings, accept them with glad hearts. But those teachings can't grow in their hearts. They believe for just a short while. When they have troubles in their lives, they leave the teachings behind.
\m
\v 14 The seeds that fell among thorny weeds illustrate the people who've heard God's teachings, but in living their daily lives, they worry, while chasing after the wealth of the world, and worldly pleasure. All of those things choke the growth of those teachings, so that they can't produce anything good in their lives.
\m
\v 15 And the seeds that fell on fertile ground illustrate those who, when they hear God's teaching, keep it well in their sincere hearts, then they obey while continuing to persevere in those teachings. They're like fertile ground that produces much fruit.”\f + \fr 8:15 \fk produces much fruit \ft In other places in God's Word, we can see the way men can 'produce fruit'. First, the Good News from God enables people to believe. We also see that a person can 'produce fruit' if he faithfully does what God has commanded him. (Mat. 5-7) We also 'produce fruit' if the words that come out of our mouths are good in the eyes of God. (Mat. 12:31-37) And we also 'produce fruit' if we lead another person to repent. (John 15:16) A life like that is like good fruit in God's eyes.\f*
\s We should understand the teachings of Jesus
\r (Mat. 13:12; Mark 4:21-25)
\p
\v 16 Then Jesus added this parable: “A person would never light a lamp and then cover it with a bucket! He would never put it under a bed either. But a lamp is always put in a high place, so that those who come into the house are enlightened by it.
\v 17 It's the same with all of the lessons which I teach in parables to the crowd: The meaning is kept secret now, but everything will be opened up later on. What isn't clear now, will become clear later on.
\v 18 For that reason, pay close attention to the way you listen to My teachings. For to everyone who accepts My teachings, God will add to his ability so that he understands more. But to everyone who doesn't accept My teachings— even though he thinks he understands a little, God will take the ability to understand away from him.”
\s The character of people whom Jesus considers to be His family
\r (Mat. 12:46-50; Mark 3:31-35)
\p
\v 19 Then His mother and brothers came to meet Jesus, but they couldn't meet with Him because of the crowd that was surrounding Him.
\v 20 Then a person told Him, “Sir, your mother, and brothers and sisters are waiting outside. They want to speak to you.”
\p
\v 21 But Jesus said to them, “I consider everyone who hears God's teachings and does them to be my mother, and my brothers and sisters.”
\s Jesus stops a storm
\r (Mat. 8:18, 23-27; Mark 4:35-41)
\p
\v 22 One day, Jesus said to His disciples, “Come, let's cross to the other side of the lake.” So they got into a boat and left.
\v 23 While they were sailing, Jesus fell asleep. Suddenly a stormy wind blew on the lake. A lot of water entered the boat, so that they were in danger and were almost sinking.
\v 24 Then His disciples approached Him and woke Him up, saying, “Teacher, Teacher! We're goners!”
\p Jesus just got up and with a loud voice said to the stormy wind and the waves, “Be quiet!” Then the stormy wind and waves became quiet, and the lake became calm again.
\v 25 Then He said to them, “Why did you doubt Me?!”
\p They were amazed and afraid of Jesus, then said to each other, “Wow, what kind of Man is He?! Even the wind and the lake obey His commands.”
\s Jesus drives demons out of a man from Gerasa
\r (Mat. 8:28-34; Mark 5:1-20)
\p
\v 26 They continued to sail, and reached the region of the city of Gerasa— which is located on the southeast side of Lake Galilee. The man had been naked for a long time, and didn't want to live in a house. He just lived in the caves in the graveyard.\f + \fr 8:27 \fk grave yard \ft At that time, the Jews often buried peoples' bodies in caves, or in small rooms that were dug into a rocky hill. This event talks a lot about unclean things— evil spirits, a graveyard, pigs, and the regions of people who weren't Jewish. All of these things were considered to be unclean by the Jews.\f*
\p
\v 28-29 The evil spirits often dragged the man around. When the people of the city still tried to protect him, his two hands were chained, and his two feet were bound together. But he could always break all of those bonds, then he went to lonely places, under the influence of the demons. When the man met Jesus, he cried out and knelt down in front of Him. Then Jesus ordered the evil spirits to come out of him. And the man said with a loud voice, “Hey, Jesus, Son of Almighty God! What do you want with me? I beg you, don't torture me!”
\p
\v 30 Then Jesus said to him, “What's your name?”
\p He answered, “Battalion.”\f + \fr 8:30 \fk Battalion \ft In the Greek language, his name was “Legion.” At that time, a legion was a military battalion whose total was up to 6826.\f* He answered like that because there were so many demons in him.
\v 31 Then the demons repeatedly begged Jesus not to drive them into the pit of death.
\p
\v 32 Not far from there— there was a large group of domesticated pigs eating, on the side of a steep hill. Then the demons begged Jesus to allow them to enter the pigs. Jesus agreed.
\v 33 And the demons immediately went out of the man and entered those pigs. Then the pigs quickly ran and fell off the edge of the cliff into the lake and were drowned.
\p
\v 34 After the pig herders saw what had happened, they ran and told about that event in the city of Gerasa, and in the region around it.
\v 35 Then the people who heard the news went to see what had happened. When they arrived at the place where Jesus was, they saw the man whom the demons had left, already clothed and sitting calmly near Jesus, listening to Him.\f + \fr 8:35 \fk sitting … listening to Him \ft Literally, “(sitting) at Jesus' feet.” These words were often used with the meaning ‘sitting, listening to a teacher’.\f* His mind was also already sane too. On seeing that, they became afraid of Jesus.
\v 36 And the pig herders, who had seen this happen themselves, told it again to the people who had just come— how the man who was possessed by demons was healed.
\v 37 Then the residents of the region of Gerasa asked Jesus to leave their region, because they were really afraid.
\p For that reason, Jesus and His disciples got back into the boat and left that region.
\v 38 The man who had been set free from the demons repeatedly asked Jesus if he could go along with Him. But Jesus sent the man home saying,
\v 39 “Go home and tell how God has helped you.” The man in fact went to the whole city of Gerasa and told how Jesus had helped him in an extraordinary way.
\s Jesus heals a woman who was sick with a bleeding disorder, and brings Jairus' daughter to life
\r (Mat. 9:1, 18-26; Mark 5:21-43)
\p
\v 40 When Jesus returned from crossing the lake, the crowd welcomed Him, because they were waiting for Him.
\v 41 Then the head of the Jewish synagogue, who was named Jairus, came. He immediately knelt down before Jesus and beggedHim to come to his house,
\v 42 for his only child— who was a girl, was very sick, and almost dead. She was twelve years old.
\p On the way to Jairus' home, the crowd pressed in around Him.
\v 43 There was also a woman there who had suffered from a bleeding disorder for twelve years,\f + \fr 8:43 \fk Verse 43b \ft Several ancient copies in the Greek language add these words: “She had spent all that she owned to be treated by doctors.” It's very likely that these words were taken from Mark 5:26.\f* and couldn't be cured by anyone.
\v 44 Then she approached Jesus from behind and touched the fringe of His robe.\f + \fr 8:44 \fk fringe of His robe \ft Jewish robes had fringes/tassles, as commanded by Moses, as a reminder to follow all of the commands of the Law. See Num. 15:37-41.\f* And at that very moment, her bleeding stopped.
\p
\v 45 Jesus said, “Who touched Me?”
\p When no one wanted to admit it, Peter said, “Teacher, there are many people who are pressing in around You.”
\p
\v 46 But Jesus said, “Someone who touched Me, because I felt power go out from Me.”
\v 47 When the woman saw that what she had done had become known, she came forward shaking and knelt down in front of Him. Then in front of everyone there, she told why she had touched His robe, and how she became well at that very moment.
\v 48 Jesus said to her, “My child, because you've believed in Me, you've become well. Now go home with a calm heart.”
\p
\v 49 While Jesus was still talking to the woman, someone came from Jairus' home and said to him, “Your child has died, Sir. So you don't need to bother the Teacher any more.”
\p
\v 50 But when Jesus heard that, He said to Jairus, “Don't be afraid! Just keep believing in Me and your child will be saved.”
\p
\v 51 After Jesus arrived at Jairus' home, He didn't allow others to enter the house with Him— except Peter, John, James, and the child's mother and father.
\v 52 Everyone was crying and mourning for the child. But Jesus said to them, “Stop crying for her, because she isn't dead! She's just sleeping.”
\p
\v 53 The people laughed at Him because they knew that the girl had already died.
\v 54 But Jesus held the girl's hand and said, “Hey, My child, get up.”
\v 55 The child came alive again, and at that very moment she stood up. Then Jesus ordered the child's parents to give her some food.
\v 56 They were really very amazed at seeing what happened to their child, but Jesus forbid them to tell anyone about it.
