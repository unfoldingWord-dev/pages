\s John the Baptist prepares God's people for Jesus' coming
\r (Mat. 3:1-12; Mark 1:1-8; John 1:19-28)
\p
\v 1-2 When it was the fifteenth year of Tiberius' rule— the high king of the Roman kingdom, God led John— the son of Zechariah, to begin his ministry. At the same time also,
\q1 Pontius Pilate was in the position of governor of the province of Judea;
\q1 Herod ruled as king in the province of Galilee;
\q1 Philip— his brother, was king in the provinces of Iturea and Trachonitis;
\q1 and Lysanius ruled as king in the province of Abilene.
\q1 And in Jerusalem Annas and Caiaphas were in the position of high priest.
\m At that time, God began to give His message through John— who lived in the desert.
\v 3 John went around to the whole region of the Jordan River and announced this, “You each have to repent of your sins so that God will forgive you. And to show that you want to keep following the Lord, come to me so that I can baptize you.”
\v 4 So this John is the one meant by God, in the prophecy of Isaiah's book, where he wrote,
\q1 “Later on there'll be a man who cries out in the desert like this,
\q2 ‘Prepare the way for the coming of the Lord! Make the way straight for Him!’”\x + Is. 40:3\x*
\q1
\v 5 “Every valley should be filled in,
\q2 and every mountain and hill be leveled,
\q1 every road that zig-zags be straightened,
\q2 and every road that is full of holes will be repaired.
\q1
\v 6 In that way, each person will get the opportunity to understand
\q2 how he can be saved by God.”\f + \fr 3:5-6 \fk Quotation from the Prophet Isaiah \ft John quoted Is. 40:3-5. Leveling ground and straightening roads illustrate that everything which hinders the work of the Lord in individual lives should be eliminated.\f*
\p
\v 7 Many people came to John to be baptized. He said to them, “Hey, you descendants of poisonous snakes! Don't think that you can free yourself from the punishment of God which will come!
\v 8 For that reason, show through your deeds that you've sincerely repented. And don't say in your heart, ‘I won't be punished by God because I'm a descendant of Abraham.’ I'm telling you that God is able to change these stones to become descendants of Abraham!
\v 9 Like a farmer who cuts down and burns a tree that never bears fruit, God is also now ready like that to do away with our people and throw them into the fire!”\f + \fr 3:9 \fk Ayat 9 \ft Literally, (with implicit information), “The axe, (which illustrates the punishment of God), has been prepared to chop down the grape vine,(which illustrates the people of Israel), to its roots. Every vine which doesn't produce good fruit will be chopped down and thrown into the fire.” This illustration was natural for John's listeners because of the words of two prophets. In Jer. 2:21, Israel was illustrated as a grape vine which didn't produce good fruit. And in Ezek. 15, Israel was illustrated as a grape vine which wasn't useful because it wasn't faithful to the Lord.\f*
\p
\v 10 Then the crowd asked him, “So what should we do— so that God doesn't punish us?”
\p
\v 11 He answered them, “Whoever of you has two shirts, give one to a person who doesn't have any. If you have food, share it with people who are hungry too.”
\p
\v 12 Some tax collectors\f + \fr 3:12 \fk tax collectors \ft At the time of Jesus, Israel was colonized by the kingdom of Rome. So if a Jew became a tax collector, he was considered to be a person who betrayed his own people. For that reason, the tax collectors were considered to be sinners by all other Jews. They were also hated because they liked to collect more taxes than was correct. Because of that, the tax collectors became rich.\f* came to be baptized. They asked John, “Teacher, what should we do?”
\p
\v 13 He answered them, “Stop collecting more taxes than what's determined by the Roman government.”
\p
\v 14 There were even soldiers who asked him, “And what about us? What should we do?”
\p He answered them, “Don't use force, threats, or false accusations against a person in order to get money from him. Be satisfied with your wages.”
\p
\v 15 Because of John's ministry, people waited full of hope, and asked in their hearts, “Is John the Christ\f + \fr 3:15 \fk Christ \ft See the note in Luke 2:11.\f* whom we're waiting for?”
\p
\v 16 John answered all of them, “I'm baptizing you with water, but a Man will come who has more authority than I do. I'm not worthy to serve Him— not even to untie the strings of His sandals. He'll baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.
\v 17 Repent! For this world is like a field which is ready to be harvested, and the good produce will be separated from what isn't good! For He who's coming after me will judge this world and separate all of you who are evil from among the righteous people. The righteous will live with Him. But all the evil people will be thrown into the fire of hell which will never be extinguished.\f + \fr 3:17 \fk verse 17 \ft Literally (with implicit information) could be translated like this, “The threshing tool and winnowing basket are already in His hands (illustrating punishment from God). After the harvest (everyone in this world), He will use those tools of His to separate the wheat (illustrating good people), from the husks of the wheat and other dirt (illustrating evil people). Then He'll keep the wheat in His storehouse, while He will burn the rest in the fire which will never be extinguished.” What has been translated above as “threshing tool and winnowing basket,” is literally, “cleaning tool”— which is a tool like a shovel or large fork, that's used to separate the wheat from its outer husk. This verse can be compared with Rev. 14:14-20 and Mat. 25:31-46.\f*
\v 18 John told the Good News to the crowd by giving much advice like that .
\s John's work ends
\p
\v 19 John rebuked King Herod because he had taken off with Herodiana— his brother's wife,\f + \fr 3:19 \fk Herodiana … \ft This name is often written in Indonesian translations as 'Herodias'. The spelling Herodiana was chosen so that it's obvious that this is a woman's name.\f* and because he had done other evil things too.
\v 20 Then Herod added even more to his evil deeds by putting John in prison.
\s John baptizes Jesus
\r (Mat. 3:13-17; Mark 1:9-11)
\p
\v 21 While John was baptizing the crowd, he also baptized Jesus. And while Jesus was praying, the sky opened up,
\v 22 and the Holy Spirit came down on Him in the form of a dove. Then a voice from the sky was heard which said, “You're My Son, whom I love very much. And You please My heart.”
