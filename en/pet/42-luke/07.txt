\s Jesus heals a slave
\r (Mat. 8:5-13; John 4:43-54)
\p
\v 1 After Jesus finished teaching all of those things to the crowd, He and His disciples went to the city of Capernaum.
\v 2 There was a Roman officer\f + \fr 7:2 \fk Roman officer \ft Literally in Greek, the word translated as 'officer' means 'leader of one hundred soldiers'.\f* there, who had a slave that was very sick ,and almost dead. That slave was loved deeply by the officer.
\v 3 When the officer heard about Jesus, he sent several Jewish elders to meet Jesus, and ask Him to come to heal his slave.
\v 4 After they met Jesus, they earnestly pleaded with Him to help the officer. They said, “Sir, that man deserves to receive your help,
\v 5 because he loves our people and is generous to us. And he's the one who funded the building of our synagogue.”
\p
\v 6 Then Jesus went with them. When they were almost at the house, the officer sent several of his close friends to meet Jesus with this message, “Sir, you don't need to bother coming to my house. I'm not worthy to receive you in my house, Sir.
\v 7 In fact, I myself feel I'm not worthy to come and meet you, Sir. But I ask that you just say, ‘Be healed,’ and my slave will certainly get well.
\v 8 For I myself am an underling who submits to the commands of a superior, and there are also many soldiers under my command. If I say to one of them, ‘Go there,’ then he goes. And if I say to another, ‘Come here,’ he comes. And if I say to my slave, ‘Do this,’ then he does it. My faith in you is like that also, that all of your commands will happen.”
\p
\v 9 When heard his answer, He was really amazed. Then He said to the crowd who was following Him, “Pay attention to what I'm saying: I've never met someone who has faith as great as this man's faith among the people of Israel.”
\p
\v 10 When those who were sent returned to the officer's house, they found the slave was already well.
\s Jesus brings the son of a widow back to life
\p
\v 11 Not long after that, Jesus went to a village called Nain. His disciples and many other people also went with him on that trip.
\v 12 When Jesus was near the village gate, there was a group of people who were going out, carrying the dead body of a young man.\f + \fr 7:12 \fk young man \ft Literally, “dead man.” The word that Jesus used to call the young man in verse 14 indicates an adult between the ages of 24-40.\f* The young man was the only son of a widow. Many people from that village were with the widow.
\v 13 When the Lord saw the widow, He felt compassion, then said to the woman, “Don't cry.”
\v 14 Then he came close to the stretcher and touched it. Those who carried the stretcher stopped and then He said, “Hey young man, I'm telling you, live again!”
\v 15 And the dead man came alive again and sat up, while beginning to talk. Then Jesus turned him over to his mother.
\p
\v 16 Everyone who was there was very amazed and afraid, while praising God. There were those who said, “Obviously this Jesus is a great prophet who has been sent by God into our midst!” And there were others who said, “God has begun to help us— His people, like in times past!”
\p
\v 17 So the news about what Jesus had done spread to all Judea and the region around it.
\s John the Baptist presents a question, and Jesus teaches about the ministry of John
\r (Mat. 11:2-19)
\p
\v 18 The John the Baptist's disciples told all of those things to John. Then John called two of his disciples,
\v 19 and sent them to meet the Lord to ask, “Sir, are You the Messenger whose coming was promised? Or should we still wait for another person?”
\p
\v 20 After they met Jesus they said, “Sir, John the Baptist ordered us to meet You to ask, ‘Are You the Messenger whose coming was promised? Or should we wait for another person?’”
\p
\v 21 At the time, Jesus was healing many people from various diseases and sufferings, driving evil spirits out of people who were possessed, and making many blind people able to see.
\v 22 So Jesus answered them, “Go back to John and tell what you yourselves have witnessed and heard today— which is that now many blind people can see, lame people walk, people with contagious skin diseases are healed, deaf people can hear, dead people are being raised up, and the Good News from God is being told to poor people.
\v 23 And tell John that everyone who isn't disappointed in Me or doesn't doubt Me is truly blessed.”
\p
\v 24 After John's two messengers left, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John. He said, “Before My ministry began, why did you often travel far out into the desert? Was it just to see something normal— like seeing a blade of grass moving because the wind blows? Certainly not!
\v 25 What were you actually looking for at that time? You certainly didn't go to see a person who was beautifully dressed. For people who live luxuriously and wear clothing like that aren't in the desert, but in a king's palace.
\v 26 So what did you look for there? A prophet— right?! Yes, I'm telling you that the status of John is far more important than a prophet.
\v 27 For he's the one who was meant by the verse in the Holy Bible which says,
\q1 ‘Pay attention: I will send My messenger first,
\q2 so that he'll prepare the way before I send You.’\x + Mal. 3:1\x*
\m
\v 28 What I'm telling you is true: John is greater than everyone who has ever been born. But in the new kingdom which God has begun to set up, everyone who becomes a citizen of His kingdom will be considered greater than John— even those of the lowest status.
\p
\v 29 Most of the crowd who heard those words of Jesus— including the tax collectors, praised God by saying, “If that's so, God truly sent John the Baptist, and what John taught was also true!” For they had obeyed God's will when they were baptized by John.
\v 30 But the Pharisees and the Law experts disregarded God's will for themselves when they refused to be baptized by John.
\p
\v 31 Jesus said, “I will use an example to illustrate most of the people who live in this age:
\v 32 They're like two groups of children playing in a yard. One of the groups calls to the other group,
\q1 ‘Every time we invite you to play something, you still don't want to! If we play a dance tune with a flute,
\q2 you don't want to dance.
\q1 But if we pretend that we're mourning,
\q2 you don't want to pretend you're crying.’
\m
\v 33 It means this: You always reject the work of God— whatever its form. For when John the Baptist was serving the Lord among you, he often fasted and didn't drink strong drinks. But you said, ‘He's demon possessed.’
\v 34 Then the Son of Man— who I am, came too, and I eat and drink strong drinks like people in general. But you say, ‘Look! He eats and drinks greedily! He's also a friend of tax collectors and other sinful people.’
\v 35 Even so, the wisdom of God is always proven to be true through its results.”
\s When Jesus is anointed by a prostitute woman
\p
\v 36 Then a Pharisee named Simon invited Jesus to eat with him at his house. So Jesus went and took His place at the dinner table.
\p
\v 37 In that city, there was a prostitute woman. When that woman heard that Jesus was eating at Simon's home, she came to the house bringing a very beautiful bottle\f + \fr 7:37 \fk very beautiful bottle \ft Literally, “made of allabaster (stone).” The bottle which was made of white stone was bought for an expensive price, and the oil inside the bottle was also expensive.\f* which was filled with fragrant oil.
\v 38 As Simon and the guests were eating, the woman came and knelt behind Jesus— near His feet while crying with regret for her sins. The woman's tears fell and and made His feet wet, then she wiped Jesus' feet with her hair. Then the woman repeatedly kissed and anointed His feet with that fragrant oil.
\p
\v 39 When Simon— the Pharisee, saw that, he said in his heart, “If Jesus really was a prophet, he would certainly know what kind of woman is touching him! This woman is a prostitute!”
\p
\v 40 Then Jesus said to him, “Simon, I want to tell you something.”
\p Simon answered, “Say it, Teacher!”
\p
\v 41 Then Jesus told this parable: “There were two men who were in debt to a man who often loaned money with interest. The one man owed five hundred silver coins, whereas the other man owed fifty silver coins.\f + \fr 7:41 \fk silver coins \ft Literally, 'denarius'. In Roman times, a denarius was made of pure silver. The value of a denarius was the same as the wages of a worker for one full day.\f*
\v 42 Because the two men weren't able to pay their debts, then the lender generously erased their debts. Which of the two men will love him more?”
\p
\v 43 Simon answered, “In my opinion, the person with the larger debt that was erased.”
\p Jesus said to Simon, “Your opinion is correct.”
\v 44 While looking at the woman, Jesus said to Simon, “You.ve seen what this woman has been doing, of course! When I entered your house, you didn't give Me water to wash My feet. But this woman washed My feet with her tears and dried them with her hair.
\v 45 When I entered your house, you didn't give a warm greeting to Me.\f + \fr 7:45 \fk give a warm greeting … \ft Literally, “kiss Me.” Kissing people who came to visit one's house was a Jewish custom.\f* But since I came in here, this woman hasn't stopped kissing My feet.
\v 46 You didn't anoint My head with olive oil, but she anointed My feet with fragrant oil.
\v 47 Because of that, I say to you that her sins— which are many, have been forgiven. And that's why she showed her love for Me in such an extraordinary way. But a person who has just a few sins forgiven, loves just a little too.”
\p
\v 48 Then Jesus said to the woman, “I've forgiven your sins.”
\p
\v 49 Then the other guests who were eating together there began to say in their hearts, “He's too bold saying that! No one may forgive man's sins except God Himself.”\f + \fr 7:49 \fk too bold … \ft Literally, “Who's this person that he dares to forgive sins?” This rhetorical question is translated as a statement according to its meaning.\f*
\p
\v 50 But Jesus said to the woman again, “It's because you believe in Me that you've been saved. Go with the feeling of calm under God's protection.”
