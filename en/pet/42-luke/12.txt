\s Fear and respect God— not man
\r (Matt. 10:19-20, 26-31; 12:31-32; 16:6; Mark 3:28-29; 8:15, 38; 13:11)
\p
\v 1 Then thousands of people gathered and pressed around Jesus, so that people's feet were stepped on. Then Jesus began to teach, mainly His disciples, by saying, “Be careful! Don't be affected by the yeast of the Pharisee group— which is doing things to pretend to be good people.
\v 2 Everything that man tries to hide now, at some later day will be revealed. And everything that man tries to keep secret now, at some later time will become known.
\v 3 So what each of you tell others secretly will be heard clearly. And what you whisper to another person in a private room will be broadcast everywhere.
\p
\v 4 “My good friends, I'm telling you, don't be afraid of men, because they can only kill your body. After that, there isn't any other evil thing that they can do to you.
\v 5 But now I'm telling you whom you should fear: Fear and respect God. He's the One who has the power not only to kill your body, but has the authority to throw you into hell too. Yes, He's the One you should fear and respect!
\p
\v 6 “Remember this example: Five sparrows are sold for the price of two coins of the smallest value. Even so, not one of them will ever be forgotten by God.
\v 7 For that reason, don't be afraid! You're far more valuable than many sparrows— in fact, the Lord knows the number of hairs on your heads.”
\p
\v 8 “Whoever admits that he's My follower before other people, I, as the Son of Man, will also admit he's My follower before the angels in heaven.
\v 9 But whoever denies that he's My follower before other people, I won't admit that he's My follower before the angels in heaven either.
\v 10 Everyone who says something that opposes the Son of Man— who I am, can still be forgiven. But a person who insults the Holy Spirit\f + \fr 12:10 \fk insults the Holy Spirit \ft Jesus advises them about the sin of insulting the Holy Spirit because the Pharisees had said, “Jesus works by the power of the devil.” (Luke 11:15) Their hearts were so closed to Jesus, that they considered the good things which were done by Him through the power of God's Spirit to be evil. So, people who think like that can't possibly repent. This means it's as if they're insulting God's Spirit because of the hardness of their hearts. Their situation can be compared with 1 John 5:16— where John writes about “the sin which brings death,” which can't be forgiven either. But for us Christians now, we don't need to be afraid thinking, “Have I ever insulted God's Spirit and God won't forgive me anymore?” If our hearts still have feelings of sadness, and we still want to ask the Lord to forgive us when we fall into sin, and if we still want to live well in the eyes of God, it's clear that God's Spirit is still working in our hearts. That means that we haven't yet committed the sin of insultingGod's Spirit.\f* will never be forgiven.
\p
\v 11 “When you're arrested and brought to face the leaders of the synagogues, or government officials, don't worry about how you should defend yourself before them, or how you'll answer all of their questions.
\v 12 For at that very moment, the Holy Spirit will tell you what you should say.”
\s The parable of a rich man
\p
\v 13 Then a man in the crowd said to Jesus, “Teacher, please order my brother to share the inheritance with me, which was left by our father.”
\p
\v 14 But Jesus said to him, “I've never been appointed to be a judge over our people group, or a mediator to settle the case between you two.”
\v 15 Then he said to them, “Beware and be on guard! Don't be greedy— either for money or for treasures. For your life doesn't depend on just money or rich possessions.”
\p
\v 16 Then Jesus told this parable, “There was a rich man who owned a number of wheat fields that produced huge crops.
\v 17 Then he thought, ‘There isn't enough space anymore to keep all of my great harvest. What should I do?’
\p
\v 18 “Then he thought some more: ‘I know what I'll do! I'll tear down my old wheat barns and build even bigger barns, so that I can keep all my wheat and my other possessions.
\v 19 After that I'll be satisfied and say, “My wealth is so great and it won't be used up as long as I live. So I don't need to work anymore, but can just eat, drink, and be happy!”’
\p
\v 20 “But God said to him, ‘Hey, you stupid person! How useless for you to pile up possessions for yourself alone, because this very night I will take your life!’
\p
\v 21 “The same thing will happen to everyone who gathers rich treasures for himself in this world, but doesn't try to gather heavenly treasure, and doesn't want to be rich in God's sight.”
\s Put God's kingdom first
\r (Matt. 6:19-21, 25-34)
\p
\v 22 Then Jesus said to His disciples, “For that reason I'm telling you: Don't worry about the daily needs of life— like food and clothing.
\v 23 For the direction of your life\f + \fr 12:23 \fk direction your life \ft What Jesus meant is revealed in verse 31.\f* is actually far more important than the problem of food and clothing.
\v 24 Pay attention to the way of life of the ravens. They don't need to plant, or harvest, and don't need to build storehouses or barns. But God prepares food for those birds. So know this: In the eyes of God, you're far more valuable than those birds!
\v 25 Why are you always worried?! For the person who worries isn't even able to add just one minute to his age.
\v 26 So, if you aren't able to do such a little thing, then it's no use for you to worry about anything at all!
\p
\v 27 “Pay attention to the wild flowers. Those flowers grow without working and without making clothes for themselves. But I'm telling you the truth: King Solomon— even though he was the richest of all kings who've ever lived, didn't wear clothing as beautiful as even one of those flowers.
\v 28 If God gives beauty like that to wild flowers— even though those plants just live briefly, then wilt and are thrown into the fire, then God certainly pays more attention to you than to those plants. And He'll also give you clothing— oh you who are lacking faith!
\v 29 So, don't be anxious about what you'll eat or drink,
\v 30 because those who don't know God are always worried about those things. But our Father who's in heaven knows that you need all those things.
\v 31 For that reason, live in a way that's proper for citizens of God's kingdom, and everything that you need will be given to you too.”
\s How we should live while waiting for God's kingdom
\r (Matt. 6:20-21, 24:45-51)
\p
\v 32 “Hey, all of you followers of Mine, don't worry— even though you're like a small flock of My sheep in My sight! Don't worry, because our heavenly Father will gladly welcome each of you as citizens of His kingdom.
\v 33 Sell all your possessions, and donate the money to poor people. In that way, you'll prepare rich treasures for yourselves that won't ever rot— that is heavenly treasures that won't ever run out. Your treasures will be safe there, because thieves can't steal them, and moths can't destroy them.
\v 34 For where your treasure is, your heart and thoughts will be there too.
\p
\v 35-36 “You should always be ready to serve God! You should be like servants who are waiting for their master to come home from a wedding feast. They're always ready to welcome him, day and night, with lamps that remain lit. In that way, when the master arrives home and knocks on the door, they're ready, and quickly open the door for him.
\v 37 The servants whose master finds them on guard when he returns are truly blessed! What I'm telling you is true: The master will invite them to sit and eat. Then he himself will put on ordinary clothes, like a servant, and will serve them.
\v 38 Those servants will be even more blessed if the master comes in the middle of the night, or in the dark hours of the morning, and still finds them on guard!
\p
\v 39 “And remember this example: If the master of the house knows what time a thief will come, he'll always be ready, so that the thief can't manage to break into his house.
\v 40 It's the same with you! You should keep ready, because I— the Son of Man, will come at a moment you don't expect.”
\s The parable about the faithful servant and the unfaithful servant
\r (Matt. 24:45-51, 25:29)
\p
\v 41 Then Peter asked “Lord, in the last parable, did You mean that the servants who have to stay on guard are only us disciples of Yours, or all of Your followers?”
\p
\v 42 The Lord answered, “Become a servant who's faithful and wise, because before his Master goes on a long trip, his Master will raise up a servant like that and entrust him with a special task— which is to give food to the other servants at the right time.\f + \fr 12:42-48 \fk his Master … \ft After Jesus' explanation in verse 40 and Peter's question in 41, Jesus still uses figurative language as in 35-39, but now it's clear that He's the ‘Master’ that's meant here.\f*
\v 43 If his Master comes suddenly and finds him still doing his job, the Master will be very happy with his servant and bless him.
\v 44 What I'm telling you is true: His Master will entrust all of his possessions to the servant who's wise and faithful.
\p
\v 45 “Whereas if the servant says in his heart, ‘My Master won't return for a long time yet,’ then he begins to beat the other servants— both men and women. And he doesn't work anymore, but just eats and drinks until drunk.
\v 46 But without giving notice ahead of time, and on a day and hour which isn't expected, his Master suddenly comes home. Then the Master of the evil servant will destroy him, and make his fate the same as the people who refuse to believe in Him.
\p
\v 47 “Every servant who knows his Master's will and doesn't prepare himself or do the will of his Master, will be beaten many times.
\v 48 But every servant who doesn't know the will of his Master and does something wrong, will be beaten just a few times. Every servant who's entrusted by his Master to undertake many things will be examined in regard to all of his responsibilities. And every servant who's given great responsibility, will be held accountable for that great responsibility.”
\s Troubles that will be experienced as followers of Jesus
\r (Matt. 10:34-36)
\p
\v 49 “My coming to this world can be illustrated by fire— that is a fire which will burn this world.\f + \fr 12:49 \fk fire … \ft The illustration of fire in this verse is often interpreted in three ways, and Jesus intent may include all three things. 1) Fire illustrates the battle which will happen in the world because of Jesus, as is seen in verse 51. 2) Fire illustrates the way God will make His people holy through Jesus. 3) Fire also illustrates God's punishment of people who reject believing in Jesus.\f*How good it would be if that fire was already hot!
\v 50 But before that happens, it has been destined that I will bear great troubles.\f + \fr 12:50 \fk bear great troubles \ft Literally, “I have to be baptized with a baptism.”\f* And until the time comes when I experience that, My heart is very distressed!
\v 51 Don't think that I came to this earth to bring peace. I'm telling you the truth: I'm not bringing peace! But My coming actually brings much opposition.
\v 52 For from now on, there will be opposition toward Me among families. If a family consists of five people, then three people will oppose two other people, or two people will oppose the other three people— in agreement with what was prophesied in the Holy Bible:
\q1
\v 53 ‘A son and his father will oppose each other,
\q2 a daughter and her mother will oppose each other,
\q1 and a daughter-in-law and her mother-in-law will oppose each other.’”\x + Mic. 7:6\x*
\s We are responsible to pay attention to the signs of the time
\r (Matt. 16:2-3)
\p
\v 54 On another day, Jesus also used this example when teaching a crowd, “When you see a dark cloud appear in the west, you say, ‘Oh, it will rain soon,’ and of course that happens.
\v 55 And when the wind blows from the south, you say, ‘It'll be hot today,’ and of course that happens.
\v 56 Hey, you who only pretend to be good! You can predict the weather by just looking at the sky and the land, so why're you blind about the signs of the times that are happening now?!”
\s Make peace with God, because He's ready to judge
\r (Matt. 5:25-26)
\p
\v 57 “And why don't each of you open your own eyes and choose the right path?!
\v 58 If your enemy brings a case against you to court, then while you two are still on the way to the courtroom, try hard to settle your problem with him. If not, he'll drag you into the court, then the judge will hand you over to the jailer so that you'll be imprisioned.
\v 59 I'm telling you the truth: You won't get out of prison until you pay all of your debts in full, and pay the fines which the judge has determined!”
