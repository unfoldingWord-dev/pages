\s Jesus comes back to life
\r (Matt. 28:1-10; Mark 16:1-8: John 20:1-10)
\p
\v 1 Early in the morning, on the first day of that week, those women went to Jesus' tomb, taking fragrant spices and perfumed oils which they had prepared.
\v 2 After arriving there, they found that the stone closing the tomb had been rolled away.
\v 3 After entering the tomb, they didn't find the body of the Lord Jesus there.
\v 4 While they were still confused about what had happened, two angels suddenly appeared who stood near them. The two of them looked like men with shining clothes.
\v 5 The women knelt down in worship, full of fear, with their faces on the ground. Then the two said to them, “You don't need to look for the Man who's alive in the place of dead people!
\v 6 Jesus isn't here any longer. He's alive again. Remember what He told you while you were still with Him in Galilee—
\v 7 which was, 'In order that the prophecies of the prophets be fulfilled, the Son of Man— who I am, will be turned over to the hands of sinful people, die by crucifixion, and will come back to life on the third day.’”\x Luke 18:31-34\x*
\v 8 Then they remembered Jesus' words.
\p
\v 9 So they left the tomb and went to tell His eleven disciples and all of the other followers all that had happened.
\v 10 The women were Mary, from the village of Magdala, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and other women. They were the ones who told Jesus' apostles\f + \fr 24:10 \fk apostles … \ft See the footnote at Luke 6:13.\f*— that is His disciples, the things that had happened.
\v 11 But for His disciples, the news seemed like empty talk. They didn't believe what the women told them.
\v 12 Even so, Peter got up and ran to the tomb. While stooping, he looked into the tomb and only saw the cloth shroud that had been wrapped around His body. Then he went home in amazement, wondering in his heart what had happened.
\s Jesus shows Himself to two of His followers on the way to Emmaus
\r (Mark 16:12-13)
\p
\v 13 On the same day, two of Jesus' followers were on a trip to the village of Emmaus, which was a distance of approximately eleven kilometers\f + \fr 24:13 \fk eleven kilometers \ft Literally, “sixty stadion.”\f* from Jerusalem.
\v 14 While walking, they talked about everything that had happened.
\v 15 And while they were talking and exchanging thoughts about those events, Jesus Himself came near to them, and walked with them.
\v 16 Of course the two of them saw Him, but it was as if there was something that prevented them from recognizing Him.
\p
\v 17 Then Jesus asked them, “What are you discussing with each other on this trip?”
\p Then with sad faces they just stopped walking.
\v 18 One of them, whose name was Cleopas answered, “Sir, you may be the only foreigner in Jerusalem who doesn't yet know about the events that happened these past few days.”
\p
\v 19 Then He said again, “What's it all about?”
\p They answered, “About Jesus the Nazarene. He was proven to be a prophet who was powerful in his words and deeds— both before God and before all people.
\v 20 But the chief priests and the members of our Religious Court turned him over to the Roman rulers to be sentenced to death, and then he was crucified.
\v 21 However, before that, we had hoped that he was the one who would free us Israelites from the colonization of the Roman kingdom. Obviously, he wasn't the King of Salvation we've been waiting for, because today is the third day since those events happened.
\v 22 And also earlier this morning, there were some women from our group who shocked us, because they went to the tomb early in the morning,
\v 23 but they didn't find his body there. Then they came back and told us that they saw two angels in a vision. And the two angels said that Jesus had come back to life.
\v 24 Then some of our close friends also went to the tomb, and as it turns out, they didn't see the body of Jesus there either— just like the women had said.”
\p
\v 25 Then Jesus said to the two of them, “Wow! How can you two not yet understand and find it so hard to believe every prophecy of the prophets!
\v 26 You should know that before the Christ could enter His glory, it was determined that He would suffer first.”
\v 27 Then Jesus explained everything that was written in the Holy Bible about Himself— beginning with the books of Moses, through all of the books of the prophets.
\p
\v 28 It was late afternoon when the three of them approached the village of Emmaus. Jesus acted as if He wanted to continue His trip.
\v 29 But the two men pressured Him by saying, “Stay with us ,because the sun has almost set and it's getting dark.” Then Jesus went with them into the village as if He intended to stay overnight with them.
\p
\v 30 When they sat down to eat together, He took bread and gave thanks to God for the bread. Then He tore the bread and gave it to them.
\v 31 At that very moment, their eyes were suddenly opened and they recognized Jesus. But immediately He was no longer seen by them.
\v 32 Then the two men talked about what had happened and said, “Oh, our spirits really burned while He spoke on the way earlier, and explained the contents of the Holy Bible to us!”
\p
\v 33 And at that very moment— even though it was already night, they got up and returned to Jerusalem. There they met His eleven disciples gathered with the other followers of Jesus.
\v 34 Then those who were in Jerusalem told the two followers, “The Lord Jesus really has come back to life and has shown Himself to Peter!”\f + \fr 24:34 \fk Peter \ft Literally, “Simon.”\f*
\v 35 Then the two followers also told those in Jerusalem what they had experienced while they were on their way to Emmaus, and how they recognized Jesus when He tore the bread.
\s Jesus shows Himself to His followers
\r (Matt. 8:16-20; Mark 16:14-18; John 20:19-23; Acts 1:6-8)
\p
\v 36 While the two followers were still talking about those things, Jesus suddenly stood among them and greeted them saying, “May you feel calm at heart!”\f + \fr 24:36 \fk gave a greeting … \ft Jesus literally said two words in the Greek language that mean, “Well-being to you.” It's most likely that Jesus used the Hebrew language when giving this greeting— which is 'Shalom'. In the Hebrew language, 'Shalom' is a word of greeting used every day. But of course in this situation, it's most likely that Jesus also meant the root meaning of that word— which is calmness of heart.\f*
\p
\v 37 They were all shocked and afraid, because they thought they were seeing a ghost.
\v 38 But Jesus said to them, “You don't need to be shocked and doubt!
\v 39 It's Me, Myself! See My two hands and My two feet! Touch them and see for yourselves. I have bones and flesh, so I'm not a ghost!”
\p
\v 40 After saying that, Jesus showed His two hands and His two feet to them.
\v 41 But they still didn't yet completely believe because they were so joyful and surprised to see Jesus. For that reason Jesus said to them, “Do you have any food here?”
\v 42 Then they gave Him a piece of roasted fish.
\v 43 He took it, and ate it in front of them all.
\p
\v 44 Then He said to them, “Now I'll repeat what I said to you while I was still with you, ‘All of the prophesies that were written about Me in the books of the Law of Moses, the books of the prophets, and the book of Psalms had to be fulfilled.’”
\p
\v 45 Then Jesus enlightened their thinking so they could understand the contents of the Holy Bible.
\v 46 Then He said to them, “This is what was prophesied in the Holy Bible about Me: ‘According to God's plan, the Christ will suffer and on the third day will come back to life from death.
\v 47 Then My messengers will announce the news of salvation to every people group— starting in Jerusalem, so that they repent and their sins are forgiven.’
\v 48 You're the ones who've become eyewitnesses, whom I will send to tell about all of those things.
\v 49 And I will send you Him who was promised by My Father.\x John 14:26, 15:26, 16:7; Acts 1:4\x* Stay in this city until God equips you with power from heaven.”
\s Jesus is raised up to heaven
\r (Mark 16:19-20; Acts 1:9-11)
\p
\v 50 Then He invited them to go out of the city of Jerusalem, and they all went near Bethany. Then He raised His two hands to bless them.
\v 51 While He was blessing them, He was separated from them, and was raised up to heaven.
\v 52 They all bowed down worshipping Him, then returned to Jerusalem full of joy.
\v 53 They were always praising God, and because of that they hardly ever left the courtyard of God's Temple.
