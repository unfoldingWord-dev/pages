\s Jesus' teaching about how to pray
\r (Mat. 6:9-15)
\p
\v 1 One day, Jesus was praying in a certain place. After He finished praying, one of His disciples said, “Lord, teach us to pray, like John also taught his disciples.”
\p
\v 2 Jesus said to them, “You should pray like this:
\q1 ‘Our\f + \fr 11:2 \fk our \ft Because Jesus uses 'our' in this example of prayer, the reader might think that this prayer is only to be used to pray together in a church service. That idea is wrong. Jesus and God the Father certainly gladly receive our prayers when we pray following this example and adapt it to whoever is praying. So you may pray, “My Father,” and “Forgive me for all of my sins…” and so forth.\f* Father, may everyone honor You\f + \fr 11:2 \fk You \ft Literally, “Your name.” According to the Jewish culture at the time of Jesus, 'Your name' meant the whole identity of God.\f* as Holy God.
\q2 May You come and rule as King.
\q1
\v 3 Give us the food that we need each day.
\q1
\v 4 And forgive each of us of our sins,
\q2 because we also forgive everyone who does wrong to us.
\q1 And don't let us be tempted to do evil.’”
\s Jesus' advice to be diligent in prayer
\r (Mat. 7:7-11)
\p
\v 5 Then Jesus gave this example to them, “For example, if you have a close friend, and in the middle of the night you go to his house and say to him, ‘Friend, give me three pieces of bread. I'll repay you later,
\v 6 because a close friend of mine who's on a trip has come to my house. But I don't have anything to serve him.’
\v 7 And if your close friend answers from inside his house, ‘Please don't bother me! The door is locked. My children and I are in bed. I can't get up to give you anything! ’
\v 8 I'm telling you the truth, even though that close friend of yours doesn't want to get up to give you bread based on the relationship between the two of you, yet because you keep on shamelessly asking, then he'll get up and give you whatever you need.
\p
\v 9 “For that reason I'm telling you, keep on asking God, then you'll receive it. Keep seeking, then you'll find it. Keep knocking on the door, then the door will be opened up for you.
\v 10 For everyone who asks diligently, will receive what he asks for. Everyone who seeks diligently, will find what he's seeking. And for everyone who knocks on the door, the door will be opened up for him.
\p
\v 11 Or if you're a father, and your child asks for a fish, you would'nt give him a poisonous snake— would you?!
\v 12 Or if he asks for an egg, you would'nt give him a scorpion— would you?!
\v 13 So if you who are evil know how to give what's good to your children, your Father in heaven will do so even more! He'll even give the Holy Spirit to everyone who asks Him.”
\s According to what people say, Jesus works by the power of the devil
\r (Mat. 12:22-30; Mark 3:20-30)
\p
\v 14 One day Jesus drove out a demon who made a man unable to speak. When the demon went out, the man could speak. Then the crowd who saw that happen was amazed.
\v 15 But some of the people among them said, “The devil— the leader of all types of evil spirits, who's also called Beelzebul,\f + \fr 12:24 \fk Beelzebul \ft is another name for Lucifer or the devil— that is the leader of all types of evil spirits including demons.\f* gives power to Jesus so that he can drive out demons.”
\p
\v 16 And some other people looked for a reason to find fault with Him, so they ordered Him to do a miraculous sign to prove that God had sent Him.\f + \fr 11:16 \fk to prove… sent Him \ft Literally, a miraculous sign “from heaven.” In the Jewish culture, 'heaven' was used to avoid expressing 'God' in a direct way.\f*
\v 17-18 But Jesus knew what they were thinking. So He said to them, “The devil wouldn't possibly drive out the spirits who are on his side. If the devil's cohorts split up and oppose each other, the devil's kingdom will be destroyed. It's the same with a country. If the residents of a country oppose each other and make war, it means that the country will be destroyed. It's the same if a split up happens between family members too. So it doesn't make sense if you say that I\f + \fr 11:17 \fk I \ft Jesus is speaking to people opposing Him. The Greek language doesn't differentiate between first person pronouns like Indonesian does. See the explanation about this in the Preface.\f* drive out demons by the power of Beelzebul.
\v 19 But if it's true that I drive out demons by the power of the devil, that means we have to ask, ‘By whose power do other members of your group drive out demons?’ Your members will certainly say that your accusation of Me is wrong.
\v 20 But if I drive out demons by the power of God, it means that God has already begun to set up His kingdom among you, with full power.
\p
\v 21-22 “The devil can be illustrated as a strong home owner who always guards his house fully armed. He trusts in his weapons to keep all his possessions safe, and to defeat the One who opposes him— which is Me. But I'm stronger than he is! When I attack him, I will certainly defeat him, take all of his weapons, carry away his possessions and distribute them according to My will.
\p
\v 23 “Whoever isn't on My side, opposes Me. And whoever doesn't help shepherd the flock of sheep, scatters them.”
\s A warning about people who oppose Jesus
\r (Mat. 12:43-45)
\p
\v 24 “Remember this example: If an evil spirit leaves a person, the spirit is forced to look for another person here and there— even going into the desert so that it can enter the person, because the evil spirit wants to enter someone so that it can be calm. When it doesn't succeed in finding someone else whom it can enter, then it thinks, ‘I'll just return to the person I left the other day.’
\v 25 When it returns, it finds that the person has become like a house that has been swept clean and is neatly organized.
\v 26 So it goes and invites seven other spirits, that are more evil than itself, to join with it. When they enter and possess that person, the situation of that person becomes much worse than the situation before.”\f + \fr 11:26 \fk Verse 24-26 \ft Mat. 12:45 adds a sentence which shows the meaning of this lesson to those who opposed Jesus: “The same thing will happen to you who live in this evil age too.” The interpretation of these verses is also that when a demon is driven out of a person, that person can't allow himself to be empty, like an empty house that isn't lived in. It means that if he doesn't invite God's Spirit to live in him, then evil spirits will enter him again, for sure.\f*
\s People who are truly blessed
\p
\v 27 While Jesus was speaking about those things, a woman from among the crowd shouted to Him, “Your mother is truly blessed by God because she gave birth to you!”\f + \fr 11:27 \fk your mother \ft Literally, “The womb that carried you and the breasts that nursed you.”\f*
\p
\v 28 But He said, “The people who hear God's Word and do it are far more blessed!”
\s The miraculous sign that will be given to the people of this evil age
\r (Mat. 12:38-42; Mark 8:12)
\p
\v 29 While more and more people were gathering, Jesus said, “You people who live in this age are so evil! Even though you've seen everything that I've done, you keep saying that you need a miraculous sign in order to believe in Me. But no sign at all will be given to you except this sign— the miraculous sign like what happened to the Prophet Jonah.\f + \fr 11:29 \fk Prophet Jonah \ft The story about the Prophet Jonah is in the book of Jonah, in the Old Testament. Jonah was sent by God to the city of Nineveh.\f*
\v 30 For just like what happened to Jonah became a miraculous sign to the residents of Nineveh, so also what happens to the Son of Man— who I am, will become a miraculous sign for each of you who live in this age now.\f + \fr 12:30 \fk Verse 30 \ft The meaning of this verse is explained in Mat. 12:40.\f*
\p
\v 31 And on the Judgment Day, the queen of the south\f + \fr 11:31 \fk queen of the south \ft That is the queen of the the country of Sheba, who traveled the distance of 1,500 kilometers to learn the wisdom which God had given to King Solomon. This story is in 1Kings 10:1-13.\f* will stand to testify against most of you who live in this age now. For that queen came from a very distant place to study the wisdom of Solomon. Pay attention, I— who am greater than Solomon, am here in front of you! But most of you don't want to listen to Me.
\p
\v 32 On the Judgment Day, the residents of the city of Nineveh will stand to testify against most of you who live in this present age. Because when Jonah told God's message to them, they repented. Even though I— who am greater than Jonah, am here, you still don't want to repent.”
\s Guard your spiritual eyes so that they remain open to the light
\r (Mat. 5:15: 6:22-24)
\p
\v 33 “No one lights a lamp, and then hides it, or covers it with a clay pot. But a lamp is always put in a high place, so that it gives light to everyone who comes into the house.
\v 34 Your eyes are like windows through which light enters the house— which is your body. If your eyes function well, then each part of your life will be given light. But if your eyes are bad,\f + \fr 11:34 \fk eyes are bad \ft Literally, “your eyes are evil/diseased.” Jesus was speaking to the Jewish leaders— including the members of the Pharisees and the Law experts. In the context of this chapter, we see that they have seen many miracles which prove that Jesus was sent by God, but it's as if they've become blind to all of those miracles (11:29-30)— in fact, they say that He worked by the devil's power. Bad eyes are also frequently interpreted as meaning greedy for money— as in Mat. 6:19-24. See Luke 16:14 too.\f* not every part of your life will be given light, and will become very dark.
\v 35 For that reason, beware! Don't let the light inside you become dark.
\v 36 So if the eyes of your heart aren't blind, your whole life will become very bright and no longer dark. This means that your life is light like the light of a very bright lamp.”
\s Jesus teaches not to copy the deeds of the Law experts
\r (Mat. 15:1-3, 23:1-36; Mark 12:38-40; Luke 20:45-47)
\p
\v 37 After He gave His teaching, a Pharisee invited Jesus to eat at his house. Then Jesus entered the man's house and ate with him, and also with other Pharisees and some of the Law experts.\f + \fr 11:37 \fk him and other Pharisees… \ft This verse doesn't literally mention “and also with other Pharisees and some of the Law experts.” According to what's natural in Indonesian, the others who were present are written at the beginning of this story— in agreement with the information found in verses 45 and 53.\f*
\v 38 The Pharisee was amazed when he saw that Jesus didn't wash His hands first according to the custom of the Pharisees.\f + \fr 11:38 \fk wash hands … custom of the Pharisees \ft Literally, “baptize (hands).” This custom wasn't written in the Old Testament, and evidently was only done by the Pharisees. They dipped their hands into water, or a servant poured water over their hands. So it wasn't like what's usually done by people now— which is washing hands using soap. This was done as a religious requirement. See Mark 7:3-4.\f*
\v 39 But the Lord said to him, “The way you Pharisees follow God's commands can be illustrated by a person who only washes the outside of a cup and plate, but forgets to wash the inside, which is very dirty. In the same way, each of your hearts are full of filth— which is various greedy thoughts and evil desires!
\v 40 Hey you stupid people! The One who created the outside of man also knows what's in your hearts!
\v 41 So distribute your wealth— which has taken control of you, to poor people, and only then will you be like a clean cup in the eyes of God— both on the inside and outside.
\p
\v 42 “You Pharisees are so unfortunate! You just follow all of the easier regulations of the Law, but forget to do the most important commands of God. For example, each of you gives ten percent of the harvest of garden herbs — such as basil, rue, and other kinds of spice crops, to God's Temple.\f + \fr 11:42 \fk ten percent … \ft The Law of Moses stated that the Jews give ten percent of the food produce of their fields. (Lev. 27:30-32; Deut. 26:12). This didn't include small plants such as those named in this verse. This meant that the Pharisees had given more than what was demanded by the Law, to show how extremely they kept the Law.\f* But you forget to follow the most important commands of God— that is doing what's just to your fellowman, and loving God. You should do the most important things, and don't forget to do the easy things either.
\p
\v 43 “You Pharisees are so unfortunate! You like to sit in the front row seats of the synagogues, and like to receive respectful greetings from people while walking in the market.
\v 44 You're so unfortunate, because each of you are like unmarked graves! People who walk over those graves don't realize that they've become unclean because of touching those graves. It's the same way with you: When others follow you, without realizing it they're infected by your character, which is like uncleanness in God's eyes.”\f + \fr 11:44 \fk People … \ft Literally, “and people who walk on top of them aren't aware that they've walked on top of graves.” In the TSI translation, information from the Jewish culture which was understood by the first readers has been added to help readers of today's time. Compare to Mat. 23:27-28. See Num. 19:11-20.\f*
\p
\v 45 Then a Law expert said to Jesus, “Teacher, when you say things like that to the Pharisees, you make us embarrassed too!”
\p
\v 46 He said, “You Law experts are so unfortunate too! You burden other people with religious regulations that are so difficult to follow. But you yourselves only pretend to be good people, and don't even try to follow those regulations.
\v 47 You're so unfortunate, because you rebuild and decorate the graves of the prophets, even though it's your own forefathers who killed them!
\v 48 In that way, you show that you actually approve of the deeds of your forefathers. They were the ones who killed the prophets, and you return and rebuild the graves of those prophets.
\p
\v 49 “For that reason, from long ago God, in His wisdom, had decided, ‘I will repeatedly send prophets and apostles to the Jews. And that hard-headed people group will kill some of them and torture others.’
\v 50-51 As a result, God has also decided now to lay the worst punishment on you Jewish people because of the blood of all of His messengers whom you've killed. You who are living now, and have witnessed My ministry, will bear the punishment for all the murders of the prophets of all history— beginning with the murder of Abel until the murder of Zechariah!\f + \fr 11:51 \fk Abel … Zechariah \ft Abel was the very first person who was murdered in the Old Testament, and Zechariah was the last person murdered. (Gen. 4:8; 2 Chr. 24:21)\f* (Zechariah was the man killed between the Holy Room and the altar in God's Temple.)
\p
\v 52 “You Law experts are so unfortunate! You've been given the knowledge of how people can please God— that is teaching that can be illustrated as a key. But you yourselves don't use that teaching! In fact you hide it, and hinder everyone who wants to learn that teaching!”
\p
\v 53 After Jesus left that place, the Pharisees and Law experts held a huge grudge against Him, so they often pressed Him with various questions.
\v 54 They pretended to listen to His teaching, but they actually wanted to trap Him. If Jesus taught something wrong, they planned to accuse Him before the Jewish leaders.
