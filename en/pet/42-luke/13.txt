\c 13
\s Repent
\p
\v 1 At the time Jesus was teaching these things, there were people present who told Jesus about some people from the province of Galilee who were killed by Pilate. They were killed while they were offering animal sacrifices to God, and their own blood was mixed with the blood from the animal sacrifices which they were offering.
\v 2 On hearing that news, Jesus said to them, “So because they were killed like that, do you think that their sins were more than the sins of all the othe Galileans?
\v 3 That's not so! I'm telling each of youthe truth: If you don't repent, you won't just experience a disaster like them but you'll go to hell!
\v 4 Or for another example, when the guard tower of Siloam collapsed, and eighteen people were crushed to death, you probably think that their sins were more than the sins of all the other people of Jerusalem.
\v 5 That's not so at all! I'm telling all of you the truth again: If you don't repent, you won't just experience a disaster like them, but you'll go to hell!”
\s The parable about the fig tree that's slow to bear fruit
\p
\v 6 Then Jesus told this parable, “A man who owned a fig tree, which was planted in his vineyard, and he had come several times to look for fruit on the tree, but there was none.
\v 7 So he said to his gardener, ‘Look, I've come looking for fruit on this fig tree for three years, yet there has never been any. For that reason chop it down. There's no use in this tree growing on this land.
\p
\v 8 “But the gardener answered, ‘Sir, let the tree grow for one more year. I'll dig up the ground around it and bury fertilizer from the pen there.
\v 9 Hopefully the tree will bear fruit next year. If not, we'll just chop it down.’”
\s On the Sabbath Day Jesus heals a woman who has a hunched back
\p
\v 10 One Sabbath Day, Jesus was teaching in a synagogue.
\v 11 There was a woman there who for had been hunch-backed for eighteen years, and couldn't stand upright anymore. An evil spirit made her sick like that.
\v 12 When He saw the woman, Jesus invited her to come to him and said, “Ma'am, you've been healed of your sickness.”
\v 13 Then He put His hand on the woman. She quickly stood upright and praised God.
\p
\v 14 But the leader of the synagogue was angry because Jesus healed a sick person on the Sabbath Day. So the leader said to the crowd, “There are six days to work. For that reason, come on those days to be healed, not on the Sabbath Day!”
\p
\v 15 But the Lord said to him, “Hey, you people who only pretend to be good! Each of you unties your cow or donkey from its stall everyday, and takes it to let it drink— even on the Sabbath Day.
\v 16 This woman is a descendant of Abraham who has suffered because of the work of a demon— as if being bound with an iron chain, for eighteen years. It certainly isn't wrong to release her from her suffering— even though today is the Sabbath Day!”
\v 17 When Jesus said that, all those who were opposing Him were ashamed. Whereas all the other people rejoiced because of the amazing things which He had done.
\s The parables about a mustard seed and yeast
\r (Matt. 13:31-33; Mark 4:30-32)
\p
\v 18 Jesus said, “In order to make it even clearer, I'm giving you two parables which illustrate God's kingdom.
\v 19 God's kingdom is like a mustard seed.\f + \fr 13:19 \fk sawi (mustard) seed \ft The sawi, or sesawi plant which grows in the land of Israel isn't like the sawi that's known in Indonesia. Sawi in Indonesia can't “become as big as a tree” and birds can't “nest in its branches” either. What's important in this parable is that something which starts out very small, will grow to become very big. That's what's compared to God's kingdom.\f* There was a mustard seed that someone took and planted in his garden, then the seed grew until it became a tree, and the birds of the air made nests in its branches.”
\p
\v 20 Jesus said again, “I will also illustrate God's kingdom like this:
\v 21 God's kingdom is like yeast which is mixed into a large amount of flour by a woman.\f + \fr 13:33 \fk large amount \ft Literally, “three sata.” One sata is the same as thirteen liters.\f* Even though it was a small amount of yeast and the mixture of flour was great, yet the flour expanded so that it was made into bread.”
\s Enter through the narrow gate
\r (Matt. 7:13-14, 21-23)
\p
\v 22 Jesus continued His trip heading to Jerusalem through cities and villages. He gave His teaching in every place He passed.
\v 23 Then a person asked Him, “Lord, will only a few people be saved?”
\p Jesus said to everyone there,
\v 24 “Keep on trying so that each of you enters God's kingdom through the narrow gate. I'm telling you the truth: Many people will try to enter there, but won't be able to do it.
\v 25 On a later day, the Owner of the house— who I am, will close the door of My house— which is the opportunity to enter God's kingdom. All of you who are still standing outside will begin knocking on the door, saying, ‘Sir, please open the door for me.’ But I will tell you, ‘I've never said that you were My close friend.’
\v 26 Then you'll say, ‘But, Sir, I ate and drank with You. I've also heard Your teaching in our city streets!’
\v 27 And I will say to you, ‘I've never said that you were My close friend. Hey, you and all who do evil, go away from My presence!’
\p
\v 28 “You'll cry and suffer terribly outside there,\f + \fr 13:28 \fk suffer terribly \ft Literally, “grind teeth.”\f* when you see Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, along with all the prophets, enjoying eternal life in God's kingdom, while you yourselves are forbidden to enter.
\v 29 And many non-Jews will come from the east, west, north and south too. Then they'll all join in celebrating the opening feast of God's kingdom.
\v 30 And know this: People who have a low status now, will have a high status later on. And people who have a high status now, will have a low status later on.”
\s Jesus feels compassion for the residents of Jerusalem
\r (Matt. 23:37-39)
\p
\v 31 At the same time, some Pharisees came to Jesus and said, “Go away and leave this place, because King Herod wants to kill you.”
\p
\v 32 Then Jesus said to them, “Go and tell that jungle dog,\f + \fr 13:32 \fk jungle dog \ft Herod was illustrated here as a fox, because according to Jewish thinking, a person who was tricky was like a fox.\f* ‘Today and tomorrow I will carry out My job to drive out demons and heal sick people. And My duties will be finished on the third day.’
\v 33 But today, tomorrow and the next day, I will continue to carry out this job of Mine until I arrive in Jerusalem, because it's not proper for Me to be killed in some other city, since prophets are always killed in Jerusalem.
\p
\v 34 “Hey, you residents of Jerusalem: You're the ones who always kill the prophets and God's messengers who come and prophesy in the name of My Father! There are those you kill with the sword, and those you stone to death. I've often stretched out My hands to hug you and protect you— like a mother hen gathers and protects her chicks under her wings. But you don't want Me to hug you.
\v 35 Remember this: The time has almost come when God will no longer live there in His Temple. Believe Me that from now on, you won't see Me again until the moment I return and you say, ‘Blessed is our King who comes to represent the Lord!’”\x + Ps. 118:26\x*
