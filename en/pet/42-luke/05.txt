\s Peter, James and John follow Jesus
\r (Mat. 4:18-22; Mark 1:16-20)
\p
\v 1 One day, Jesus stood on the shore of Lake Galilee,\f + \fr 5:1 \fk Lake Galilee \ft Luke wrote the second name for the same lake— namely “Gennesaret.”\f* and many people gathered and pushed against each other around Him, because they wanted to hear His teaching about God's Word.
\v 2 He saw two boats on the edge of the shore. The fishermen had gotten out of the boats and were cleaning their nets.
\v 3 Jesus got into one of those boats— which was Simon's boat. He suggested to Simon to push a little farther from the shore so there was a little distance. Then He sat in the boat and taught the crowd from there.
\p
\v 4 After He finished teaching, He said to Simon, “Move this boat to a deeper place. Then spread out your nets there to catch fish.”
\p
\v 5 Simon answered Him, “Teacher, we've worked hard all night long and didn't get anything. But since You say so, I'll spread out our nets.”
\v 6 When they did that, they got so many fish that their nets almost broke.
\v 7 Then they called their friends who had another boat to come help. So their friends came with that boat and helped them put the fish into the two boats until they were full, and about to sink.
\p
\v 8 After Simon Peter saw that, he knelt down in front of Jesus and said, “Lord, leave me, because I'm a sinful man.”
\v 9 He said that because he, and everyone with him, was amazed at seeing the number of fish they caught.
\v 10 Simon's coworkers— James and John, the sons of Zebedee, were also amazed.
\p Then Jesus said to Simon, “Don't be afraid! From now on you won't be catching fish anymore, but I will teach you to catch people so that they become My followers.
\p
\v 11 After they pulled their boats to the shore of the lake, they left everything and followed Him.
\s Jesus heals a man suffering from a contagious skin desease
\r (Mat. 8:1-4; Mark 1:40-45)
\p
\v 12 One day, Jesus was in a city. There was a man living there whose body was covered with a contageous skin disease.\f + \fr 5:12 \fk contageous skin disease \ft The skin disease that was meant was not the same as the disease that is now called “leprosy.” Also, in Jesus' time, there was no treatment that could heal contagious skin diseases. According to the Law, everyone suffering from a skin disease like that was considered unclean. They couldn't get close to healthy people, couldn't enter the Jewish synagogues, and had to live outside of the village or city. See Lev. 13.\f* When he saw Jesus, he knelt down to worship Him and begged, “Sir! If you want to, You're able to heal me.”
\p
\v 13 Jesus stretched out His hand and touched him, while saying, “I want to. Be healed!” At that very moment his disease disappeared.
\v 14 Then Jesus said, “Don't tell anyone at all what happened, but go and show yourself to the priest. And offer the sacrifice for your healing— like what was commanded by Moses.\f + \fr 5:14 \fk like what was commanded by Moses \ft What Moses wrote about the healing of skin diseases is found in Lev. 14:1-32. If the priest agreed that a person was healed, that person had to bring two live birds to God's Temple, so that the priests there could do the cleansing ceremony for the skin disease. One bird was cut over a plate which was full of water, so that its blood mixed with the water. Then the person was sprinkled with the water mixed with blood. (And the bird's body was probably burned on the altar of the Lord.) The second bird was dipped into the water mixed with blood and set free. In this story, Jesus meant that the person who was healed had to go to God's Temple in Jerusalem, because offerings like this weren't done in the village synagogues.\f* Do that as proof to everyone that you're well.”
\p
\v 15 But the news about Jesus spread farther, so that a crowd came thronging to hear Him and asking to be healed of their sicknesses.
\v 16 But He often went alone to a quiet place to pray.
\s Jesus heals a paralyzed man
\r (Mat. 9:1-8; Mark 2:1-12)
\p
\v 17 One day, Jesus was teaching a crowd, and there were also men there from the religious group called the Pharisees\f + \fr 5:17 \fk group… Pharisees \ft this was a group of Jews who always maintained that all of Moses' rules, and all the rules added by the Jewish forefathers had to be followed carefully. Because of that, many of them bragged like this, “We're the ones who really are pleasing in God's sight.” For that reason also, most of them weren't happy with Jesus, because He didn't join their group, and they were jealous because many people followed Him.\f* and some Law experts.\f + \fr 5:17 \fk Law experts \ft See the footnote at Luke 2:46.\f* Those religious leaders had come from every city in the provinces of Galilee and Judea, and from the city of Jerusalem. On that day the power of God was on Jesus to heal sick people.
\v 18 Then several people came bringing a totally paralyzed man who was lying on his mattress. They tried to bring him inside and place him before Jesus.
\v 19 But they couldn't bring him inside because of the crowd that was there. So they climbed up on the roof of the house, opened up the roof, and lowered the paralyzed man with his mattress into the middle of the crowd— right in front of Jesus.
\v 20 When Jesus noticed that they believed completely that He had power to heal the paralyzed man, He said, “Brother, I've forgiven your sins.”
\p
\v 21 The Law experts and the Pharisees began to say in their hearts, “This man is too daring to say that! He has insulted God! No man can forgive the sins of man— except God Himself.”\f + \fr 5:21 \fk Too daring … \ft Literally, “Who is this person? He insults God! Who has the right to forgive sin except God?” These two rhetorical questions are translated as obvious statements according to their meaning.\f*
\p
\v 22 At that very moment, Jesus knew what they were thinking. So He rebuked them, “I know that you have doubts in your hearts about what I said!
\v 23 Of course it was hard for you to accept it when I said to this paralyzed man, ‘I've forgiven your sins.’ Will it be easier for you to accept if I say to him, ‘Get up, pick up your mattress and go home’?
\v 24 But by saying this, I'm proving to you that I— as the Son of Man,\f + \fr 5:24 \fk Son of Man \ft When Jesus lived on earth, He often called Himself the “Son of Man.” But the meaning of this term is not directed at the word ‘son’. In the Hebrew language, ‘son of man’ means ‘normal human being’. Jesus called Himself that to remind his listeners about what the Prophet Daniel had witnessed in a vision of the King of Salvation. (Dan. 7:13-14) For Daniel saw Him in heaven in the form of a ‘son of man’— meaning in the form of a ‘normal human being’, when God appointed Him King over everything. In this translation, ‘who I am’ or ‘I/me’ is often added so that it's clear that Jesus was speaking about Himself.\f* have the right to forgive the sin of man!” Then Jesus said to the paralyzed man, “Get up, pick up your mattress and go to your house!”
\p
\v 25 At that very moment, the man stood up in front of them. He took his mattress, then went home while praising God.
\v 26 Everyone was very amazed and praised God. Full of respect and fear for God, they said, “Today we have witnessed extraordinary things!”
\s Matthew follows Jesus
\r (Mat. 9:9-13; Mark 2:13-17)
\p
\v 27 After that, Jesus went out and saw a government official who was sitting in his office. The job of the man was to collect taxes\f + \fr 5:27 \fk collect taxes \ft See note in Luke 3:12.\f* from the people to give to the Roman government. His name was Matthew.\f + \fr 5:27 \fk Matthew \ft Luke writes another name for Matthew— which is “Levi.” We know him better now as Matthew, like it's written in Mat. 9:9-13, 10:3.\f* Jesus said to him, “Come, and follow Me.”
\v 28 Matthew just stood, left everything in his office, and followed Jesus on the way.
\p
\v 29 Matthew held a big dinner for Jesus at Law experts complained to His disciples, “Why do you eat with tax collectors and other sinful people?”
\p
\v 31 Jesus answered them, “People who are healthy don't need to go to a doctor. Those who need to go to a doctor are sick people.
\v 32 It's the same with Me. I came to call sinful people to repent— not people who think that they are righteous!”
\s Regarding fasting
\r (Mat. 9:14-17; Mark 2:18-22)
\p
\v 33 Then there were people who said to Jesus, “The John's disciples often pray and fast. The members of the Pharisee group do too. But your disciples keep eating and drinking.”
\p
\v 34 Jesus answered by giving an example that shows a similarity, “Of course the guests at a wedding feast are never ordered to fast as long as the groom is still with them! In the same way, as long as I'm with My disciples, they won't fast.
\v 35 But just think what will happen if the groom is captured by His enemies. That's what will happen to Me, and at that time My disciples will fast.”
\p
\v 36 Jesus also gave these two examples to them: “If a person has an old tunic that's torn, there's no way he would patch it with cloth taken from a new tunic, because he doesn't want to ruin the new tunic, and the new cloth won't work to patch the old tunic.
\v 37 It's the same with new wine.\f + \fr 5:37 \fk new wine \ft When grapes are first pressed, the grape juice is called new wine and tastes sweet. New wine that's kept for a certain time experiences the process of fermentation. The longer the wine is kept, the higher the content of alcohol will be. In Bible times, what was called 'new wine' could contain alcohol, but not as high a content as old wine.\f* There's no way new wine would be put into an old skin bag. For when the wine expands and the gas can't get out, the bag will break. In the end, the wine will spill out, and the skin bag will just be thrown away.
\v 38 Because of that, new wine has to be put into a skin bag which is also new.
\v 39 But a person who has tasted old wine won't want to drink new wine anymore, because he'll say, ‘The old wine tastes better.’”\f + \fr 5:36-39 \fk Verses 36-39 \ft In these two examples, Jesus compares something old with something new. And this lesson was given when He was asked about the tradition of the Jewish forefathers regarding fasting. Like new cloth and new wine, Jesus' teachings can't be made one with the old teachings of the forefathers.\f*
