\s Be united and pay attention to each other
\p
\v 1 So because of all that, my Brothers and Sisters, think about the things that we experience together because we're one with Christ! He always strengthens and comforts us, because He loves us. And we enjoy a relationship as brothers and sisters because the Holy Spirit lives in each of us. For that reason, we pay attention to each other and love each other. Now, based on all of that,
\v 2 I urge you to make me more joyful when I hear that you live like-minded, still having the same love for each other, and working together with one heart and one mind.
\v 3 Whatever each of you does, you must not prioritize your won self-importance or promote yourself. But put the importance of every brother in the faith over your own self-importance and continue to be humble.
\v 4 Don't just be busy thinking about your own needs, but think about the needs of other people too.
\s Follow the example of Christ who wasn't self-centered
\p
\v 5 So we should each follow the attitude of Christ Jesus!
\q1
\v 6 Even though Jesus had all of the character traits of God,
\q2 yet He never thought that His status as God
\q2 was something that He had to continually hold onto.
\q1
\v 7 But He humbled Himself and left everything.
\q2 Then He took the lowliest status of a servant to serve us,
\q2 and came to this world as a normal human being.
\q1 And as a human being,
\q2
\v 8 He humbled Himself even more to obey the will of God,
\q2 so that He surrendered His body to die—
\q2 even to die by crucifixion.
\q1
\v 9 For that reason, God has raised Him up to the most honored place,
\q2 and elevated Him above all other authorities!\f + \fr 2:9 \fk elevated Him … \ft Literally, “gave Him a name above all names.” According to Jewish culture at the time of Paul, ‘name’ meant the whole identity of Christ Jesus.\f*
\q1
\v 10 God did that, so that everyone—
\q2 whether in heaven, on earth, or in the world of the dead,
\q2 will kneel to worship Jesus.
\q1
\v 11 And everyone\f + \fr 2:11 \fk everyone \ft Literally, “every tongue.” Here the tongue illustrates the whole person's identity. The meaning here is that the tongue alone, but the the heart and mind also confess.\f* will confess that Christ Jesus is Lord.
\q2 In that way, God the Father will also be glorified.
\s Become the people that God desires
\p
\v 12 For that reason, my Brothers and Sisters whom I love, just like you've always obeyed me, so now I urge you to try to live according to what's proper for people who've been saved by God— with fear and respect for Him. Don't do this just when I'm with you, but it's even better if you do this when I'm not with you.
\v 13 For God is the one who gives the desire and even the ability to each of us to do the things that please His heart.
\p
\v 14 Do everything without complaining and arguing.
\v 15-16 In that way, you're worthy to be called God's children, because you live pure and without stain, being clean from all wrong— even though you're among people who've gone astray and have rotten hearts. And because you tell them the teaching that gives life, you should shine among them like stars which shine in a dark world. That way, I will really rejoice when Christ returns, because it will be proven that my effort and struggle were not worthless.
\p
\v 17 You completely believe in Him, so you've sacrificed your lives to serve God. So even if I must give my own blood along with your sacrifice— meaning if I am killed because of continuing to fight for our faith in Christ,\f + \fr 2:17 \fk give my blood … \ft This phrase translates one word which can be translated “pour out wine as a sacrificial offering.” Animal sacrifices made according to the Law almost always included offerings of flour mixed with olive oil and about two liters of wine— which was poured out a little at a time on top of the sacrificial meat which was burning on the altar until it was gone. See Ex. 29:38-41; Num. 15:1-12. Paul didn't mean that his blood would truly be an offering, but in this way he illustrated that he was willing be killed in a horrible way for their sakes— to defend the Good News which they believed. Compare with 2 Tim. 4:6.\f* I will still be happy! And I want you to feel that joy along with me too.
\v 18 Yes, join in being happy with me and be full of joy with me!
\s News about Timothy and Epaphroditus
\p
\v 19 I hope that the Lord Jesus will soon open up a way to send Timothy to you. For I will really rejoice when he returns bringing news about you.
\v 20 For I don't have any other coworker like Timothy— who's of one heart with me, and who truly thinks about your needs.
\v 21 For other people think more about their own self importance, and don't really care about the work of Christ Jesus.
\v 22 And you also know Timothy’s character, that he has served with me in telling the Good News— like a son helps his father.
\v 23 For that reaso, I hope to send Timothy to you soon, when I know more about my case.
\v 24 And I'm sure that the Lord will help me, so that I myself can soon come to you.
\p
\v 25 But I feel it's necessary to send Epaphroditus back to you. He's my good brother in the faith, a coworker and warrior in the service of the Lord. Of course, you sent him earlier to take care of my needs in this prison.
\v 26 But my reason for sending him back is because he himself really longs to see all of you. He's worried because he knows that you know he was sick.
\v 27 He was very sick for sure, and almost died, but God had compassion on him and helped him. God didn't just have compassion on him but on me too— so that I was really comforted.
\v 28 So I'm happy to be able to send him back to you. In that way, you'll be glad to see him again, and I won't need to worry about his health any more.
\v 29 So welcome him joyfully as a brother who's also one with the Lord. And honor people like him,
\v 30 because he almost died in the task of serving Christ. He was willing to die in order to fulfill the task that you gave him when you sent him— which was to take care of my needs while here in prison.
