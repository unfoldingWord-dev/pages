\p
\v 1 Dear Brothers and Sisters in Philippi— that is to everyone who has been purified by God because of oneness with Christ Jesus, especially to all the elders and church workers:
\p Greetings from Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus.
\p
\v 2 Our prayer is that God, the Father, and our Lord Christ Jesus, will always be kind to each of you and guard you so that you live calmly under our Father's and the Lord's protection!
\s Paul’s prayer
\p
\v 3 Every time I remember to pray for you, I always thank God whom I serve.
\v 4 I always pray for all of you with gladness,
\v 5 because I remember how you worked with me in telling the Good News about Christ from the time you believed that news until now.
\v 6 And I'm sure that God, who has begun a wonderful spiritual work in each of you, will continue it until it's perfect, on the day Christ Jesus returns.
\p
\v 7 It's proper for me to think like that about you, of course, because I feel that you have a place in my heart. That's because you've become my coworkers in the task that God has given me. That task was given to me only because of His kindness. My task is to defend and maintain the Good News from God, whether I'm in prison or not. And God Himself knows that I really long for all of you with the love that comes from Christ Jesus.
\p
\v 9 So this is my prayer for you:
\q I pray for all of you that your love will increase more and more,
\q and that your love will be supplied with wisdom and true understanding,
\q
\v 10 so that you'll know which way is best,
\q and in that way, your life will become truly perfect and pure from all wrong on the day of Christ’s return.
\q
\v 11 And I pray that your lives which are righteous in God’s eyes, will produce many good things—that is things that are done through the power of Christ Jesus for the glory and praise of God.
\s Paul’s suffering makes the Good News spread more and more
\p
\v 12 Brothers and Sisters, I want you to know that all the trouble and suffering that I'm experiencing has actually caused the Good News about Christ to spread more and more,
\v 13 so that everyone here— especially the guards of the Roman palace, already know clearly that I'm in prison because I'm a follower of Christ.
\v 14 And because I'm imprisoned, most of our brothers and sisters who believe in the Lord Jesus are getting bolder to tell the Good News about Him.
\p
\v 15 Of course, there are some people who tell about Christ because they're envious of me, or because they want to become more well-known than me. But most of the brothers and sisters in the faith tell the News because they sincerely want to please the Lord.
\v 16 They do it because they love me too, and are aware that I'm in prison because of God's will— which is to fight to defend and maintain the Good News from God.
\v 17 But some other people still tell about Christ because of selfish reasons, and not with sincere hearts. They each think, “Let Paul have more trouble when he hears that I have more followers here than he has.”
\p
\v 18 But it doesn't bother me if they boast about themselves like that! Because what's important to me is that the news of Christ spreads far— whether it's done for pure reasons or not. So I'm still rejoicing. Yes, and I will keep on rejoicing!
\v 19 For through your prayers and the help of the Spirit of Christ Jesus, I'm sure that in the end I'll be released.
\s The goal of Paul’s life is to glorify Christ alone
\p
\v 20 For I truly long for and hope that I won't fail in my task, and won't be ashamed before the Lord. I want to be able to witness full of boldness— like I've witnessed before now. In that way, I hope that Christ is always glorified by what happens to me— whether dead or alive.
\v 21 Because for me, this life is only to glorify Christ. And if I die, that will just bring benefit to me— which is to live with Christ.
\v 22 But if I keep living in this world, I'll keep trying to get more results in my service to the Lord. So, if I were given permission to choose, I don't know if I would be happier to live or to die soon.
\v 23 It's very difficult for me to choose between the two, of course! Personally, it's better for me to leave this body and live with Christ. Yes, that's far better for me!
\v 24 But remembering that you still need me, I'm certain that I still need to live longer in this world.
\v 25 Because I'm sure of that, I think that the Lord will allow me to live and remain with you. In that way, I will help you grow more and more, and rejoice because of our faith in Christ—
\v 26 so that when I come to you again, you'll be very happy for sure and be thankful to Christ Jesus.
\s Be united and continue to live as citizens of the kingdom of Heaven
\p
\v 27 But whatever happens to me, the most important thing is that you keep living according to the Good News about Christ— that is in a way that's proper for citizens of the kingdom of God. In that way— whether I come and see you, or only hear news about you, I will know that with one heart and mind you keep enduring and fighting for our faith in the Good News.
\v 28 Don't be afraid of the people who oppose you. That will prove to them that they'll be destroyed, whereas God Himself will save us.
\v 29 God chose you because of His kindness— not only to believe in Christ, but also to suffer for His glory!
\v 30 And the suffering which you are experiencing is the same as the suffering I experience— like what you have witnessed, and you have also heard that I am still suffering until now.
