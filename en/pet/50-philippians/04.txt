\s Final advice
\p
\v 1 Because of that, Brothers and Sisters whom I love and long for, I ask each of you to remain one with the Lord! Stand firm, because you're my joy and the result of my ministry that I'm very proud of.
\p
\v 2 I ask our two sisters— Euodia and Syntyche, to be like-minded because of being one with the Lord.
\v 3 I ask my faithful coworker— who's the leader of the church,\f + \fr 4:3 \fk coworker … \ft Paul used a word that can be translated “coworker,” or it has also been considered to be a person's name, Sisigus. This word is singular, and it's likely that the man intended was a leader or an elder in the church.\f* to help those two sisters of ours. For I remember how those two served and fought with Klemens, myself, and other brothers and sisters, in telling the Good News. Their names are found in the book of life, for sure!\f + \fr 4:3 \fk book of life \ft is God's book that contains all the names of people who've been chosen by God to enter eternal life (Rev. 3:5; 21:27). Because of the way Paul mentions “their names are found in the book of life,” it's quite likely that some of them— particularly Klemens, have already died.\f*
\p
\v 4 Rejoice always, because you're one with the Lord! Yes, I'm not embarrassed to repeat it: Once again I order you, keep on rejoicing!
\p
\v 5 Let it be obvious through each of your lives that you're always gentle. The Lord will come soon!
\v 6 Don't worry about anything, but pray about everything. Give your requests to God in prayer, and don't forget to give thanks.
\v 7 In that way, the calmness in God's protections that we receive because of oneness with Christ Jesus will guard your hearts and minds. That calmness which was given by God is more than any human can understand.
\p
\v 8 Finally, Brothers and Sisters, focus your thoughts on true teachings and whatever is worthy to be praised— that is everything that's good, things that lead to righteous and honorable living, and things that are pure, lovely and pleasing.
\v 9 And do all of the teachings that you've received from me— both through my words and through my deeds. In that way, God— who's the source of our calmness of heart, will be with you.
\s Expressions of thanks from Paul to the church in Philippi
\p
\v 10 The Lord has given me amazing joy because you obviously still remember me being imprisoned here, by sending assistance again. Of course, you always care about my situation, but you haven't usually had the opportunity to help.
\v 11 I'm not saying that because I still need something, for I've been trained to feel content in every situation.
\v 12 So I know how to satisfy myself— whether I'm living with little or with plenty. For I've found the secret of how to feel content in every situation— full or hungry, rich or poor.
\v 13 I can face every situation because Christ always gives me strength!
\v 14 Even so, I'm glad and am thankful that you've helped me in the trouble I'm experiencing right now.
\p
\v 15 Of course you know that the first time I left you in Macedonia to tell the Good News in another place, there was no other church that was fully involved— that is who became close coworkers of mine and received blessings too because of repeatedly giving financial support to me. You're the only ones who supported me like that.
\v 16 And when I served in Thessalonica, you sent help to me several times to meet my needs.
\v 17 I'm not saying this to seek help from you again. But I want each of you to be blessed abundantly because you've saved up treasure in heaven.
\v 18 All of my needs have been met in full— in fact, I have more than what I need because Epaphroditus has brought your contribution to me. To God, that gift of yours is like a fragrant offering, and He has received that offering and is pleased with it.
\v 19 The God whom I serve will reimburse it by meeting all of your needs too, because He'll abundantly give all spiritual riches— that is the glories of heaven, to us who are one with Christ Jesus.
\v 20 Glory to our God and Father forever. Amen!
\p
\v 21 Give my greetings to all of the brothers and sisters there— that is to everyone who has been purified by God because they're one with Christ Jesus. The brothers who are with me send greetings to you.
\v 22 And all of our brothers and sisters here who've been purified by God send greetings to you too— especially those who have duties in the high king's palace.
\p
\v 23 I pray that our Lord Christ Jesus will always be kind to you, and be with each of you.
