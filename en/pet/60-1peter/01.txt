\v 1 Dear brothers and sisters in the faith who were chosen by God:
\p Greetings from Peter, an apostle of Christ Jesus.
\p I'm writing this letter especially to you who, because you believe in Jesus, were persecuted so that you were forced to leave the province of Judea. So now you live as foreigners in several different provinces in the Roman kingdom— namely Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia.
\v 2 According to God's plan from the beginning, He has chosen you, to be purified through the work of the Holy Spirit. And spiritually, through the Holy Spirit and by the blood\f + \fr 1:2 \fk by the blood … given a sign \ft Literally, “sprinkled with blood.”\f* of Christ Jesus, you were given a sign that you've become possessions of God. And because of that, you've become people who obey God.
\p I pray that God will always be kind to each of you and watch over you so that you live calmly under the Lord's protection!
\s Our hope is in Jesus who lives
\p
\v 3 Praise God, the Father of our Lord Christ Jesus! Because of His amazing mercy, He has given us new life through His Son, who came back to life from death— so that we have hope that's certain, based on Jesus who came back to life.
\v 4 And our hope is to receive all the blessings that God has prepared for us, His children. All of those blessings are kept in heaven, and they can't be ruined or spoiled, and their beauty will never fade.
\v 5 Because you've believed in Jesus, God, with His great power, keeps guarding you until you reach the salvation which God has prepared for us, and which is ready to be revealed to us on the last day.
\p
\v 6 So our hope makes us very joyful, even though for awhile there are many opportunities to feel sad. For in the will of the Lord, we're experiencing many kinds of difficulties.
\v 7 In this way, the Lord is allowing us to be tested, to prove whether we sincerely believe in Christ, or not. Our faith can be compared to gold, which is also tested and purified by burning in fire. However, gold doesn't endure forever either. So the faith we possess is more valuable than gold, because that's what will make us receive honor, praise and glory when Christ Jesus reveals Himself on the last day.
\v 8 You, of course, have not yet seen Jesus, but you already love Him. Even though you can't see Him now, yet you still believe in Him. For that reason, you feel very joyful to the extent that it can't be explained with any words. And your feeling of joy is full of glory that comes from heaven.
\v 9 You're happy because it's clear that we who believe in Christ Jesus will reach what we hope for— which is to have eternal life.
\p
\v 10 The prophets in times past tried diligently and carefully to understand more about how humans are saved. Even though they didn't understand completely, they still kept telling the news of salvation from God— that we're saved only because of God's kindness.
\v 11 Those prophets wanted to know, of course, “Who's the King of Salvation that will come?” And, “When will those things happen?” They asked about the prophetic news that was given by the Holy Spirit, who was within them, “When the Christ comes later on, why is He appointed to suffer so much before He's glorified?”
\v 12 But the Holy Spirit only answered that the news about God's plan wasn't for they themselves. But actually, they were working to serve us, to prove the truth that we've heard through the Good News. Now the Holy Spirit has been sent from heaven, and with the power of His Spirit, that Good News has been given to us, including the news about God's plan. In fact, the angels in heaven desire to know more in depth about those things.
\s A call to live holy lives
\p
\v 13-14 So get ready! Be on guard, and control yourselves. And put your hope completely in God the Father, who'll show His kindness to us when Christ Jesus reveals Himself to us. So we should live like children of our Father, who obey Him. Let's not slide back again to satisfy our old desires. When we lived like that, we didn't yet know God.
\v 15 But now we should be holy in all our actions, just like God who has called us is holy.
\v 16 For it's written in the Lord's Word, “You should live holy, because I'm holy.”\x + Lev. 11:44, 45; 19:2; 20:7\x*
\p
\v 17 We ought to remember that He, whom we call “Father”, when we pray, doesn't discriminate between people. He'll judge all of us according to our own deeds. So we should live with respect and fear of Him, as long as we live like foreigners on this earth.
\v 18 For we know that God has paid in full, in order to free us from our worthless lives that we inherited from our forefathers. And that payment wasn't made using the things of this world— like gold and silver. For all of those can be ruined.
\v 19 But the payment that was used to free us is far more valuable, which is the blood of Christ— who was offered like a sacrificial lamb without any defect or blemish.
\v 20 Christ's work was determined by God before this world was created, but He has only recently revealed Himself so that we could be saved. Christ's coming shows that the final age of this world has begun.
\v 21 So through Christ, we believe in God, who has brought Him to life from death and given Him glory. For that reason we believe and put all of our hope completely in God.
\p
\v 22 When we surrendered ourselves to follow true teaching, we were cleansed from our sins. That enables us to love each other as brothers and sisters in our faith, with sincere hearts. So let's really love each other with all our hearts.
\v 23 For we've become new people. We've been born again because of receiving God's Word, and that Word grows in our hearts. God's Word can't be destroyed, but continues to be valid forever.
\v 24 This agrees with what's written in the Holy Bible:
\q1 “Every human is just like grass
\q2 which quickly wilts and dies.
\q1 And the glory of humans is like wild flowers,
\q2 which quickly fall off and fade.
\q1
\v 25 But God's Word remains valid forever.”\x + Is. 40:6-8\x*
\m And of course the Good News which was given to you is included in God's Word which ‘remains valid’!
