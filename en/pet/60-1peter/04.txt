\s Advice to live to glorify God
\p
\v 1 So, we need to remember that Christ suffered for us when He lived as a normal human being in this world. For that reason we should also encourage ourselves by thinking thoughts like Christ's. For anyone who suffers because of following Jesus has also decided to stop sinning.
\v 2 In that way, for the rest of the time you live in this world, you won't live with worldly human desires anymore, but according to the will of God.
\v 3 For before following Jesus, we had already wasted a lot of time in living as worldly people who didn't know God! So we don't need to live like those who are involved in all kinds of immoral sins and follow all the desires of the body anymore, drunkenness, taking part in sex parties and drinking parties, and doing filthy things in worshipping idols.
\p
\v 4 People who still chase their desires here and there are surprised by us and think, “Why don't they join us anymore?” Because of that, they insult us.
\v 5 But before long, they'll each have to give an account for their wickedness. For God is now prepared to judge everyone— both those who've already died, as well as those who are still alive.
\v 6 That's why the Good News was given by Christ to those spirits in the world of the dead. Let that be a warning to us all: God will judge all of us according to what we have done. But the Good News has been given so that we can live with God forever.
\s The way to use the abilities which we receive from God
\p
\v 7 The last day of this world is already near. For that reason, we should control ourselves and guard our thoughts so that we're always ready to pray.
\v 8 But the most important thing of all is that we must sincerely love each other. For the trait of loving each other motivates us to forgive each other.
\v 9 And if a brother in the faith needs a place to stay, I hope that you're always ready to receive him in your home without complaining.
\p
\v 10 As a sign of God's kindness, we've each received different abilities from God's Spirit. And each of those abilities was given so that we would serve each other. So each of us are responsible to use those abilities well.
\v 11 So if you were given the ability to teach the Lord's Word, or to give news from God, you should think like this, “The words that I give don't come from myself, but from the Lord.” If you were given the ability to serve in another way, you should think, “I can serve only because the Lord gives that ability to me.” In doing that, God will be glorified through everything we do, for Christ Jesus gives those abilities to us. He's the one who's powerful and deserves to be praised forever! Amen.
\s Suffering for becoming a follower of Christ
\p
\v 12 Brothers and Sisters whom I love, don't be shocked when you experience a lot of suffering because of following Jesus. We'll experience sufferings which are very painful, of course, which feel like being burned with fire. This happens in order to test if we sincerely believe in Christ, and to prove if we're faithful to Him or not. So we shouldn't think that the trouble we experience is something unusual.
\v 13 But we really should be happy, for if we take part in experiencing suffering like Jesus experienced, that means we really are one with Him. In that way, we'll really be full of joy for sure, when He comes back to reveal His glory!
\v 14 So if someone insults you for following Christ, may you feel that you've been blessed by God. For that person's insults are a sign proving that the glory of God's Spirit is with you.
\v 15 But if you suffer for becoming a murderer, a thief, a criminal, or even because you meddle in other people's affairs, you should be ashamed.
\v 16 But if you suffer because you're a Christian, don't be ashamed. Instead, you should praise God because others call you a follower of Christ.
\v 17 For the last day has come in which God has begun to judge the world. And we— who are His own people, are the ones now being judged first. This happens because through suffering, we're made perfect. In that way, the people who don't want to believe in the Good News about Christ will be punished much more harshly than the suffering we're experiencing now.
\v 18 As it's written in God's Word,
\q1 “It isn't easy for a good person to be saved.
\q2 So sinners and those who oppose God
\q2 will be thrown into the fire of hell for sure.”\x + Prov. 11:31\x*
\m
\v 19 For that reason, if God desires for us to suffer, we should keep doing what's good and surrender ourselves to God with this thought, “Our Creator is always faithful to do everything just like He promised us.”
