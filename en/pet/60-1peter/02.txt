\s Jesus is the most important foundation stone for us
\p
\v 1 For that reason, release yourself from every kind of evil. Don't lie, don't pretend that you're better than other people, don't envy, and don't speak about the wrongs of other people.
\v 2-3 Just like a newborn baby is always thirsty for pure milk from its mother, so you should also always be thirsty for true spiritual teaching— which is that found in God's Word. For in God's Word it says, “You yourselves have tasted the kindness of the Lord.”\x + Ps 34:8\x* In that way, you'll keep maturing spiritually until the day God saves us from this world.
\p
\v 4 For we are now getting closer to the Lord Jesus. Even though man considered Him useless, God highly valued Him, and chose Him to become like the most important foundation stone in God's Temple. For us, He has become a living foundation stone.
\v 5 And each of us are also like pillars and other beams that God uses to build His Temple, until we become a dwelling place for God's Spirit Himself. And in His Temple, we become priests who serve God. Our task as priests is to bring spiritual offerings to Him, which God accepts because we've become one with Christ Jesus.
\v 6 This agrees with what's written in the Lord's Word,
\q1 “See, I chose a stone which I highly value,
\q2 which I placed as the foundation stone in My Temple in Jerusalem.\f + \fr 2:6 \fk Jerusalem \ft Peter used another name for Jerusalem— namely Zion.\f*
\q1 Everyone who believes in Him won't be disappointed.”\x + Is. 28:16\x*
\m
\v 7 So for us who believe in Jesus, He's extremely valuable. But for everyone who doesn't believe, it happens to them like this verse in the Lord's Word:
\q1 “The stone which was considered useless by the builders
\q2 God made into the most important foundation stone.”\x + Ps. 118:22\x*
\m
\v 8 And there's another verse that says,
\q1 “That stone will cause many people to fall,
\q2 like when someone's foot stubs something so that he falls.”\x + Is. 8:14-15\x*
\m They fall because they don't want to believe and follow God's Word. That's what God determined for them.
\p
\v 9 But we were chosen by God to become a special people for Him, a holy people group, and priests who serve Him who's the High King. God has done all of that for us so that we tell the amazing things which He has done— especially when He called us out of darkness to enter into His amazing light.
\v 10 So we're the ones intended in the verse of God's Word where it's written,
\q1 “You weren't God's possessions before now,
\q2 but now you've become His own special possessions.
\q1 God didn't take pity on you before now,
\q2 but now you've become people whom He loves.”\x + Hos. 2:23\x*
\s Live as citizens of God's kingdom
\p
\v 11 Brothers and Sisters whom I love, we're like foreigners and nomadic people in this world. For that reason, I beg each of you not to follow your evil bodily desires. Those desires fight against the desires of our souls.
\v 12 For now we're living among people who don't yet know God, and they accuse us of being evil people. So we need to show our good behavior to them, and eventually they may become aware and repent. In that way, they'll praise God when they see Him on the last day.
\p
\v 13 In order that the good name of our Lord Christ Jesus isn't smeared, we should submit to all of the government authorities in this world, both to the head of the nation as the highest authority
\v 14 and also to his representatives to whom he gives the duty to punish people who do evil, and to honor people who do good.
\v 15 For the will of God for us is that through our good deeds we'll shut the mouths of people who aren't wise, who like to spread slander.
\v 16 Remember that before we were set free by Jesus, we lived like the devil's slaves. Let's not think: “I'm free now, and included in those who are chosen by God, so it doesn't matter if I commit sin.” Instead, we have to consider ourselves to be servants belonging to God.
\v 17 So we have to respect everyone, love our brothers and sisters in the faith, live with feelings of fear and respect for God, and respect the head of our nation in this world.
\s Christ's suffering is an example for us to follow
\p
\v 18 Each of you who've been sold to rich people and work as their slaves should obey their desires with complete respect— not only when they're good, but also when they're mean.
\v 19 If you don't do wrong, and then are beaten by your master, you should just be quiet and remember that the Lord sees the situation too. In that way, the Lord will bless you.
\v 20 But if you've done wrong and are punished, don't hope that the Lord will bless you— even if you remain quiet. You're the one who was wrong— you know?! But if you're made to suffer even though you're serving well, and you endure it patiently, God will bless you.
\v 21 It was for that purpose that God called you! For Christ Himself has suffered for us. And He became the example for us, so that we can endure in suffering like He did.
\q1
\v 22 “He never ever committed sin,
\q2 and no one ever heard Him lie.”\x + Is. 53:9\x*
\m
\v 23 When Christ was insulted, He didn't answer back with insults. When He suffered, He didn't say, “Look out, I will pay you back too.” But He just submitted Himself to God, because He knew that God is a just judge.
\v 24 Jesus took our sins in His own body on the cross, so that spiritually we die to the power of sin, and live again to become new people who live right before God. So through Jesus wounds, we've been healed.
\v 25 We used to live like sheep that had gone astray. But now we've returned to the Shepherd who takes care of our lives!
