\s Regarding living as husband and wife
\p
\v 1 In the same way, each of you wives should obey the will of your husband. In doing that, if your husband doesn't yet believe in the teaching of Christ, by just seeing the way you live, he may become a believer. You don't need to say anything to him,
\v 2 because every day you testify to him through your pure deeds that are based on respect for God.
\v 3 Don't let your beauty be just outward beauty, such as hair arrangements, wearing gold jewelry or beautiful clothes.
\v 4 But let your beauty be something that's invisible too— which is beauty that comes from within your heart. That means a heart which is gentle and calm. Even when you're old, that beauty won't fade away and is very valuable in God's eyes.
\v 5 That was the way holy women in ancient times made themselves beautiful: They relied on God, and followed the will of their own husband.
\v 6 For example, Sarah followed the will of Abraham and called him “Master.” Each of you will also be daughters of Sarah, if you keep doing good and don't fear any kind of threat from your husband or other people.
\p
\v 7 In the same way, each of you husbands should live well with your wife, and be aware that women are physically weaker than men. You also have to respect your wife, remembering that she will enter eternal life too— through the kindness of God. If you don't respect your wife, then your prayers won't be heard, and won't be answered by God.
\s Suffering for doing right
\p
\v 8 So in conclusion, you should live with one purpose, be humble, love each other, have compassion on each other, and be kind to each other as brothers and sisters in the faith.
\v 9 When someone else does evil to you, don't repay it with evil. When someone insults you, don't repay it by insulting him. But pray that God will bless him. It's for this very reason that we've been called to become God's special possessions: So that when you're made to suffer, you repay with blessing. In that way, you'll be blessed by God in days to come too.
\v 10 For it's written in God's Word,
\b
\q1 “If you want to enjoy this life
\q2 and experience many days full of blessings,
\q1 you have to guard your tongue so that you don't lie,
\q2 and so that you don't speak evil about others.
\q1
\v 11 You must also stop doing evil things,
\q2 and try to do what's good.
\q1 You should seek the straight path,
\q2 so that you may live in peace with other people.
\q1
\v 12 For the Lord's eyes are always focused on the people who live right,
\q2 and the Lord's ears are always open to hear their prayers,
\q1 but closed to the prayers of people who do evil.”\x + Ps. 34:12-16\x*
\p
\v 13 If you're always zealous to do good like that, no one will trouble you.
\v 14 But if you still suffer because of doing things that are right, remember that the Lord will certainly bless you. And remember this Word of the Lord's: “Don't be afraid of those who threaten you. Don't be worried.”\x + Is. 8:12\x*
\v 15 In situations like that, lift up Christ as the one and only Lord of your heart. And each of you should always be ready to answer people who ask, “Why do you still hope in Jesus?”
\v 16 But you should answer with gentleness and respect. And watch out so that your heart stays clean. In that way, people who tell untrue stories about you will be ashamed of themselves when they see proof that your behavior is good, because you serve Christ.
\p
\v 17 For that reason, remember: We don't need to be ashamed of suffering just for doing good— if that happens according to God's will. But if we suffer because of doing evil things, we should be ashamed.
\p
\v 18 For Christ is our example. He Himself suffered when He died for our sins. He who wasn't guilty, took the place of us who are guilty. He did that to make us at peace with God. But after He was physically killed, God's Spirit brought Him back to life.
\v 19 And with power from God's Spirit, He descended to the world of the dead, to tell the news from God to the spirits who had been imprisoned for a long time.
\v 20 Those were the spirits of people who didn't obey God in the time of Noah, even though God waited patiently for them to repent while Noah was building that big ship. Finally, not many— only eight people, entered the ship and were carried safely through the flood.
\v 21 That flood illustrates the water of baptism for us. Baptism isn't for cleaning dirt from our bodies. But when we're baptized, we're saved, because we promise God with a clean heart, “Now I want to follow Christ Jesus.” Then we join in being spiritually buried and made alive again with Jesus.
\v 22 But now Jesus has ascended to heaven, and He's ruling there with God.\f + \fr 3:22 \fk ruling there with God \ft Literally, “at God's right hand.”\f* And God has made all angels, authorities, and all governments obey Jesus.
