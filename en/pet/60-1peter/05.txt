\s Advice for church elders
\p
\v 1 I want to give this message to every elder among you: I became an eye witness of all the sufferings of Christ, and I was also chosen to be an elder. So I will take part, along with you, in the glory that Christ will reveal to us when He comes again. For that reason, I'm asking each of you:
\v 2 Shepherd the sheep who were entrusted to you by God gladly— not because you have to. And don't take on this responsibility in order to make a profit. But do this ministry because you sincerely want to serve God.
\v 3 Don't consider yourself to be a king over the flock of sheep which God has entrusted to you, but be an example to them.
\v 4 Then when our King— who's the Great Shepherd comes, each of us will be given a crown. And that crown will reflect the glory of Christ, and its beauty won't fade away.
\s Giving final encouragements
\p
\v 5 This is what I also want to tell all the young people: You should obey the elders. Show the attitude of humility to all of the other members, because
\q1 “God opposes those who are proud,
\q2 but He's kind to those who are humble.”\x + Prov. 3:34\x*
\m
\v 6 For that reason, whatever happens, humble yourself before Almighty God, then at the time He desires, He'll lift you up.
\v 7 Commit to God all of the problems that make you worry, because He cares for you.
\p
\v 8 Watch out! And you should keep controlling yourselves. For our enemy, the devil, is like a lion who roars loudly while walking around looking for someone he can eat.
\v 9 Oppose him by continuing to believe in Christ! For you know that our brothers and sisters in the faith, in the whole world, are standing firm while experiencing suffering like you experience.
\p
\v 10 Of course the sufferings that we experience now, are just temporary. But because God is always very kind, He has called us through Christ to take part in His glory forever. After we suffer for just a short time, He Himself will help, strengthen, heal, and give us new inspiration.
\v 11 He is the powerful One forever. Amen!
\s Final greetings
\p
\v 12 I've written this short letter to you with the help of Silas, whom I consider to be our trustworthy brother in the faith. My purpose in writing this letter is to encourage your hearts by convincing you that God shows His kindness to us through everything we experience. So you should keep standing firm in God's kindness!
\p
\v 13 The church here in the city of Babylon—\f + \fr 5:13 \fk church in the city of Babylon \ft Literally, “She (the woman) who's in Babylon.” Peter used the name of the city of Babylon in exchange for the actual name— namely Rome. That name reminds the first readers of the time the people of Israel were exiled to Babylon.\f* which like you, has been chosen by God, sends their greetings to you all. Greetings also from Mark, whom I love as my own son.
\v 14 Brothers and Sisters, as those who've been purified by God, you should give each other greetings full of love.\f + \fr 5:14 \fk greetings full of love \ft Literally, “holy kiss.”\f*
\p To each of you who are one with Christ, I pray that you'll keep living with the feeling of calm in the Lord's protection.
