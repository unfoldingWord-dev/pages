\s Paul goes to Jerusalem
\p
\v 1 We and the elders of the church of Ephesus parted from each other with heavy hearts, then we sailed smoothly and headed directly to the island of Cos. The next day, we went to the island of Rhodes. And from there we continued the trip until we reached the city of Patara.
\v 2 There we saw a ship that was going to cross over to the region of Phoenicia.\f + \fr 21:2 \fk Phoenicia \ft is the coastal region of the provinces of Syria and Galilee.\f* So we went on board the ship and left.
\v 3 While we were sailing, we saw the island of Cyprus on the left. We just passed by it and kept sailing to Syria. Finally, we arrived in the city of Tyre, because the ship was carrying cargo that had to be unloaded there.
\v 4 At that time, we met some followers of Jesus there and stayed with them for seven days. Through a prophecy from God's Spirit, they advised Paul not to go to Jerusalem.
\v 5 When the time came to leave on the ship again, all the brothers in the faith there, with their wives and children, accompanied us outside the city. Then on the beach, we all knelt down and prayed.
\v 6 After saying goodbye, we boarded the ship, and they each went to their own homes.
\p
\v 7 From Tyre, we continued sailing, and arrived at the city of Ptolemais. We looked for brothers and sisters in the faith there. When we met and greeted them, they invited us to stay with them that night.
\v 8 The next day we sailed again, and arrived at the city of Caesarea. There we went to see Philip and stayed at his house. He had the special ability to proclaim the message of salvation, and he was also one of the seven men who had been chosen in the past as church workers to serve the needs of the widows.\f + \fr 21:8 \fk Philip … \ft Stories about this Philip are found in Acts 6:5; 8:5-40.\f*
\v 9 He had four unmarried daughters who had the special ability to prophesy.
\p
\v 10 After we stayed there for several days, it happened that a man named Agabus came from the province of Judea, and he also had the special ability to prophesy.
\v 11 He approached us, took Paul's belt, and tied his own feet and hands with that belt. Then he said, “The Holy Spirit says, ‘The Jews in Jerusalem will tie up the owner of this belt like this. Then they'll turn him over into the hands of non-Jewish people.’”
\p
\v 12 When we heard that, we and the brothers and sisters in the faith who were there asked Paul not to continue his trip to Jerusalem.
\v 13 But Paul answered, “Why're you crying and breaking my heart! I'm ready not only to be tied up, but even to die there— so that the name of the Lord Jesus is glorified.”
\v 14 We couldn't change his mind, so we finally stopped trying to persuade him and said, “May the Lord's will be done.”
\p
\v 15 After several days in Caesarea, we got ready to leave for Jerusalem.
\v 16 And there were some of Jesus' followers from that city who came along with us, and who would take us to Mnason's house, the place we were going to stay while in Jerusalem. Mnason was a man from Cyprus who had long ago become Jesus' follower.\f + \fr 21:16 \fk Jesus' follower \ft The meaning is probably not that Mnason followed Jesus while Jesus was living in that land, but that he had believed in Jesus for a long time, for example since the events of Acts 2-5.\f*
\s Paul visits James
\p
\v 17 When we arrived in Jerusalem, the brothers and sisters in the faith welcomed us gladly.
\v 18 Then the next day, Paul went with us to meet James. All the other elders had already gotten together with James too.
\v 19 Paul greeted them, and gave a detailed report of all the things that God had done among non-Jewish people through his ministry.
\p
\v 20 After they heard Paul's report, they all praised God. Then they said to Paul, “Brother, you can now see for yourself that there are already many thousands of Jews who believe in Jesus, and they all hold firmly to the Law.
\v 21 But they've heard false stories about you, Brother, that you teach all the Jews who're spread out in non-Jewish regions, so that they forsake Moses Law. For example, they hear that you teach that Jews don't need to follow Jewish customs or circumcise their sons.
\v 22 So now we have to decide on something to correct this situation, because they'll hear that you've returned here, for sure.
\v 23-24 So we elders advise you to do this, Brother: There are four of the brothers in the faith who've finished the time period of their special vows\f + \fr 21:23 \fk special vows \ft Apparently these four men had each already finished carrying out the special vows to God which are called “Nazirite,” according to what's written in Num. 6:1-21. In order to complete all of the requirements to finish the time period of that vow, they had to take part in a ceremony to purify themselves. In that purification ceremony, they had to give an animal offering, and shave off their hair. For until this time, as long as they were still carrying out that special vow, their hair couldn't be shaved or cut.\f* and need to follow the purification ceremony in the courtyard of God's Temple. Support them, Brother, and take part with them in the purification ceremony yourself, and pay the cost to shave everyone's hair. In that way, when they see you, all the Jews in this region will know that the news about you isn't true, and that you still follow the Law yourself.
\v 25 Whereas regarding the brothers and sisters who have believed in Jesus among the non-Jewish people groups, we have sent a letter to them in which we prohibited these things:
\li Don't eat meat that has been offered to idols;
\li or the meat of animals that have been killed by strangling;
\li or anything that contains blood;
\li and don't commit the sin of immorality.”
\p
\v 26 So the next day, Paul went with the four men to support the ceremony of purification, and he also took part in the ceremony. Then he entered the courtyard of God's Temple to tell the priests the last date of the seven day purification process, and that each of their offerings would be given on that date.
\s Paul is arrested in God's Temple
\p
\v 27 When the seven days to purify them was almost over, some Jews from the province of Asia saw Paul in one of the courtyards of God's Temple. Then they stirred up the crowd there in order to capture him.
\v 28 They shouted, “Hey, you Jewish people, help! This is him— the one who teaches everyone everywhere to oppose the traditions of our people, the Law and this Holy Temple. In fact, he has now defiled this holy place by bringing non-Jewish people into the courtyard of God's Temple.”
\v 29 (They said this because they had seen Paul in Jerusalem with Trophimus, a man from Ephesus. They thought that Paul had brought him into the courtyard of God's Temple, although he hadn't.)
\p
\v 30 Then the whole city became upset, and the crowd ran and gathered around Paul. They captured him, and dragged him out of the courtyard of God's Temple. And at that very moment, the doors of the courtyard of God's Temple were shut by the priests on guard.
\v 31 While the crowd was trying to kill Paul, a report came to the Roman troop commander\f + \fr 21:31 \fk troop commander \ft Usually a Roman troop consisted of around six hundred soldiers. And in verse 32, what's translated as 'officer' means a soldier who leads a hundred soldiers.\f* that all the residents of Jerusalem were rioting.
\v 32 He immediately ordered his soldiers and officers to run to the place of the riot. When the Jews saw the troop commander and his soldiers coming, they stopped beating Paul.
\p
\v 33 After the commander came, he ordered his soldiers to arrest Paul and tie him up with chains to two soldiers on his right and left sides. Then he asked, “Who's this man, and what has he done wrong?”
\v 34 But there were some of the crowd who were shouting this, and there were also others who were shouting that. The commander couldn't determine what was true because the voices of the people were so loud, so he commanded that Paul be brought to their barracks.
\v 35 When they reached the stone steps, the soldiers were forced to carry Paul because the crowd was agitating in very violently that he be killed,
\v 36 and because too many people were following while shouting, “Destroy him!”
\p
\v 37 When the soldiers were ready to take Paul into the barracks, Paul asked the commander, “May I have a minute to speak to you, Sir?”
\p The commander answered, “Wow, apparently you can speak the Greek language!
\v 38 If so, then you aren't the Egyptian who began a revolt some time ago, and led four thousand rebels into the desert.”
\p
\v 39 Then Paul answered, “I'm a Jew, of course, but I'm from the city of Tarsus in the province of Cilicia. So I'm a citizen of an important city in the Roman kingdom. I ask for permission to speak to this crowd.”
\p
\v 40 Then the commander gave Paul permission to speak to the crowd. Paul stood on the steps and signaled with his hand for the crowd to be quiet. When they were quiet, he began to speak in the Hebrew language:
