\c 6
\s Seven people are chosen as church workers
\p
\v 1 At that time, the number of Jesus' followers was increasing more and more. Then the Jewish brothers and sisters who spoke Greek complained against the Jewish brothers and sisters who spoke Hebrew.\f + \fr 6:1 \fk Hebrew \ft Literally “Aramaic,” which was the daily language that came from the ancient Hebrew language.\f* They complained that the widows among them were overlooked in the daily distribution of food.
\v 2 Because of that, the twelve apostles gathered all of Christ's followers and said, “It isn't good for us to leave the ministry of God's Word in order to take care of food.
\v 3 So brothers and sisters, choose seven of your men who are known as good men, that are wise and full of the Holy Spirit. Then we'll turn this ministry over to them to be their responsibility.
\v 4 In that way, we ourselves will be diligent in prayer and in teaching God's Word.”
\p
\v 5 Everyone present was happy with that suggestion. Then Christ's followers chose Stephen (a man who had great faith in Jesus, and was filled with the Holy Spirit), also Philip,\f + \fr 6:5 \fk Philip \ft Not the apostle Philip. See Acts 8:4-40.\f* Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolaus (a man from Antioch, who had just become a convert to Judaism before he became Jesus' follower).
\v 6 When those seven men were presented to the apostles, the apostles prayed, while laying their hands on them as a sign that they were set apart and sent to do that task.
\p
\v 7 After that, all of Jesus' followers kept proclaiming God's Word to people so that God's Word kept spreading, and the number of followers in Jerusalem increased more and more. In fact, a large number of Jewish priests surrendered themselves and became believers in Jesus.
\s The Jews oppose Stephen
\p
\v 8 Because of God's kindness, Stephen was given great power to perform all kinds of miracles among the crowd.
\v 9 But several people began to debate with him. They were members of a Jewish synagogue which was called the Synagogue of Free People.\f + \fr 6:9 \fk Free People \ft Those Jews were people who had been sold to masters to work as slaves in the past, or their parents were slaves. But at this time, they had already become free from slavery.\f* The members of that synagogue were residents of Jerusalem who came from the city of Cyrene, the city of Alexandria, the province of Cilicia, and the province of Asia.
\v 10 But not one of them was able to win those debates, because Stephen spoke full of wisdom by the help of the Holy Spirit.
\p
\v 11 They finally bribed several people to lie saying, “We heard Stephen insult Moses and God.”
\v 12 In that way, they stirred up the crowd and the Jewish leaders, along with the Law experts. Then they all arrested Stephen and brought him before the Religious Court council.
\p
\v 13 Then false witnesses came forward and said, “He always insults God's Temple and the Law.
\v 14 For we've heard him say that Jesus of Nazareth will destroy God's Temple and change the customs which Moses gave us.”
\v 15 When everyone sitting in the council looked at Stephen, they saw his face radiating goodness like the face of an angel.
