\s The Jewish leaders accuse Paul before Governor Felix
\p
\v 1 After five days had passed, the high priest Ananias and some leaders of the Jews went to Caesarea. They went to the governor to present their accusations against Paul. An expert in national law, whose name was Tertullus, went with them.
\v 2-3 Then Paul was called and brought before the governor. After that, Tertullus began to accuse Paul by saying, “Governor Felix, whom I honor, because of your government Sir, we've enjoyed a state of peace. And our people have also experienced many improvements because of your wisdom. So in all of these things, and wherever we are, we really appreciate everything you've done, and we're thankful for all of that.
\v 4 However, so that I don't waste too much of your time, Sir, I respectfully ask that you be willing to hear this brief accusation of ours.
\v 5 We've found that this man is a trouble maker. He causes many divisions among the Jews in the whole world. He's also a leader of the group that follows the teaching of that Nazarene.
\v 6-8 He also tried to defile God's Temple,, but we quickly caught him.\f + \fr 24:6-8 \fk Verses 6-8 \ft Some ancient manuscripts add these words: At that time, we wanted to punish him according to our own religious law. But Lysias, the commander of the troops came and snatched him from our hands, using force. Then he ordered us to come to you, Sir, and present our accusations about the wrong doings of this man.\f* If you examine him, Sir, you'll find out for yourself that all of our accusations against him are true.”
\v 9 And the Jews who were there joined in supporting and affirming that all those accusations were definitely true.
\s Paul defends himself before Governor Felix
\p
\v 10 When the governor gave a sign as permission for Paul to speak, Paul said, “Your honor, Mr. Governor: I know that for years you've been a leader of this people group, and have decided its legal cases. For that reason, I'm not afraid to defend myself before you, Sir.
\v 11 It's quite easy to prove that not more than twelve days ago, I came to Jerusalem to worship at God's Temple. So there wasn't time for me to do what they accuse me of.
\v 12 And no one ever saw me quarrel or create a disturbance— either in the courtyards of God's Temple, or in the Jewish synagogues, or anywhere at all in that city.
\v 13 And these men can't prove to you that their accusations are true, Sir.
\p
\v 14 But I admit that I worship the God of our forefathers by following ‘the way of salvation’, which was taught by Jesus, the Nazarene. According to these people, anyone who follows that way is a follower of false teaching. But I still believe in everything that's written in the Law and in the books of the prophets.
\v 15 Just like them, I also have confidence that some day in the future, God will raise up everyone from death— whether it be those who were righteous or those who were evil.
\v 16 And because of that, I always try to do what's best, so that my conscience doesn't feel guilty, and in that way I live right in the sight of God and man.
\p
\v 17 “After being away from Jerusalem for several years, I returned there to bring some sacrificial offerings to God, and also contributions to help fellow brothers and sisters who're poor.
\v 18-19 When some Jews from Asia met me in the courtyard of God's Temple, I had just completed the ceremony of purifying myself,\f + \fr 24:18 \fk ceremony of purifying myself \ft See the note in Acts 21:23.\f* and at that time, there wasn't a crowd there and I wasn't involved in any disturbance. Those people from Asia are the ones who should come to you and tell you their accusations, Sir, if they have accusations against me.
\v 20-21 Or let these men who are here say what wrong they found when I stood up to be examined before the Religious Court. At that time, they didn't find any wrong with me at all, except they weren't happy with the statement which I gave with a loud voice. I said, ‘Today I'm being tried because of my belief— which is that dead people will be brought back to life!’”
\p
\v 22 When he heard that, Governor Felix postponed the council, saying, “When commander Lysias comes, I'll decide your case.” (It happened that Felix already knew a lot about the way that was taught by Jesus.)
\v 23 Then he ordered his officer to keep Paul under guard, but not to be bound with a chain, and not to prevent Paul's friends from helping him when he needed something.
\s Paul speaks to Felix and his wife
\p
\v 24 Several days later, Felix and his wife returned to the city after a visit. (His wife Drusilla was a Jewish woman.) So Felix ordered Paul to face the two of them. Then they listened to Paul speak about how to believe in Christ Jesus.
\v 25 But when Paul explained how to live right in the Lord's eyes, about controlling one's self, and how God will later judge mankind, Felix became afraid, and said, “That's enough! You may go now. If there's an opportunity, I'll call you again.”
\v 26 During this time, Felix hoped that Paul would give him bribe money. That's why he often ordered Paul to be brought before him to talk with him.
\p
\v 27 But after two years had passed, Felix was replaced by Porcius Festus. When Felix left his position, he deliberately left Paul in jail because he wanted to please the Jews.
