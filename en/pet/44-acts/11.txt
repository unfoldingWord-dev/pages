\c 11
\s Peter returns to Jerusalem
\p
\v 1 Then all the apostles and brothers and sisters in the faith in the province of Judea heard that non-Jewish people had also believed the Word of God about the Lord Jesus.
\v 2 So when Peter went to Jerusalem, there were Jewish brothers and sisters in the faith\f + \fr 11:2 \fk Jewish brothers and sisters \ft Literally, “people from the (group of the) circumcised.“\f* who argued with him.
\v 3 They said, “You went to the house of non-Jewish people\f + \fr 11:3 \fk not Jews \ft Literally, “those who aren't circumcised.”\f* and you even ate with them!”
\p
\v 4 So Peter explained everything that had happened from the beginning.
\v 5 Peter said, “When I was in the city of Joppa and was praying, I had a vision, and I saw something that looked like a wide linen sheet which descended from the sky. The sheet was hanging by its four corners. Then the sheet came down right in front of me.
\v 6 When I noticed what was inside the sheet, I saw that there were many kinds of animals that can't be eaten by Jews, including four-legged animals, animals that crawl on the ground, and wild birds.
\v 7 Then I heard a voice which said to me, ‘Stand up, Peter! Kill something and eat it.’
\v 8 But I said, ‘No Lord! I've never eaten anything that's forbidden or unclean.’
\v 9 Then the voice spoke from the sky again, ‘What God says is permitted you must not consider forbidden.’
\v 10 That vision happened three times, then the sheet was immediately taken up again into the sky.
\v 11 And at that very moment, there were three men who came to the house where I was staying. They were from Caesarea having been sent to call me.
\v 12 Then the Holy Spirit told me to go with them without doubting. The six brothers from Joppa who're sitting here now also went with me, when we went into the house of that non-Jewish man.
\v 13 And the owner of that house told us how he had seen an angel standing in his house and saying, ‘Send some people to Joppa to get Simon— who is also called Peter.
\v 14 He'll tell you the news about how you and everyone who lives with you can be saved.’
\v 15 Then when I began to speak, the Holy Spirit suddenly descended on them, just like what we experienced earlier.
\v 16 Then I remembered that the Lord Jesus had said, ‘John baptized you with water in the past, but you'll be baptized with the Holy Spirit.’
\v 17 So if God had given His Spirit to those who aren't Jews, how could I possibly hinder the Lord! They've also received the same gift that we received earlier, based on believing in our Lord Christ Jesus.”
\p
\v 18 When the Jewish brothers and sisters had listended to Peter's explanation, they stopped opposing him and praised God, “Wow! If that's so, God has also given the opportunity to non-Jewish people to repent and receive eternal life, just like us!”
\s The Good News arrives in the city of Antioch
\p
\v 19 Meanwhile, the believers who had scattered because of the persecution which happened after Stephen's murder fled as far as the country of Phoenicia, the island of Cyprus, and the city of Antioch. They still kept on telling God's Word about Jesus in those places, but only to the Jews.
\v 20 But there were some of them who came from Cyprus and the city of Cyrene. When they went to Antioch, they began to tell the Good News about the Lord Jesus to people who weren't Jews.
\v 21 And the Lord God helped them, so a large number of non-Jewish people believed and converted to become worshipers of the Lord Jesus.
\p
\v 22 When the church in Jerusalem heard about those people who had recently believed, they sent Barnabas to Antioch.
\v 23-24 Barnabas was a very good person— being full of the Holy Spirit and having strong faith. When he arrived and saw that the Lord was obviously showing His kindness there, he was really happy. Then he urged all the believers there to wholeheartedly remain faithful to the Lord. In the end, many more people became the Lord's followers because of Barnabas' ministry.
\p
\v 25 Then Barnabas went to the city of Tarsus to look for Saul.
\v 26 After he found Saul, Barnabas brought him back to Antioch. Then they were involved in the church and taught a large number of people for a whole year. And it was at Antioch that Jesus' followers were first called “Christians.”
\p
\v 27 At that time, some people from Jerusalem who had the special ability to prophesy came to Antioch.
\v 28 One of them was named Agabus. He stood up in the church meeting, and by the Holy Spirit's power he said, “Almost all of the world's population will experience a great famine.” (That famine happened while Claudius was ruling as high king in Rome.)
\v 29 After hearing that prophecy, all of Jesus' followers in Antioch decided to collect a contribution and send it to help the brothers and sisters in the faith in the province of Judea. They agreed to give as large a contribution as possible— according to each one's ability.
\v 30 They did that, and then sent Barnabas and Saul to turn over the funds to the elders of the believers in Jerusalem.
