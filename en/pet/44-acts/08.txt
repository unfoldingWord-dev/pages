\c 8
\p
\v 1-3 Saul also agreed that killing Stephen was a good thing. After that, some devout men buried Stephen, and they cried for him very sadly.
\s Saul persecutes the believers
\p But on that day a great persecution also began against the believers in Jerusalem. And Saul was trying to destroy the church. He went from house to house and dragged believers to imprison them— both men and women. So many, many believers fled from Jerusalem and scattered to various places in Judea and Samaria, but the twelve apostles still remained in Jerusalem.
\v 4 The believers who were scattered continually told the Good News wherever they went.
\s Philip tells the Good News in Samaria
\p
\v 5 Philip\f + \fr 8:5 \fk Philip \ft Not the apostle named Philip. See Acts 6:5.\f* went to the city of Samaria and told the people there about the Christ.
\v 6 When they heard his teaching and witnessed the many miracles he did, they all listened very attentively.
\v 7 Many residents of that city were possessed by evil spirits, but Philip drove out the spirits in Jesus' name. The evil spirits went out crying loudly. Many lame and totally paralyzed people were also healed.
\v 8 So the people in that city were very joyful because of all of that.
\p
\v 9 But there was also a sorcerer in Samaria who was named Simon. He had made the residents of Samaria amazed with his knowledge of sorcery for a long time. He also claimed that he was a great person.
\v 10 So before Philip came, all of the people of Samaria— both ordinary as well as important people, paid attention to him and said, “This man has God's power called the great power.”
\v 11 So they really respected Simon, because he had amazed them with his knowledge of sorcery for so long.
\p
\v 12 But when Philip told them the Good News about God's kingdom and Christ Jesus' power, many people believed the news— both men and women, then Philip baptized them.
\v 13 Simon himself believed and was baptized. After that he always followed Philip. And when he saw the many miracles that Philip did which were amazing, he was really amazed.
\p
\v 14 When the apostles, who were still in Jerusalem, heard that the people in Samaria had accepted God's Word which Philip had told them, they sent Peter and John to them.
\v 15 When they arrived, they prayed that the Samaritans who had believed would receive the Holy Spirit.
\v 16 The believers had been baptized in the Lord Jesus' name, of course, but the Holy Spirit hadn't yet descended on them.
\v 17 So when Peter and John laid their hands on them, only then did they receive the Holy Spirit.
\p
\v 18 Then when Simon saw that the Holy Spirit was given to those people through the two apostles who placed their hands on them, he offered money to the apostles.
\v 19 He said, “Give me that power too, so that when I lay my hands on anyone, that person will receive the Holy Spirit.”
\p
\v 20 But Peter answered Simon, “Perish along with your money— because you think you can buy God's special ability with money!
\v 21 You don't have the right to take part in this work, because your heart isn't right before God.
\v 22 For that reason, repent. Pray that the Lord forgives this evil desire in your heart.
\v 23 For I see that you're trapped in sin, and your heart is full of envy.”
\p
\v 24 Then Simon answered. “Please, both of you pray to the Lord for me so that all that you've said won't happen to me.”
\p
\v 25 After the two apostles gave a testimony and told them the Lord's Word, they returned to Jerusalem. And on the way back, they went through many villages in the region of Samaria and told the Good News about Jesus to many people.
\s Philip teaches an Ethiopian
\p
\v 26 One day, an angel spoke to Philip and ordered him like this, “Get ready and go to the south,\f + \fr 8:26 \fk to the south \ft In Greek, this can also be translated “about mid-day.”\f* to the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.” (That road crosses a deserted area.)
\v 27 So Philip got ready and left. He saw an Ethiopian eunuch\f + \fr 8:27 \fk eunuch \ft A person who had been castrated when he was small. Eunuchs were often entrusted with important positions.\f* there who was an official of the queen of Ethiopia,\f + \fr 8:27 \fk queen of Ethiopia \ft Literally, “candace/queen of Ethiopia.” The word 'candace' wasn't her name, but the word 'queen' in the Ethiopian language.\f* who was responsible for all the treasury of that land. He had gone to worship in Jerusalem,
\v 28 and at that time, he was on his way home. His servant was driving his carriage, while the official himself sat and read from the book of the Prophet Isaiah.
\v 29 Then the Holy Spirit said to Philip, “Go and get close to the carriage.”
\v 30 So Philip ran close to the carriage and heard the official reading from the book of the Prophet Isaiah. Then Philip said to him. “Sir, do you understand what you're reading?”
\p
\v 31 The official said, “I can't possibly understand it if there isn't anyone to explain it to me.” Then the official asked Philip to come up into his carriage and sit with him.
\v 32 The part of the Holy Bible that he was reading was as follows,
\q1 “He was just like a lamb that was brought to be sacrificed,
\q2 and like a lamb that doesn't make a sound when someone cuts its wool.
\q2 In the same way, that Man didn't say a single word.
\q1
\v 33 He was humiliated and all of His rights were taken away.
\q2 No one can talk about His descendants,\f + \fr 8:33 \fk keturunan-Nya \ft Most commentators say that the Greek word ‘genean’ here means ‘descendants’. There are some who interpret the word as His/Jesus' ‘generation’. According to that interpretation this phrase can be translated, “It is hard to explain how evil the people of His age were.” There is very little commentator support for understanding ‘genean’ as His ‘origins’.\f*
\q2 because He was killed and taken from this world before He had any children.”\x + Is. 53:7-8\x*
\p
\v 34 The official said to Philip, “Please tell me: Who's the Prophet talking about? Was he talking about himself or someone else?”
\v 35 Then Philip began to explain it to him. He told the Good News about Jesus to him, beginning with that passage.
\p
\v 36-37 On the way, they arrived at a place where there was water. And the official said to Philip, “Look, here's water. Why can't I be baptized now?”\f + \fr 8:36-37 \fk Verse 37 \ft In several ancient manuscripts in the Greek language, there are words that were afterwards counted as verse 37. But almost all of the commentators say that these words weren't written by Luke: Philip answered, “If you believe with your whole heart, you can be baptized.” The official said, “I believe that Christ Jesus is God's Son.”\f*
\p
\v 38 Then the official commanded the carriage to stop, so the two of them got out and went into the water. Then Philip baptized him.
\v 39 After they came out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord suddenly took Philip away from that place, and the official didn't see him any more. Then the official continued on his trip with a cheerful heart.
\v 40 But Philip suddenly appeared in a city called Azotus. Then he traveled through that region while telling the Good News in every city that he passed through, until he reached the city of Caesarea.
