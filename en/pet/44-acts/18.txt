\c 18
\s Paul in Corinth
\p
\v 1 After that, Paul left the city of Athens and went to Corinth.
\v 2 There he met a Jew whose name was Aquila, who came from the province of Pontus. He and his wife, Priscilla, had just recently come from Italy because the high king Claudius had commanded that all the Jews had to leave Rome.
\v 3 And because Paul had the same occupation as they did— which was making tents, he lived and worked with the two of them.
\p
\v 4 Paul went to the synagogue of the Jews every Sabbath Day and talked with everyone who was present there— both Jews and non-Jews. He tried to convince them to believe in Jesus.
\v 5 But when Silas and Timothy came from Macedonia, Paul devoted himself completely to teaching the news of salvation to everyone who was of the Jewish religion. He kept giving his testimony that Jesus is the Christ\f + \fr 18:5 \fk Christ \ft See the footnote in Acts 2:36.\f* promised by God.
\v 6 But when they opposed and insulted Paul, he shook the dust off his robe— as a sign that they had to bear God's punishment, and said to them, “You yourselves will bear God's punishment— not me! So from now on, I'll go teach the news of salvation to non-Jewish people groups.”
\p
\v 7 So Paul left the synagogue and entered Titius' house— which was next door to the synagogue. Titius— who was also called Justus, was a non-Jew who had become a worshiper of God before this.
\v 8 Crispus, the head of the synagogue, along with his whole family, also believed in the Lord Jesus. And many other people in Corinth who heard Paul's teaching believed, and all those believers were baptized.
\p
\v 9 One night the Lord said to Paul in a vision, “Don't be afraid. Keep teaching boldly and don't keep silent,
\v 10 because I'm with you! No one will trouble you. Keep teaching, because I've chosen many people in this city to become My people.”
\v 11 Then Paul stayed and kept on teaching the news of salvation there for a year and a half.
\s Paul is brought before Gallio
\p
\v 12 But while Gallio was in the position of governor of the province of Achaia, the leaders of the Jews united to oppose Paul. They captured him and brought him to be tried before Gallio.
\v 13 They accused him by saying, “This person teaches people to worship God in a way which opposes our Law.”
\p
\v 14 When Paul wanted to speak, Gallio answered them, “If you Jews reported him because of doing something wrong or some crime, I could be patient and listen to your complaint.
\v 15 But your complaint is merely a question of words and names that are only found in your Jewish law. You can deal with things like that yourselves. I refuse to be a judge of such things.”
\v 16 Then Gallio ordered them to be driven out of the courtroom.
\v 17 While the Jews were being driven out, some of the officers of the peace who were doing that caught Sosthenes— who was the leader of the Jewish synagogue, then beat him. Even though he was beaten right there in the courtroom, Gallio didn't care.
\s Paul returns to Antioch in the province of Syria
\p
\v 18 After that, Paul stayed in Corinth a few more months. Then he said goodbye to the brothers and sisters in the faith, and sailed to the province of Syria with Priscilla and Aquila. While in the harbor city of Cenchrea, Paul shaved his hair before leaving, according to a Jewish custom, as a sign that he had kept a vow to the Lord.
\v 19-21 When they arrived in Ephesus, Paul entered the Jewish synagogue and had a discussion with the Jews who were present there. They asked him to stay there longer, but he refused saying, “If God permits, I' ll come here again.” After that, he boarded a ship and left Priscilla and Aquila there.
\p
\v 22 When Paul arrived in Caesarea, he went to Jerusalem to give greetings to the church there. Then he continued his journey to Antioch.
\v 23 After staying there for some time, he went to visit the churches in the provinces of Galatia and Phrygia— resulting that the faith of all Jesus' followers was strengthened.
\s Apollos in Ephesus and the province of Achaia
\p
\v 24 At the same time, a Jew named Apollos came to Ephesus. He came from the city of Alexandria, Egypt, and he was a person who had studied much about the Holy Bible and was a great speaker.
\v 25 He taught with fiery enthusiasm about the way of salvation which would come through Jesus in the Jewish synagogue. He taught accurately about Jesus, but he only knew the story of Jesus up to the baptism of John.
\v 26 Priscilla and Aquila were present when Apollos began to teach boldly in the synagogue, so they took him to their house and explained the way of salvation to him more completely.
\p
\v 27 After that, Apollos wanted to go to the province of Achaia. Then the brothers and sisters in the faith in Ephesus helped him by writing a letter of introduction, so that all of the brothers and sisters in the faith there would receive him well. When he arrived there, he really helped all those who because of the Lord's kindness had already believed in Jesus.
\v 28 For he overwhelmingly defeated the Jews in public debates who didn't believe in Jesus. He proved that Jesus is the Christ who was promised from verses in the Holy Bible.
