\s Peter and John defend themselves before the Religious Court
\p
\v 1 While Peter and John were talking to the crowd, some Jewish leaders began to oppose them. The leaders who were present there were the chief guards of the Temple, some priests, and some of the Sadducee group.\f + \fr 4:1 \fk Sadducee group \ft Most of the members of the Sadducee group were leaders of the Jewish religion, and most of them were priests. They only believed in the first five books of the Old Testament, written by Moses: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. They believed that that those who've died won't live again. See Acts 23:8.\f*
\v 2 They were very angry at Peter and John because the two apostles were speaking to the crowd, and teaching that believers will live again after death, through the power of Jesus.
\v 3 So the leaders arrested the two apostles and put them in jail. Because it was already evening, the two of them were kept there until the next day.
\v 4 However, many people who had heard Peter and John's teaching became believers in Jesus because of what they said. In that way, the number of believers became about five thousand people, not including women and children.
\p
\v 5 The following day, the Jewish authorities and leaders held a council in Jerusalem, along with the Law experts.
\v 6 The high priest, Annas, was present, with all the important people in his family, including Caiaphas, John,\f + \fr 4:6 \fk John \ft This isn't the apostle John. He might have been Jonathan, who later replaced Caiaphas as the high priest.\f* and Alexander.
\v 7 After they ordered the two apostles to stand before them, the council presented this question to them, “By what power, or in whose name did you make that paralyzed man well?”
\p
\v 8 Then Peter, who at that time was full of the Holy Spirit, said to them, “Sirs, authorities and leaders of the nation:
\v 9 If we're being tried today because we did a good deed to a paralyzed man, and are asked how he was healed,
\v 10 then you and all the Jews should know that this man was made well in the name and power of Christ Jesus the Nazarene, whom you crucified. But He was brought back to life from death by God. So through the power of this Jesus, this paralyzed man can stand healthy before you now.
\v 11 As God's Word says, Jesus is pictured as
\q1 ‘The foundation stone that was considered to be useless by the builders’— that is you yourselves,
\q2 ‘but God has made that Stone become the most important Stone.’\x + Ps. 118:22\x*
\m
\v 12 So He's the only One who can save mankind. For in all the world, He alone was chosen by God as the Savior of mankind. There's no other one.”
\p
\v 13 At that moment, the leaders realized that Peter and John were ordinary people who didn't have any special education, but they were also amazed because those two men spoke with boldness. And they also realized that Peter and John had often been with Jesus.
\v 14 And because the man who had been healed was standing there with Peter and John, they couldn't say anything to oppose the two apostles.
\v 15 So they ordered the two apostles to leave the council room of the Religious Court, and they discussed it together and said,
\v 16 “What will we do to these two men? For everyone in Jerusalem has heard that this exceptional miracle came about through the two of them, and we can't deny it.
\v 17 But we need to threaten them so that this news doesn't spread more widely among more people, and forbid the two of them to speak anymore to anyone using the name of that Nazarene.”
\p
\v 18 So they ordered Peter and John to come back in. Then they forbid the two apostles to teach or speak to anyone about Jesus.
\v 19 But Peter and John answered, “You yourselves should think about what's right: To obey God or to obey you!
\v 20 For we can't keep quiet about what we've seen and heard.”
\v 21-22 In the end, the Jewish leaders couldn't find a reason to punish the two apostles because everyone was praising God for what had happened, since the person who had experienced the miraculous healing was already over forty years old. For that reason, the leaders released the two apostles, but with even more severe threats.
\s Peter and John return to the group of believers
\p
\v 23 After being released, Peter and John returned to the group of believers. Then the two of them told everything that the chief priests and Jewish leaders in that council had said.
\v 24 When the believers heard that, they all prayed with one heart to God, “O Lord Almighty, You're the one who created the sky, the earth, the sea, and all they contain.
\v 25 By Your Holy Spirit, You've spoken through Your servant, our forefather David, saying,
\q1 ‘It's useless for non-Jewish peoples to be angry and act to oppose God.
\q2 And it's useless for the people who don't know God to plan to oppose Him.
\q1
\v 26 Their kings and all the world's authorities combine their armies
\q2 to war against God,
\q2 and the Christ whom He promised.’\x + Ps. 2:1-2\x*
\m
\v 27 Yes, Lord, that very truly happened here in Jerusalem!— when King Herod, Governor Pontius Pilate, and the non-Jewish people, along with the Jews, united to oppose Jesus— who is Your holy Servant whom You anointed to be the Christ.
\v 28 But because You're the Almighty, all of that happened according to Your will and Your plan from the past.
\v 29 So now, O Lord, take note of their threats against us, and help us, Your servants, to tell the News of Salvation from You with complete boldness.
\v 30 And we ask You to stretch out Your powerful hand to heal sick people, and do all kinds of miracles. And may all of that happen only to glorify Jesus' name.”
\p
\v 31 Then after they had prayed, the place where they were meeting was shaken. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they kept telling God's Word with complete boldness.
\s The believers share their possessions with each other
\p
\v 32 The whole group of believers was united in heart and soul. No one said that his possessions were just his own property. Everything they owned was used for the common good.
\v 33 And the apostles gave their testimony with great power, that the Lord Jesus had been brought back to life from death. And God just kept showing that He was very kind to all of the believers.
\v 34 At that time, none of them was needy. For it often happened that one of them who owned a field or a house, sold his property, and the proceeds of the sale were brought
\v 35 and turned over to the apostles. Then the money was distributed to those who needed it.
\p
\v 36 One of them who was named Joseph, who came from the island of Cyprus and was from the family of the tribe of Levi, did that. The apostles gave him a new name— which was Barnabas. The name means “one who encourages others.”
\v 37 Barnabas sold a field he owned, then brought the money from the sale of that field and turned it over to the apostles.
