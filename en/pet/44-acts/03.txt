\s Peter heals a paralyzed man
\p
\v 1 One day, Peter and John went to the courtyard of God's Temple to take part in the prayer time— which was about three o'clock in the afternoon.
\v 2 At the door to the courtyard of God's Temple, which was named the Beautiful Gate, there was a beggar whose legs were paralyzed since birth. His friends placed him at the gate of the courtyard everyday, so that he could beg money from people who were going in and out of the courtyard.
\v 3 When the beggar saw Peter and John entering, he asked them for money.
\v 4 Then the two of them looked at the paralyzed man and said, “Look at us.”
\v 5 So he looked at them, hoping to receive money from them.
\v 6 But Peter said, “I don't have any gold or silver, but I will give you what I have: By the power of Christ Jesus— that is He who came from Nazareth, I command you to stand up and walk!”
\v 7 Then Peter held his right hand and helped him to stand up. His feet and ankles became strong immediately.
\v 8 He stood up quickly and began to walk! Then he followed them into the courtyard of God's Temple while walking and jumping around, along with praising God.
\v 9-10 And all the people there recognized him as the beggar who always sat at the gate of the courtyard— which is the Beautiful Gate. When they saw him walking, and heard him praising God, they were really amazed and confused because of what had happened to him.
\s Peter speaks to the crowd
\p
\v 11 The man kept on following Peter and John, holding on to them continually. Then all of the amazed people ran to them in the courtyard which is called Solomon's Porch.\f + \fr 3:11 \fk Solomon's Porch \ft was a section on the eastern-most side of God's Temple complex. Solomon's Porch had many pillars made from stone to hold up the roof.\f*
\v 12 When Peter saw the crowd, he said to them, “Jewish brothers and sisters, why're you amazed at what happened? Why do you keep looking at us— as if we have unusual power or special goodness in God's eyes to make this man well and able to walk?
\v 13 It wasn't us, but God who healed him. The God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob— namely the God of our forefathers, has done this to glorify His Servant Jesus. He's the Man whom you handed over to be killed. You rejected Him before Governor Pilate, even though Pilate had already decided to release Him.
\v 14 You didn't want to acknowledge Him who's holy and righteous, but you asked Pilate that a murderer\f + \fr 3:14 \fk murderer \ft Barabbas, the that man the Jews asked Pilate to release in exchange for Jesus. (Luke 23:18)\f* be released to you.
\v 15 So you actually killed Him who is the source of life, but God caused Him to live again after death. We've been sent to witness about that event.
\v 16 Jesus' power is what gave strength to this paralyzed man— whom you've seen and already know. This happened because we believe in His power. The truth is, as you've witnessed for yourselves, this person was completely healed because of our faith in Jesus.
\p
\v 17 “Brothers and sisters, I know that you and our leaders weren't aware of what you did when you killed Jesus.
\v 18 But in that way, God fulfilled what He spoke in the past through the words of the prophets that His Servant Christ must suffer and die.
\v 19 Because of that, repent and return to God, so that your sins are forgiven.
\v 20 Then God will give spiritual refreshment to you. And God will send Jesus to us once again— that is He whom God has chosen as the Christ.\f + \fr 3:20 \fk Christ \ft See the footnote about Christ in Acts 2:36.\f*
\v 21 But Jesus must stay in heaven until the time of the restoration of everything, like what God spoke through the prophets in the past.
\v 22 Remember what Moses said,
\mi ‘The Lord your God will give you another Prophet—\f + \fr 3:22 \fk Prophet \ft A capital letter is used for the word Prophet in this quote, because Peter meant is that this Prophet was Jesus.\f* who will be a Prophet like me, who will come from our own people. You have to obey everything that the Prophet says.
\v 23 And whoever doesn't obey that Prophet will be thrown out of God's people.’\x + Deut. 18:15-19\x*
\m
\v 24 Beginning with the prophet Samuel, all the other prophets have prophesied about this time.
\v 25 We're the heirs of those prophets, of course, and we're included in the promise given by God to our forefathers. Now it has begun to happen according to God's word to Abraham,
\mi ‘Everyone in this world will be blessed through your descendants.’\x + Gen. 22:18; 26:24\x*
\m
\v 26 So when God brought His Servant Jesus back to life again, God sent Him to us, the people of Israel, first of all, so that He would bless us if each of us repents of our wickedness.”
