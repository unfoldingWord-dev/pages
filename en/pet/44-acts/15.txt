\s Meeting in Jerusalem
\p
\v 1 At that very time, there were some people, who came to Antioch from the province of Judea, who taught the brothers and sisters following Jesus like this, “If you who aren't Jews don't follow the custom of circumcision which Moses taught, you won't be saved.”
\v 2 But Paul and Barnabas strongly disagreed with this teaching. After a serious debate arose among them, all of the brothers in the faith decided to send Paul and Barnabas, along with some other people, to go to the apostles and elders of all of the believers in Jerusalem to discuss that problem.
\p
\v 3 So with the support of the church, they went to Jerusalem. When they passed through the provinces of Phoenicia and Samaria, they also visited the brothers and sisters in the faith there and told them that many non-Jewish people had repented and followed Jesus. The brothers and sisters in the faith were very joyful when they heard that.
\v 4 When they arrived in Jerusalem, they were warmly welcomed by the apostles and elders, along with other brothers and sisters in the faith. Then Paul and Barnabas reported everything that God had done through them.
\v 5 But some brothers in the faith who had previously been members of the Pharisee religious group, stood up and said, “Those non-Jewish believers need to be circumcised, and we need to command them to obey the whole Law of Moses.”
\p
\v 6 Then the apostles and all the elders gathered to talk about this problem.
\v 7 After a long debate, Peter stood up and said, “Brothers, you know that God chose me in the past, from among you, to become the first person to tell the Good News to people who aren't Jews, so that they would believe.
\v 8 And God, who knows everyone's heart, has accepted those non-Jewish people. God showed us this when He gave the Holy Spirit to them, just as He had been given to us.
\v 9 And God didn't differentiate between us and them at all. Just like what happened to us, God purified their hearts the moment they believed.
\v 10 So why're you testing God now by making it difficult for our non-Jewish brothers and sisters in the faith? Neither we or our forefathers were ever able to keep the whole Law. Why burden them with all of that?
\v 11 Instead, we believe that we Jews can only be saved through the kindness of the Lord Jesus. And it's the same for those who aren't Jews.”
\p
\v 12 Then everyone present became quiet and listened to Barnabas and Paul, who told about all the miracles that God had done through them among those who aren't Jews.
\v 13 After the two of them finished speaking, James said, “Brothers, listen to me.
\v 14 Peter has already told us how God showed His kindness to people who aren't Jews for the first time— in which many of them were chosen to become His people.
\v 15 This happened according to what was prophesied by one of the prophets, as it's written,
\q1
\v 16 ‘After that, I'll return and rebuild the David's kingdom which has been ruined.
\q2 It's like a tent which has collapsed.
\q2 But I'll rebuild it and set that tent up again.
\q1
\v 17 I'll do this so that the rest of mankind, who still remain, will seek the Lord—
\q2 including all the non-Jewish people groups,
\q2 that is those whom I've chosen to become My people.
\q1 These are the words of the Lord, who will do this.’\f + \fr 15:17 \fk This quote \ft is from Amos 9:11-12 in the translation in the Greek language which is called LXX.\f*
\q1
\v 18 ‘He's the one who told about His plans long before they happened.’”\x + Is. 45:21\x*
\p
\v 19 Then James continued, “For that reason, in my opinion, let's not make it difficult for non-Jewish people who've begun to repent and return to God.
\v 20 But we need to write a letter to them to tell them
\li not to eat meat that has become unclean through being offered to idols;
\li or meat of animals that were killed by strangling;
\li or anything that contains blood;
\li and not to commit the sin of immorality.
\m
\v 21 These prohibitions are not new to them, because from times past until now Moses' Law has been taught every Sabbath Day in Jewish synagogues in every city.”
\s The letter to non-Jewish brothers and sisters in the faith
\p
\v 22 Then the apostles and elders, along with the whole church, decided to choose and send some of them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. So they chose Silas and Judas— who was also called Barsabbas. Those two men were respected as leaders among the brothers and sisters in the faith in Jerusalem.
\v 23 A letter was given to the two men to carry, which read like this:
\mi “Greetings to all of you non-Jewish brothers and sisters in the faith who're in the city of Antioch, and in other places in the provinces of Syria and Cilicia. This letter is from the apostles and elders of all the believers in Jerusalem— who're your brothers.
\pi
\v 24 We've heard there were some people who went to you from our region, and they taught you some things that made you doubt and waiver in your faith. But we didn't send them to teach you.
\v 25 For that reason, we all unanimously decided to choose two people and send them to you with our two beloved brothers— Barnabas and Paul.
\v 26 Barnabas and Paul have risked their lives to serve our Lord Christ Jesus.
\v 27 So we've sent Judas and Silas to tell what's written in this letter in person too.
\v 28 For the the Holy Spirit's opinion, and ours too, is not to burden you with more rules than what's necessary— that is:
\li
\v 29 Don't eat meat which has been offered to idols;
\li or meat of animals killed by strangling;
\li or anything that contains blood.
\li And don't commit the sin of immorality.
\mi If you avoid those things, you'll do well.
\mi That's all, and greetings from us.”
\p
\v 30 So the group of messengers left Jerusalem and went to Antioch. When they arrived, they gathered the church together and told them what was in the letter.
\v 31 And when the letter was read, the church was very glad because the advice in the letter encouraged them.
\v 32 Judas and Silas also had the special ability to prophesy. So they said many things to advise and encourage the brothers and sisters in the faith.
\v 33-34 Then after the two of them stayed there for some time, the church in Antioch sent them back to the church in Jerusalem. When they parted, the church prayed that God would always protect them.\f + \fr 15:34 \fk Verse 34 \ft In some ancient manuscripts in the Greek language, these words are found, which were then counted as verse 34: “But Silas decided to stay there.”\f*
\p
\v 35 But Paul and Barnabas stayed in Antioch for some time. They and many other people taught the news of salvation and the Lord's Word to the people there.
\s Paul and Barnabas separate
\p
\v 36 Then after a while, Paul said to Barnabas, “Let's go back and visit our brothers and sisters in the faith in every city where we told the Lord's Word before— to that we can know how they're doing.”
\v 37 Barnabas agreed, but he wanted Mark— who was called John, to go with them again.
\v 38 But Paul didn't feel good about taking him, because John had left them in Pamphylia and didn't continue the work of ministry with them.
\v 39 For that reason, a major disagreement arose between Paul and Barnabas, so they separated. Barnabas took Mark and went by ship to the island of Cyprus.
\v 40 But Paul chose Silas, and they left after the brothers and sisters in the faith in Antioch entrusted them to the Lord God, so that He would protect them with His kindness.
\v 41 Then Paul and Silas visited the whole province of Syria and Cilicia, while strengthening the faith of the churches there.
