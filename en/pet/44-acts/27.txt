\s Paul sails to Rome
\p
\v 1 When the date came that was set for us— including me, Luke, to sail to the province of Italy, Paul and some other prisoners were turned over to an officer named Julius. He was a member of the high kings' special troops.
\v 2 Aristarchus— who was from the city of Thessalonica in the province of Macedonia, also came with us. Then we boarded a ship that came from the city of Adramyttium, which was going to dock at several harbors along the coast of the province of Asia.
\p
\v 3 We arrived at Sidon the next day. Julius was kind to Paul by allowing him to get off to visit his friends in the city, so that they could give him what he needed.
\v 4 While we were sailing from Sidon, a strong headwind blew, so the ship sailed along the coast of the island of Cyprus, to be protected from the wind.
\v 5 When the ship had crossed the open sea along the coast of the provinces of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we arrived at Myra in the province of Lycia, and we got off the ship.
\v 6 It happened that a ship was there from Alexandria, which was leaving for Italy. Then the officer arranged for all of us to sail with that ship.
\p
\v 7 Because the headwind continued to blow hard, we were forced to sail very slowly for several days, and with great difficulty we arrived near the city of Cnidus. Then because the wind continued to prevent the ship's forward progress, we sailed in a southerly direction. By following the south coast of the island of Crete, near the cape of Salmone, the ship was somewhat protected from the wind.
\v 8 And with great difficulty we sailed the length of the south coast, until we arrived at a place which was called Fair Havens, near the city of Lasea.
\p
\v 9 We had already lost a lot of time, and because it was already past the Jewish Day of Fasting,\f + \fr 27:9 \fk Day of Fasting \ft Another name for the Day of Atonement— which is an important Jewish holiday that happens in the fall. On that holiday, all Jews must fast. That day also became a sign of the beginning of the windy season, when it's dangerous at sea.\f* it was no longer safe to continue the voyage. For that reason, Paul advised Julius and all of the ship's crew, saying,
\v 10 “Brothers, I foresee that if we continue the voyage, there will be a disaster and great loss— not just to the ship and its cargo, but our lives will also be threatened.”
\v 11 But Julius believed the pilot of the ship and the ship's owner more than what Paul said.
\v 12 And that harbor wasn't a good place to stay through the winter, for sure. For that reason, most of the ship's crew chose to continue sailing, and to try to reach the harbor of Phoenix, so that we could all stay there through the winter. That harbor was better protected from the wind because it faced southwest and northwest.
\s Trapped in a typhoon
\p
\v 13 So when the wind began to blow gently from the south, the ship's crew thought they could sail again, according to their plan. For that reason, they raised anchor and sailed again following the south coast of Crete.
\v 14 But not long after that, a typhoon wind— known as “the Northeastern Wind,” blew from the direction of the island.
\v 15 Then the ship was caught in the middle of that typhoon, and the ship couldn't possibly keep sailing anymore against that strong of a wind. So the sailors let the ship be driven by the wind.
\v 16 While we were drifting, and were somewhat protected because of passing the shore of a small island called Cauda, we managed to secure the small boat that was tied to the back of the ship, with great difficulty.
\v 17 After the small boat was pulled aboard the ship, the crew attached strong ropes in loops around the ship. They did that because they were afraid the ship would run aground on shallow sand in a place called Syrtis. So after that, they also lowered the sail and the anchor, so that the ship would be driven more slowly by the wind.
\v 18 But the typhoon and the waves were still beating the ship very hard, so the next day the ship's crew threw the cargo into the sea, to lighten the ship.
\v 19 And on the following day, they even threw some of the ship's tackle into the sea.
\v 20 Day after day, we didn't see the sun or the stars, and the typhoon just kept blowing hard. And we finally lost all hope of being saved.
\p
\v 21 For many days we all didn't eat anything, then Paul stood up among all of us and said, “Brothers, if you had followed my advice not to sail from Crete earlier, we wouldn't have experienced this disaster and loss.
\v 22 But I'm advising you not to give up now. For none of us will be destroyed. Only the ship will be ruined.
\v 23 I'm saying that because last night, the God whom I worship and whose servant I am ordered one of His angels to come and stand by me.
\v 24 The angel said, ‘Paul, don't be afraid. You'll stand before the high king of Rome, for sure. And because of God's kindness to you, He promises that everyone who's sailing with you will be saved.’
\v 25 So brothers, don't give up, because I have faith in God that everything will happen according to what He promised me.
\v 26 But this ship will for certain run aground on some island.”
\p
\v 27 On the fourteenth night— still in the grip of the typhoon, we were driven by the waves to the middle of the Adriatic Sea.\f + \fr 27:27 \fk Adriatic Sea \ft The part of the Mediterranean Sea between the countries of Greece and Italy.\f* At midnight, the ship's crew felt that the ship was approaching land.
\v 28 Then they measured the depth of the sea by dropping a rock line, and its depth appeared to be about thirty seven meters. After sailing a little farther, they measured the depth again, and apparently the sea's depth at that place was only twenty seven meters.\f + \fr 27:28 \fk thirty-seven meters … twenty-seven meters \ft Literally, “twenty fathoms … fifteen fathoms.”\f*
\v 29 Because they were afraid that the ship would run aground on the coral, they lowered four anchors from the back of the ship so that the ship would move forward slowly, and hen they prayed that morning would come quickly.
\v 30 But at that time, the ship's crew lowered the small boat in order to flee from the ship. They deceived us by pretending that they wanted to lower more anchors from the front of the ship.
\v 31 But Paul said to Julius and the other soldiers, “If the ship's crew doesn't stay on board, you won't all be saved.”
\v 32 So the soldiers cut the ropes tied to the boat and let it fall and drift away with the waves.
\p
\v 33 Toward morning, Paul urged us all to eat by saying, “For fourteen days we haven't eaten anything because of waiting fearfully.
\v 34 For that reason, I advise each of you to eat now, in order to have the strength to save yourselves. Not a single one of you will be destroyed. In fact, not even one strand of hair on our heads will be lost.”
\v 35 After he said that, he took bread and gave thanks to God for it in front of everyone. Then he broke the bread, took a piece, and began to eat.
\v 36 Then the rest of us became motivated again and ate bread with Paul.
\v 37 (Those of us who were on the ship numbered two hundred and seventy-six people.)
\v 38 After we had all eaten enough, the ship's crew lightened the ship again by throwing the cargo of wheat into the sea.
\s The ship runs ground and is destroyed
\p
\v 39 Then, when the sun had risen, they saw land that they didn't recognize, but they also saw that there was a bay with a beach. Because of that, they decided to try to land the ship on that beach.
\v 40 So they cut the anchors' ropes and let the anchors sink into the sea. At the same time, they loosened the ropes that tied the steering device of the ship, and they hoisted the sail so that the wind would blow them towards the beach.
\v 41 But in one place where the bottom of the sea wasn't deep, the ship crashed onto the sand so that it stuck. The front of the ship struck the sand very hard, so that it couldn't move at all, while the back of the ship began to break apart because it was pounded by the waves.
\p
\v 42 At that time, the soldiers planned to kill all the prisoners so that none of them would swim to land and escape.
\v 43 But Julius wanted to save Paul. So he forbid them, and ordered that those who could swim should jump into the sea first and swim to land.
\v 44 And the other passengers, who couldn't swim, were ordered to hold onto boards or other pieces of the ship. In that way, everyone arrived safely on the beach.
