\p
\v 1 Then Paul looked stared at the members of the Religious Court council and said, “Brothers, up to this day I've lived well in God's eyes, without feeling guilty in my heart.”
\p
\v 2 Then the high priest, Ananias,\f + \fr 23:2 \fk Ananias \ft Not the person who prayed for Paul in Acts 22:12.\f* ordered one of the people standing next to Paul to slap him on the mouth.
\v 3 Then Paul said to Ananias, “God will slap you, who only pretends to be good!\f + \fr 23:3 \fk the one who only pretends to be good \ft Literally, “a wall painted white.“ Paul used a figure of speech which illustrated Ananias as a dirty wall that's painted white. It means that the condition inside isn't the same as the outside.\f* You sit there to judge me according to the Law, yet you break the Law yourself by ordering someone to slap me.”
\p
\v 4 Then those who stood near Paul said, “You're too daring to insult the high priest, God's servant!”
\p
\v 5 And Paul answered, “Brothers, I didn't know that he was the high priest, for it's written, ‘Don't insult the leader of your people.’\x + Ex. 22:28\x*
\p
\v 6 Paul knew that the members of the council consisted of some from the Sadducee group and some from the Pharisee group, so he cried out, “Brothers, I'm a Pharisee, and my father was also a Pharisee! I'm on trial today because of my conviction— which is that the dead will be brought back to life!”
\p
\v 7 After Paul said that, a huge argument arose between the two groups, and the Court council was divided in two.
\v 8 (That happened because the Sadducee group teach that after people die there won't be any after-life, and they don't believe that there are angels or spirits, but the Pharisees believe in all those things.)
\v 9 Because of that there was a big commotion. Then some of the Law experts, who were also members of the Pharisee group, stood up and protested loudly. They said, “In our opinion, this man isn't guilty at all! Maybe it's true that an angel or a spirit spoke to him.”
\p
\v 10 Eventually the debate grew greater and so dangerous that the commander was afraid Paul would be torn to pieces by them. So he ordered his soldiers to rescue Paul from among them and take him to the barracks.
\p
\v 11 That night the Lord stood beside Paul and said, “Don't be afraid. Just as you've testified about Me in Jerusalem, you'll testify about Me in Rome too.”
\s The Jews make plans to kill Paul
\p
\v 12 The next morning, the Jews secretly made plans to kill Paul. They swore to God that they wouldn't eat or drink before they succeeded in killing Paul.
\v 13 There were more than forty people who made a pact under oath like that.
\v 14 Then they went to the chief priests and the Jewish leaders to say, “We have sworn before God that we won't eat or drink anything at all until we succeed in killing Paul.
\v 15 Now, in the name of the Religious Court council, ask the commander of the troops that Paul be brought to you again, as if you want to examine his case more carefully. But he won't arrive here, because we're ready to kill him on the way before he gets here.”
\p
\v 16 But Paul's nephew heard about that plan. (He was Paul's sister's son.) So he went to the barracks and told Paul the situation.
\v 17 Then Paul called one of the officers and said, “Please take this young man to the commander, because he wants to tell him something.”
\p
\v 18 So the officer brought him to the commander and said, “That prisoner, Paul, called me and asked me to bring this young man to you. He wants to tell you something.”
\p
\v 19 So the commander took the hand of the young man and drew him aside, and asked, “What do you want to tell me?”
\p
\v 20 And the young man said, “ Sir, the Jews have made plans to ask you to bring Paul to the Religious Court tomorrow morning. They'll pretend that they want to examine his case more carefully.
\v 21 But don't listen to them, Sir, because more than forty of the them have made plans to attack him on the way. They've sworn that they won't eat or drink until they succeed in killing Paul. And now they're ready, and are just waiting for your decision, Sir.”
\p
\v 22 So the commander told the young man to go home, and ordered, “Don't tell anyone at all that you've told me this.”
\s Paul is sent to Caesarea
\p
\v 23-24 Then the commander called two of his officers and said, “Prepare three groups of soldiers to take Paul safely to Governor Felix in Caesarea. The three groups will consist of two hundred swordmen, two hundred spearmen, and seventy horsemen. Prepare some horses for Paul and all of his needs too.\f + \fr 23:24 \fk his needs \ft It isn't known why some horses were prepared for Paul. The other horses might have been for Paul's friends who went with in order to take care of Paul's needs in jail. Or the other horses might have been to carry his possessions.\f* Be ready to leave at nine o'clock tonight.”
\v 25 Then the commander wrote a letter which said this,
\mi
\v 26 “To the glorious and respected Governor Felix: Greetings from Claudius Lysias.
\mi
\v 27 I'm sending a prisoner along with this letter. This man was captured by the Jewish people, and they intended to kill him. But I came with my soldiers to rescue him, because I heard that he's a Roman citizen.
\mi
\v 28 I wanted to know why he was accused by them, so I brought him to the council of their Religious Court.
\mi
\v 29 They're apparently accusing him because of some problems in their Law, but he wasn't accused of anything that deserves to be punished by death or imprisonment.
\mi
\v 30 When I was informed that the Jews made plans to kill him, I immediately sent him to you, Sir. I've also ordered those who accuse him to tell you all of their accusations, Sir.”
\p
\v 31 According to the order that was given to them, the soldiers took Paul to the city of Antipatris that night.
\v 32 The next day, the troop with horses continued the trip with Paul, while the other four hundred soldiers returned to the barracks.
\v 33 When the seventy horsemen, with Paul, arrived in Caesarea, they handed Paul and the letter over to the governor.
\v 34 After the governor had read the letter, he asked Paul, “What province are you from?” When Paul answered that he was from the province of Cilicia,
\v 35 the governor said, “I'll hear your case when the people who accuse you have arrived here.” Then he gave an order that Paul be kept as a prisoner in the government building that was built by King Herod.
