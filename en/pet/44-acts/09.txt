\s Saul repents
\p
\v 1 However, Saul still continued to threaten the followers of the Lord by saying that he was going to kill them. For that reason, Saul went to the high priest,
\v 2 and asked to to be given a letter of authority addressed to the leaders of all the Jewish synagogues in the city of Damascus. In that letter, it stated that when he found Jesus' followers—\f + \fr 9:2 \fk Jesus' followers \ft Literally, “people (followers) of the way.” According to Saul and the high priest, they followed an erroneous way, or according to the writer Luke, they followed the way of salvation taught by the Lord Jesus.\f* whether men or women, he would arrest them and bring them back to Jerusalem to be tried.
\p
\v 3 As Saul was getting close to the city, a light from the sky suddenly shone around him.
\v 4 Then Saul fell to the ground and heard a voice that said, “Saul, Saul, why're you persecuting Me?”
\p
\v 5 And Saul asked, “Who are You, Lord?”
\p Then the voice answered, “I'm Jesus, whom you're persecuting.
\v 6 Now get up and go into the city. And you'll be told what you have to do there.”
\p
\v 7 The people who were with him on that trip just stood there and were so afraid that they weren't able to say anything. They heard that voice, but they didn't see the Person who was speaking.
\v 8 Then Saul got up from the ground. But when he opened his eyes, he couldn't see anything at all anymore. So the people who were with him held his hand and led him to the city of Damascus.
\v 9 After that, Saul couldn't see for three days, and he also didn't eat or drink.
\p
\v 10 There was a follower of Jesus in Damascus, whose name was Ananias. The Lord called to him in a vision, “Ananias!”
\p Then Ananias answered, “I'm here, Lord.”
\p
\v 11 And the Lord said to him, “Stand up and go to the street called Straight Street. Look for the house of a person named Judas.\f + \fr 9:11 \fk Judas \ft The Judas intended here was not one of the twelve apostles.\f* Tell a person at his house that you want to meet a man named Saul— a man from the city of Tarsus. He's praying to Me now.
\v 12 And Saul has seen a man named Ananias come to him in a vision, and lay his hands on him, so that he can see again.”
\p
\v 13 But Ananias answered, “Lord, I've heard many things about that man! He has severely persecuted Your people in Jerusalem.
\v 14 And he came here, bringing a letter of authority from the chief priests, to arrest everyone who believes in You.”
\p
\v 15 But the Lord said to him, “Go, because I've chosen him to be My servant, so that he'll tell about Me to non-Jewish people, and to kings, and also to Jewish people.
\v 16 And I Myself will show him just how much suffering he must experience because of serving Me.”
\p
\v 17 So Ananias went to Judas' house to meet Saul. Then he laid his hands on him and said, “Saul, my brother, the Lord Jesus sent me to you. He's the one you saw on your trip here. He sent me so that you can see again and be filled with the Holy Spirit.”
\v 18 Then there was something like fish scales that suddenly fell from Saul's eyes, and he could see again. After that he got up, and Ananias baptized him.
\v 19 Then Saul ate and felt strong again.
\s Saul begins to tell about Jesus in Damascus
\p Then Saul stayed several days with the followers of Jesus in Damascus.
\v 20 He immediately went to the synagogue of the Jews and began to tell about Jesus saying, “Jesus is God's Son.”
\p
\v 21 Everyone who heard him was amazed and said, “Isn't he the one who's trying to destroy those who believe in Jesus in Jerusalem?! That's why he came here— to arrest them and bring them to the chief priests!”
\p
\v 22 But the Lord gave more and more wisdom and ability to Saul to convince people through his teaching, and when he debated with the Jews in Damascus, no one could defeat him, because he proved that Jesus is the Christ,\f + \fr 9:22 \fk Christ \ft See the footnote about the Christ in Acts 2:36.\f* whom God had promised.
\s Saul escapes from the Jews in Damascus
\p
\v 23 After several days had passed, the Jews in Damascus made plans to kill Saul.
\v 24 They guarded the city gates day and night, in order to kill him. But then Saul found out about their plan.
\v 25 And one night, the people who were following Saul's teaching helped him to escape from the city. They lowered him in a large basket through an opening that was in the city wall.
\s Saul in Jerusalem
\p
\v 26 When Saul arrived in Jerusalem, he tried to join with the other believers, but they were all afraid of him. They didn't believe that he had become Jesus' follower.
\v 27 But Barnabas brought him to the apostles and told how Saul had seen the Lord on the trip to Damascus. Barnabas also told them that the Lord had spoken to Saul, and that Saul had spoken about Jesus boldly in Damascus.
\p
\v 28 So, Saul joined them and often went with them everywhere in Jerusalem, and he always spoke about the Lord boldly.
\v 29 But he often debated with some Jews who spoke the Greek language, until they finally tried to kill him.
\v 30 When the other brothers in the faith heard about that, they took Saul to Caesarea, then sent him to Tarsus.
\p
\v 31 After that, all of the believers in all Judea, Galilee and Samaria lived with a feeling of calm in God's protection. They lived feeling full of respect for the Lord Jesus, and the Holy Spirit always encouraged them, so that their numbers increased more and more.
\s Peter in the cities of Lydda and Joppa
\p
\v 32 At that time, Peter visited all the regions around Jerusalem, and went to visit the believers in Lydda.
\v 33 There he met a man named Aeneas who for eight years had beein totally paralyzed and couldn't get out of his bed.
\v 34 Peter said to him, “Aeneas, Christ Jesus heals you. Stand up and straighten up your bed.” And he immediately got up.
\v 35 Then everyone who lived in Lydda and Sharon saw that Aeneas had been healed, so they repented and returned to the Lord.
\p
\v 36 In the city of Joppa there lived a follower of Jesus whose Jewish name was Tabitha. (In Greek Tabitha is called Dorcas, which means ‘small deer’.) This woman always did good things for other people and often helped poor people.
\v 37 While Peter was in Lydda, Tabitha became very sick and died. Then the other women washed her body according to Jewish custom and placed her body in an upstairs room.
\v 38 The city of Lydda was near Joppa. So when the believers heard that Peter was in Lydda, they sent two people there. Then they really begged him, “Please come quickly.”
\v 39 So Peter got ready and went with them. When he arrived there, Peter was taken to the room upstairs. All the widows stood around Peter there. While they were crying, they showed him the robes and other clothes that Dorcas made for them while she was still alive.
\v 40 After Peter ordered everyone out of the room, he knelt down and prayed. Then he looked toward the body and said, “Tabitha, get up.” Then Tabitha opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter, she woke and sat up.
\v 41 Then Peter stretched out his hand and helped Tabitha to stand up. So Peter called the believers and the widows, and showed them that Tabitha had come back to life.
\p
\v 42 The news about that miracle spread to the whole city of Joppa, and many people became believers in the Lord.
\v 43 After that, Peter stayed quite awhile with a person named Simon, a person who prepared animal skins, in Joppa.
