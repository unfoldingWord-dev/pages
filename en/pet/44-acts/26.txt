\s Paul defends himself before King Agrippa
\p
\v 1 Then Agrippa said to Paul, “You may speak to defend yourself.”
\p Then Paul raised his hand as a sign that he was beginning to defend himself. He said,
\v 2 “Exalted King Agrippa, I'm really happy that I can stand before you today, to defend myself against all of the accusations that have been given by the Jews—
\v 3 especially because you, know about all the customs of the Jews and the things that cause differences of opinion among them in depth. For that reason, I'm asking you to listen to me patiently, Sir.
\p
\v 4 “All the Jews know my education and my way of life as a Jew, because I lived among them since I was young— first in my city Tarsus, and then in Jerusalem.
\v 5 They've known me for a long time, and if they want to testify, they can tell you that I've lived well as a member of the Pharisee group— which is the strictest group of our religion.
\v 6 And now, I stand here to be tried precisely because of my belief— which is that God will fulfill one of the most important promises which He promised to our forefathers in times past.
\v 7 In the same way, our twelve tribes still truly hope this promise will be fulfilled. That is the reason they sincerely worship God day and night. Yet paradocally it's because of that same hope, King Agripa, that I've been accused by my own people!
\v 8 So I'm asking all of you: Why is it so difficult for you to believe that God has the power to make dead people alive again?
\p
\v 9 “Actually, I also used to think that all Jews were obligated to take strong actions to oppose everything that was done in the name of Jesus, the Nazarene.
\v 10 That's what I did in Jerusalem too. With the authority I received from the chief priests, I put many of God's people\f + \fr 26:10 \fk God's people \ft Literally, “holy people.” This means people who fully believe in Jesus and have been purified by Him.\f* in jail. And when they were being judged by the Religious Court, I was also on the side of the leaders who demanded that they be sentenced to death.
\v 11 In fact, I often tortured them in the synagogues too, and tried to force them to insult the name of Jesus. Anger controlled me completely, so that I chased them to other cities.
\s Paul tells that he saw Jesus
\p
\v 12 “That's why I went to Damascus with letters of permission and full authority from the chief priests.
\v 13 But, your majesty, around the mid-day on that trip, a light from heaven— which was brighter than the sun, shone on me and on those who traveled with me.
\v 14 We all fell to the ground, and I heard a voice that spoke to me in the Hebrew language, ‘Saul, Saul, why're you persecuting Me? You're just like a cow that is always kicking the sharp stick of its master. By opposing My will, you're causing trouble for yourself.’
\p
\v 15 “Then I asked, ‘Who are You, Lord?’
\p “And the Lord answered, ‘I'm Jesus, whom you're persecuting.
\v 16 But now get up! I have shown Myself to you because I have chosen you to serve Me. And you'll tell your testimony about what you've seen and what I'll show you later on.
\v 17 I'll save you from the people who oppose you— both those who come from the Jewish people and non-Jewish people. And now I'm sending you to non-Jewish people,
\v 18 to make them aware, so that they'll no longer live in darkness but live in the light. And so that they'll no longer be controlled by the devil either, but will be controlled by God. In that way, their sins will be forgiven, and they'll take part with those who're being purified because of fully believing in Me.’
\s Paul explains about his work
\p
\v 19 “For that reason, my King Agrippa, I've definitely tried to be obedient to the vision that was given from heaven.
\v 20 So I began to teach the news of salvation, first among the people in Damascus, then in Jerusalem, then in the whole province of Judea, and also in the regions that aren't Jewish. I told them that they must repent of their sins and turn to the Lord, and do the things that show they truly have repented.
\v 21 That's why the Jews captured me in God's Temple and tried to kill me.
\v 22 But to this day, God has always protected me, so that I can stand here and testify to all of you— both to people of low and high status. And I only announce what has been prophesied by the prophets and Moses—
\v 23 which is that God's plan was that the Christ suffer and die, and after that He would be the first One to come back to life after death. Then the news of salvation would become like a bright light that shines on both the Jewish and non-Jewish people groups.”
\s Paul urges King Agrippa to become a follower of Christ
\p
\v 24 While Paul was defending himself like that, Festus said in a loud voice, “Paul, you're crazy! You've studied religion so much that you've become insane.”
\p
\v 25 But Paul answered, “I'm not insane, my ruler, Exalted Festus! What I'm saying is true and makes sense.
\v 26 His majesty King Agrippa already knows about these things too, and because of that I can speak frankly with him. And I'm sure that he hasn't just recently heard about these things, because all of this is already well known by the public.
\v 27 Now King Agrippa, do you believe what was prophesied by the prophets? I'm sure you believe those things!”
\p
\v 28 Then Agrippa answered Paul, “Do you think that you can persuade me to become a Christian in such a short time?”
\p
\v 29 And Paul answered, “Whether it takes a short time or a long time, I pray to God that not just you, but everyone who hears me today may become like me, but not be bound with iron chains like these.”
\p
\v 30-31 After Paul said that, King Agrippa stood up and began to walk out. Then Bernice, Governor Festus, and everyone who sat with them stood up and left the room. Once outside, they said to each other, “This man hasn't done any crime requiring him to be sentenced to death or be imprisoned.”
\p
\v 32 Then King Agrippa said to Festus, “If this man hadn't asked that his case be judged by the high king, he could actually have been released.”
