\s Timothy accompanies Paul and Silas
\p
\v 1 Then Paul went to the cities of Derbe and Lystra too. And there was a follower of Christ there named Timothy. His mother was a Jew who had already believed in Jesus, but his father was a Greek.
\v 2 All of the brothers and sisters in the faith in Lystra and Iconium said that Timothy was a good person.
\v 3 Paul wanted Timothy to go with the two of them. So he circumcised Timothy so that the Jews would accept him. Paul didn't want to cause a problem, because everyone in that region knew that Timothy's father was a Greek.
\v 4 As they visited from one city to another city, they told the churches about the rules that had been determined by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem.
\v 5 In that way, the churches were strengthened in their faith, and the number of believers increased everyday.
\s Paul's vision about the needs of people in the province of Macedonia
\p
\v 6 Then Paul and those who were with him took a trip through the provinces of Phrygia and Galatia, because they were forbidden by the Holy Spirit to tell the news of salvation in the province of Asia.
\v 7 When they arrived at the border of the province of Mysia, they tried to go into the province of Bithynia. But once again Jesus' Spirit\f + \fr 16:7 \fk Jesus' Spirit \ft In the Greek language, verse 6 says “Holy Spirit”— that is God's Spirit, whereas this verse says “Jesus' Spirit.” Because of the unity between God the Father and His Son, there's no difference, and the two names indicate the same Person.\f* didn't allow them to go there.
\v 8 For that reason, they went past Mysia until they arrived at the harbor city of Troas.
\v 9 That night, the Lord gave Paul a vision. He saw a man from the province of Macedonia standing and begging him, “Come to Macedonia and help us!”
\v 10 Then after Paul had that vision, we— including me, Luke,\f + \fr 16:10 \fk we … \ft By using “we” where “they” was previously used, Luke showed that he went along on the trip with Paul from Troas. It's clear in verse 40 too, that he didn't go with when Paul left the city of Philippi. But Luke joined Paul again in 20:5-21:18 and 27:1-28.\f* immediately got ready to leave for Macedonia, because from that vision we concluded that God had called us to tell the Good News to the Macedonian people.
\s Lydia believes in Jesus
\p
\v 11 Then we got on a boat from Troas and sailed directly to the island of Samothrace, and on the following day we arrived in the city of Neapolis.
\v 12 From there we walked to the city of Philippi— which was the most important city in Macedonia, and a city where the residents were considered by the government to be Roman citizens.\f + \fr 16:12 \fk Roman citizens \ft The city of Philippi was started by residents of Rome who moved there, so they were still considered to be Roman citizens and had special rights.\f* We stayed there for several days.
\p
\v 13 On the Sabbath Day, we went out through the city gate to the river side. Because that city didn't yet have a Jewish synagogue, we thought that there might be a place there for them to gather and pray every Sabbath Day. When we found that place, we sat and talked with some women who had gathered there.
\v 14 One of them was a woman named Lydia, who came from the city of Thyatira. She sold purple cloth, and she had already become a worshiper of God, even though she wasn't a Jew. When she heard Paul, the Lord opened her heart, and she believed what Paul taught.
\v 15 So she and everyone who lived in her house were baptized. Then Lydia invited us to her house. She said, “If you think that I really do believe in the Lord Jesus, come and stay at my house.” And we gladly agreed to stay at her house.
\s Paul and Silas in jail
\p
\v 16 Another day, while we were going to that place of prayer by the river side, we were met by a clairvoyant woman, and that woman was a slave owned by several masters. That woman was possessed by a demon who made her able to predict what was going to happen in the future. And every person who came to the clairvoyant woman to tell their future had to first give money to her masters. So the masters made a lot of money because of that clairvoyant woman.
\v 17 She kept following Paul and us too, while shouting over and over again, “These men are servants of the Most High God. They're telling us about the way of salvation.”
\v 18 She did that day after day, until Paul couldn't restrain his anger any longer. So Paul turned around and said to that demon, “In the name of Christ Jesus, I command you to come out of this woman!” And the demon immediately came out.
\p
\v 19 But when the woman's masters saw that they wouldn't get any more profit as the result of her work, they captured Paul and Silas, and dragged the two of them to a public meeting place in the market to face the city officials.
\v 20 Then the masters said, to the officials, “These men are Jews who are upsetting the residents of this city!
\v 21 They're teaching Jewish customs, and as Roman citizens it is not proper for us to follow or practice those things!”
\p
\v 22 Then the crowd also took part in opposing the two apostles. And the officials tore Paul and Silas' clothes so that they were naked, then commanded that the two of them be beaten with rods.
\v 23 After being beaten harshly many times, they were put in jail. The city officials ordered the jailer to guard them closely.
\v 24 Because of that command, the jailer put Paul and Silas in the innermost and safest room in the building. Then their feet were put in stocks.
\p
\v 25 But about midnight, Paul and Silas were praying and singing praise songs to God, and the other prisoners heard them.
\v 26 Suddenly there was an earthquake so strong that the foundation stones of the jail were shaken. All of the jail doors opened, and all of the prisoners' chains came loose.
\v 27 Then the jailer woke up. When he saw that the doors of the jail were open, he took out his sword to kill himself,\f + \fr 16:27 \fk kill himself \ft The jailer wanted to kill himself because he was afraid of receiving punishment from the authorities. At that time, if prisoners escaped or were let go, the one guarding them would be killed.\f* because he thought that all of the prisoners had run away.
\v 28 But Paul said to him in a loud voice, “Hey, Sir, don't kill yourself! We're all still here.”
\p
\v 29 Then after the jailer ordered his servant to bring a lamp, he ran inside, and trembling with fear he knelt down before Paul and Silas.
\v 30 Then he accompanied the two of them out and asked, “What do I have to do to be saved, Sirs?”
\p
\v 31 Then they answered, “Believe in the Lord Jesus, then you'll be saved. And everyone who lives in your house should do the same thing.”
\v 32-34 Then that very night, the jailer brought the two of them to his house, cleaned their wounds and gave them food. So they told the Good News about the Lord Jesus to him and to everyone who lived in his house. Then he and the others were baptized, and all of them were glad because they had believed in God.
\p
\v 35 Then the next morning, the officials sent some city peace officers to the jailer to tell him, “Release those two men.”
\p
\v 36 Then the head of the jail told Paul, “The officials have ordered that you're to be released, Sirs. So now you may go out and leave safely.”
\p
\v 37 Then Paul said to the peace officers, “We're Roman citizens,\f + \fr 16:37 \fk Roman citizens \ft The laws of Rome determined that Roman citizens couldn't be beaten before being tried.\f* but the city officials ordered us to be beaten in public, and that was done without finding any fault with us! Then they put us in jail without a reason. And now they want us to go away quietly. We certainly don't want to! They have to come here themselves and escort us out!”
\p
\v 38 Then the peace officers went and reported Paul's words to the officials. When they heard that Paul and Silas were Roman citizens, they were afraid, because they could be punished if that was reported to their superiors.
\v 39 So they came and apologized. After escorting Paul and Silas out of the jail, they asked the two of them to leave the city.
\v 40 After that, they went to Lydia's house. And when they had met and encouraged the brothers and sisters in the faith, they left the city.
