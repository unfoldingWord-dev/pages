\s Barnabas and Saul are given a special task
\p
\v 1 At that time, there were several brothers and sisters in the faith in Antioch who had the special ability to prophesy or teach God's Word. They were Barnabas, Saul, Simeon— who was also called Niger, Lucius— who came from Cyrene, and Manaen. This is the Manaen who had been brought up together with King Herod.
\v 2 While they were taking part in a special meeting to praise the Lord and were fasting, the Holy Spirit said to them, “Appoint Barnabas and Saul to do the task that I've prepared for them.”
\p
\v 3 So after more fasting and prayer, they laid their hands on Barnabas and Saul as a sign that they had been surrendered and sent to do that task.
\s Barnabas and Saul on the island of Cyprus
\p
\v 4 Because they were sent out by the Holy Spirit, they went to Seleucia, and from there they sailed to the island of Cyprus.
\v 5 When they arrived at the city of Salamis, they told the news of salvation from God in the synagogues of the Jews. Mark— the one who was called John, also went along to help them.
\p
\v 6-8 Then they visited every place on the island until they arrived at the city of Paphos. There they met a sorcerer and false prophet whose name was Bar-Jesus— who was also called Elymas in the Greek language. He was a Jew. He had become a friend of the governor of that island whose name was Sergius— who was also called Paul, an intelligent man. Then the governor called for Barnabas and Saul because he wanted to hear news from God. But Elymas opposed the two of them, and tried to keep the governor from believing in Jesus.
\v 9 However Saul— who was also called Paul, was controlled by the Holy Spirit at that moment and looked at Elymas,
\v 10 and rebuked him, “You're the devil's son! Your heart is full of lies and false teaching. You're an enemy of everything that's right! When will you stop twisting the Lord's way!
\v 11 Look out! The Lord is striking you now, and you'll become blind for a while. In fact, you won't be able to see the sunshine.”
\p Then suddenly, something like a dark fog covered Elymas. And he walked around feeling and trying to find someone to hold his hand and lead him away.
\v 12 When the governor saw what happened, he became a believer in Jesus, because he was truly amazed at the teaching about the Lord Jesus.
\s Paul and Barnabas go to Antioch in the province of Pisidia
\p
\v 13 From the city of Paphos, Paul and his friends sailed to Perga, in the province of Pamphylia. Mark suddenly left them there and returned to Jerusalem.
\v 14 From Perga, Paul and Barnabas went to Antioch, in the province of Pisidia. On the Sabbath Day, they entered the Jewish synagogue and sat down there.
\v 15 After the reading from the Law, and one of the prophets writings, the leaders of the synagogue sent a message to Paul and Barnabas. They said, “Brothers, if one of you two can give some advice to encourage us here, please speak now.”
\p
\v 16 Then Paul stood up and signaled with his hand that he wanted to speak, saying, “Jews and non-Jews who've become worshipers of God, listen to me!
\v 17 The God of the people of Israel chose our forefathers. He blessed them while they lived as foreigners in Egypt, so that they became a great people group. Then He brought them out of that land with His gread power.
\v 18 And during the forty years that they stayed in the desert, God remained patient with their evil behavior.
\v 19 Then God destroyed the seven people groups that were in the land of Canaan, and gave that land to the people of Israel to become their possession.
\v 20 That all happened over a period of four hundred and fifty years.
\p “After that, God raised up judges to lead them until the time of the last judge— that is Samuel, who was also a prophet.
\v 21 At that time the people of Israel asked to be led by a king. Then God appointed Saul— the son of Kish from the tribe of Benjamin, and he led them for forty years.
\v 22 But when God brought Saul down from his throne, He raised up David as king. And this is what God said about David, ‘I know that David, Jesse's son, has a heart that's in agreement with My heart's desires. He's the one who'll do everything I want.’
\p
\v 23 “So as God Himself had promised, He raised up One of David's descendants to save Israel— that is Jesus.
\v 24 Before His coming, John taught that all the Israelites must be baptized as a sign that they had repented from their sins.
\v 25 And when John had almost finished his task, he asked, ‘In your opinion, what position am I in? I'm not the One you're waiting for. But He will come after me. I am not worthy to serve Him— not even to untie the straps of His sandals.’
\p
\v 26 “Brothers and sisters from Abraham's descendants, and you non-Jewish people who've become worshipers of God: This news about salvation was sent to us by God!
\v 27 But the people of Jerusalem, along with their leaders, didn't realize that Jesus was the King of Salvation. They also didn't understand the writings of the prophets which are read every Sabbath Day. Then without realizing it, they fulfilled what the prophets had prophesied when they invoked the death sentence on Him.
\v 28 Although they didn't find any reason at all to kill Jesus, they kept pressing Pilate to have Him be killed.
\p
\v 29 “Finally after without being aware of it they had done all that the prophets had written about Him, they took Him down from the cross and laid His body in a stone tomb.
\v 30 But God raised Him up from death.
\v 31 During several days afterward, He repeatedly showed Himself to the people who had followed Him when He went from Galilee to Jerusalem. And it's those people who are now telling about Him to the people of Israel.
\p
\v 32 “So now we're telling you the Good News that God had promised to our forefathers.
\v 33 Now, for us descendants of theirs, God has fulfilled His promise when He caused Jesus to live again after death. That agrees with what's written in the Second Psalm, which says,
\q1 ‘You're My Son,
\q2 today I announce that I'm Your Father.’\x + Ps. 2:7\x*
\m
\v 34 And according to God's promise, He raised Jesus from death, so that His body wouldn't rot in the grave. For God had promised us,
\q1 ‘I'll give you a blessing that's holy and worthy to be believed—
\q2 which is what I had promised David.’\x + Is. 55:3\x*
\m
\v 35 So David also says to God in another place in the book of Psalms,
\q1 ‘You won't allow the body of Your holy Servant to rot in the grave.’\x + Ps. 16:10\x*
\m
\v 36 Those words aren't about David himself, because after he had served God all of his life, he died too. And his tomb is in the same place where his family was buried. So the body of David did rot there, of course.
\v 37 But the One whom God meant is Jesus! He's the One whom God cause to live again after death and whose body didn't rot in the grave!
\v 38 So Brothers and Sisters, you also need to know that it is only through Jesus that our sins can be forgiven.
\v 39 That means that all of our sins which couldn't be erased in the past through sacrifices which were offered according to Moses' Law have now been erased for each one who believes in Jesus. It is only through believing in Jesus that we become right in God's eyes!
\v 40 For that reason, you should watch out, Brothers and Sisters, so that what God told through His prophet doesn't happen to you:
\q1
\v 41 ‘Pay careful attention, you who like to mock when you hear My Word!
\q2 You'll be amazed, and then disappear from this world.
\q1 Because I'm doing something in this age
\q2 that you couldn't possibly believe—
\q2 even if someone explained it to you.’”\x + Hab. 1:5\x*
\p
\v 42 When Paul and Barnabas went out of the synagogue, they were asked repeatedly to speak about the same thing again on the next Sabbath Day.
\v 43 While they were dispersing from the synagogue, many Jews and worshipers of God who had joined the Jewish religion followed Paul and Barnabas. The two apostles taught and emphasized that those people should keep holding on to God's kindness which was given to us through Jesus.
\p
\v 44 The following Sabbath Day, almost all of the people in that city gathered to hear the preaching of God's Word.
\v 45 But when some of the Jews who didn't yet believe in Jesus saw how many people came to listen to Paul, they became very jealous. Then they opposed and mocked what he taught.
\v 46 But Paul and Barnabas spoke boldly, “It was necessary that the Good News from God be given to you Jews first. But because you don't want to receive it, it means you considere yourselves unworthy to receive eternal life. Because of that, we're leaving you now and going to serve the people groups who aren't Jewish.
\v 47 For God has commanded us by saying,
\q1 ‘I've given you the job to enlighten people who aren't Jews,
\q2 so that you will tell the news of salvation to the ends of the earth.’ ”\x + Is. 49:6\x*
\p
\v 48 When the non-Jewish people heard that, they were happy and praised God for the news. And everyone who was appointed by God to receive eternal life became believers.
\p
\v 49 Then the news of salvation about the Lord Jesus spread to that whole region.
\v 50 But the Jews who weren't happy with the two of them stirred up the important people of that city, including prominent women who had already joined the Jewish religion. They caused persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and finally drove the two of them out of that region.
\v 51 However, Paul and Barnabas shook the dust off their feet\f + \fr 13:51 \fk shook the dust off their feet \ft this was a warning to the residents of a city or village who would bear God's punishment. For when messengers of God's Word came telling the news of salvation, the residents of that village or city didn't want to hear it. That was also a sign that the messengers were free from blame, because they faithfully told that news.\f* as a warning to the residents of that city that God would punish them. Then they went to the city of Iconium.
\v 52 But the new followers of Jesus in Antioch continued to live with joy, and were controlled by the Holy Spirit.
