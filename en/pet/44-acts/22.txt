\c 22
\s Paul defends himself before the crowd
\p
\v 1 “Brothers and Fathers, listen to what I want to tell you to defend myself.”
\p
\v 2 When they heard that he spoke in the Hebrew language, they became even more calm.
\p Then he continued speaking,
\v 3 “I'm a Jew, who was born in the province of Cilicia in the city of Tarsus, but I was raised in this city. I'm a student of Gamaliel,\f + \fr 22:3 \fk Gamaliel \ft One of the teachers in the Jewish religious group which was called the Pharisees. (See Acts 5:34.)\f* and I was strictly educated according to the laws of our forefathers. So I sincerely obey God, just like you do today.
\v 4 For that reason, I persecuted all the followers of the ‘way' which was taught by Jesus— to the point of taking part in killing them. I also arrested them and put them in jail— both men and women.
\v 5 And the high priest, along with all the Jewish leaders, can testify about that, because I received letters from them which were addressed to the leaders of the synagogues in Damascus, so that when I came, I could arrest and tie up people who followed that movement, and bring them to Jerusalem to be punished.
\p
\v 6 “But while I was on my way, nearing Damascus at about noon, suddenly a very bright light from the sky shone on me.
\v 7 Then I fell to the ground and heard a voice that said, ‘Saul, Saul, why're you persecuting Me?’
\p
\v 8 “I answered, ‘Who're You, Lord?’
\p Then He answered, ‘I am Jesus the Nazarene, whom you're persecuting.’
\v 9 Those who were with me saw the light too, but they didn't hear the voice that spoke to me.
\p
\v 10 “Then I asked, ‘What should I do, Lord?’
\p And the Lord answered, ‘Get up and go to Damascus. You'll be told there all the things that I've planned for you to do.’
\p
\v 11 “But because the light was so brilliant, my eyes became blind. So those who were with me led me to Damascus.
\v 12 In Damascus, there was a man named Ananias.\f + \fr 22:12 \fk Ananias \ft There are three people named Ananias in the book of Acts. The other two are found in Acts. 5:1 and 23:2.\f* He was a person who was very faithful to obey the Law, and all of the Jews who lived there respected him.
\v 13 He came and stood beside me and said, ‘Brother Saul, may you see again!’ And at that very moment, I could see him.
\p
\v 14 “Then Ananias said to me, ‘The God of our forefathers has chosen you to know His will, and hear Jesus' voice, and see Him who always lives right in God's sight.
\v 15 For He has chosen you to give your testimony to everyone about what you've seen and heard.
\v 16 So now what're you waiting for?! Stand up and be baptized. Pray to the Lord Jesus so that you'll be cleansed from your sins.’
\p
\v 17 “After I returned to Jerusalem, and while I was praying in God's Temple, I had a vision.
\v 18 And I saw Jesus in that vision, who said, ‘Leave Jerusalem quickly, because the people here won't accept your testimony about Me.’
\p
\v 19 “But I answered, ‘Lord, they know that I've gone into the synagogues to arrest people who believe in You. Then I beat them and put them in jail.
\v 20 And when Stephen, Your faithful witness was killed, I stood there and agreed that he be killed. In fact, I guarded the robes of those murderers.’
\p
\v 21 “Then Jesus said to me, ‘Go, because I'll send you to distant places— which is to non-Jewish people groups.’”
\p
\v 22 The crowd listened to Paul until he mentioned “non-Jewish people groups.” Then they all shouted loudly, “Destroy this man! He isn't fit to live anymore!”
\v 23 While shouting, they took off their robes and threw dust into the air.\f + \fr 22:23 \fk took off their robes … threw dust … \ft Their actions showed that they were very angry at Paul, and ready to take harsh action.\f*
\v 24 At that moment, the commander ordered that Paul be taken into the barracks. Then he gave the command that Paul be whipped while being examined, in order to find out why the crowd shouted like that at him.
\v 25 But when the soldiers tied up Paul to whip him, he asked one of the officers who stood there, “Are you allowed to whip a Roman citizen before he has been tried?”
\p
\v 26 When the officer heard Paul's words, he went to the commander of the troops and said, “Sir, please think carefully about what you're doing to that man! He's a Roman citizen.”
\p
\v 27 So the commander came to Paul and asked, “Tell me: Is it true that you're a Roman citizen?”
\p “It's true,” Paul answered.
\p
\v 28 Then the commander mocked what Jewish prisoners usually said, by saying, “And now you'll say that you've paid a very high price to become a Roman citizen.”\f + \fr 22:28 \fk Verse 28 \ft The answer of the commander is translated so that his words are sarcastic. More literally he said, “I had to pay a high price to receive this citizenship.”\f*
\p But Paul answered, “No, I was born a Roman citizen.”
\p
\v 29 When they heard that answer, those who had been ordered to whip him stepped back immediately. And the commander became afraid when he realized that Paul— whom he had ordered be be tied up without examining him, was a Roman citizen.
\s Paul defends himself before the Jewish Religious Court council
\p
\v 30 But the commander wanted to know why Paul was accused by the Jewish people. So the next day he ordered all of the chief priests and the whole Religious Court council to get together. Then he ordered Paul to stand in front of them, without being tied with chains.
