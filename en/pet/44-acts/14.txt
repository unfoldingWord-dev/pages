\s Paul and Barnabas in Iconium, the capital city of Lycaonia province
\p
\v 1 When they arrived in Iconium, Paul and Barnabas went to the Jewish synagogue and taught about Jesus there, just as they had done in Antioch. They taught with full authority so that many Jewish and non-Jewish people believed in Jesus.
\v 2 But some of the Jews who didn't believe stirred up the non-Jewish people, so that they weren't happy with the believers.
\v 3 But Paul and Barnabas stayed there a long time, and taught boldly about the Lord's kindness. And the Lord strengthened their testimony by giving them power to do many miracles.
\v 4 Finally, the residents of the city were divided into two groups, because there were those who sided with the Jews, and those who sided with the two apostles.
\p
\v 5 Then some of the Jewish and non-Jewish people along with the leaders of the city agreed to torture and stone Paul and Barnabas.
\v 6 But when the two apostles heard about that plan, they ran away to another region in the province of Lycaonia— namely to the region around the cities of Lystra and Derbe.
\v 7 And they kept telling the Good News about Jesus there.
\s Paul in the cities of Lystra and Derbe
\p
\v 8 In Lystra there was a man who had been paralyzed since birth, and had never walked.
\v 9 While the man was listening to Paul speak, Paul looked at him and realized that the man had faith that he could be healed.
\v 10 Then Paul said in a loud voice, “Stand up on your feet!” And the paralyzed man immediately stood up and began walking around.
\p
\v 11 When the crowd saw what Paul had done, they shouted in the Lycaonian language, “The gods have come down to us in human form!”
\v 12 Then they began to call Barnabas by the name “Zeus,”\f + \fr 14:12 \fk Zeus \ft The most important of the Greek gods.\f* and Paul by the name Hermes,\f + \fr 14:12 \fk Hermes \ft A Greek god. The Greeks believed that Hermes was the speaker for the other gods.\f* because he was the one who talked a lot.
\v 13 It happened that the house of worship for the god Zeus was very close to that city. The priest, who worked in that house of worship, came bringing bulls to be offered to Paul and Barnabas, because he heard that two of their gods had come down. He also brought floral wreaths to decorate the sacrifices.
\p
\v 14 But when Paul and Barnabas heard the priest's plan, they tore their robes as a sign that the two of them completely disapproved. Then they ran into the middle of the crowd, speaking in loud voices,
\v 15 “Friends, don't do this! We're only normal men— just like you. We came here to teach you the news of salvation so that you would stop worshiping false gods, but turn and worship the only true God— that is He who created the sky, the earth, the sea, and everything that is in those three places.
\v 16 In past times, God allowed everyone to do whatever they thought was right.
\v 17 But God gives you blessings to show that He really exists. For example, He gives you rain from the sky, plants that produce a lot, plenty of food, and joyful hearts.”
\v 18 Even though the two of them spoke like that, they almost didn't succeed in keeping the crowd from offering a sacrifice to honor the two of them. But in the end, the offering didn't happen.
\p
\v 19 Then some Jews from Antioch and Iconium came there. They changed the thinking of the crowd to side with them. Then the crowd threw stones at Paul and dragged him outside the city, because they thought he was dead.
\v 20 But when the people who had begun to follow Jesus stood around Paul, he stood up and went back into the city. Then he left for Derbe the next day, with Barnabas.
\s The two apostles return to Antioch in the province of Syria
\p
\v 21 In the city of Derbe, Paul and Barnabas told the news of salvation, and many people believed in Jesus. After that, they returned to Lystra, Iconium and the city of Antioch— which was in the province of Pisidia.
\v 22 The two of them encouraged the believers in those cities to keep holding on to their faith in Jesus. They said, “We have to go through much suffering before entering God's kingdom.”
\v 23 They also chose elders for every church. And after they all prayed and fasted, Paul and Barnabas surrendered those elders into the hands of the Jesus— the Lord in whom they believed.
\p
\v 24 And after that, the two of them traveled back through the province of Pisidia, and arrived in the province of Pamphylia.
\v 25 They taught the news of salvation once more in the city of Perga, and then went down to the city of Attalia.
\v 26 They took a ship from there across to the city of Antioch in the province of Syria— which is the place where the church earlier surrendered them to be guarded by God according to His kindness. That's how the two of them finished the task that had been entrusted to them.
\p
\v 27 When they arrived in Antioch, Paul and Barnabas gathered the church and told them everything that God had done for the two of them. They also said, “God has definitely opened the door of opportunity so that many non-Jewish people believe in Jesus.”
\v 28 Then they stayed with the brothers and sisters in the faith in that city for a long time.
