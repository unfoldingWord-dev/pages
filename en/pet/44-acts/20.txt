\s Paul goes to the provinces of Macedonia and Achaia
\p
\v 1 After the riot had stopped, Paul gathered all the followers of Jesus and encouraged them. Then he said goodbye and left for the province of Macedonia.
\v 2 He visited the churches there, and gave lots of advice to encourage them. Then he came to the province of Achaia— which is also called Greece.
\v 3 He stayed there for three months. But when he was getting ready to sail for Syria, he heard that the Jews were planning to kill him on that trip. For that reason, he decided to return through Macedonia.
\p
\v 4 The people who accompanied him on that trip were Timothy, Sopater (son of Pyrrhus, from the city of Berea), Aristarchus and Secundus (two people from the city of Thessalonica), Gaius (from Derbe), and Tychicus and Trophimus (both from the province of Asia).
\v 5 They left first, then Paul and I (Luke) followed afterwards and they waited for us in Troas.
\v 6 Then, after the Passover Day Celebration,\f + \fr 20:6 \fk Passover Day Celebration \ft Literally, the “Celebration of Unleavened Bread.” See the footnote in Acts 12:3.\f* we left by ship from Philippi, headed for Troas. After five days of travel, the two of us arrived in Troas and met them. We all stayed there for seven days.
\s Paul's last visit to the city of Troas
\p
\v 7 On Sunday night,\f + \fr 20:7 \fk Sunday night \ft Literally, “The first day of that week.” For the Jews, the first day of every week began after the sun set on Saturday, but if Luke was using Greek time in this verse, then Sunday night was intended.\f* we got together with the brothers and sisters in the faith in Troas to eat and celebrate the Holy Supper.\f + \fr 20:7 \fk Holy Supper \ft Literally, “break bread.” See the note in Acts 2:42.\f* Paul preached to them for a long time, until midnight, because our party was planning to leave them the next morning.
\v 8 We all gathered in an upstairs room, and many lamps were lit.
\v 9 A young man, whose name was Eutychus, was sitting in a window. While Paul continued to talk, Eutychus became sleepy and finally couldn't resist his drowsiness, then fell fast asleep and fell from the third floor. When the people went down and picked him up, it was obvious that he was dead.
\v 10 But Paul went down and immediately knelt by the young man and hugged him. Then Paul said, “Don't worry because he's still alive.”
\v 11 Then Paul and the rest of us went upstairs again, and he led us in the Holy Supper. Then he continued to talk to them until dawn. After that, he left with our group.
\v 12 Then Eutychus was taken to his home, and all the brothers and sisters in the faith there were very glad because he was still alive.
\s Paul's trip from Troas to the city of Miletus
\p
\v 13 According to the plans we had arranged, Paul walked on foot from Troas to the city of Assos, while I (Luke) sailed ahead with the other members of our group to Assos, and waited for him there.
\v 14 So when Paul arrived in Assos, he also got on the ship which we were on, and we continued the trip to the city of Mitylene.
\v 15 The next day we sailed from Mitylene until we saw the island of Chios. We continued sailing, and on the following day we passed by the island of Samos. Then we arrived in Miletus the next day.
\v 16 In that way, we passed by Ephesus. Paul had decided not to stop there of course, so that he wouldn't stay too long in the province of Asia, because he wanted to take part in the holiday of Pentecost in Jerusalem, if possible.
\s Paul speaks to the elders of the church at Ephesus for the last time
\p
\v 17 For that reason, Paul sent news to Ephesus and asked the elders of the church there to come and meet him in Miletus.
\v 18 After they arrived, he said to them, “You know how I lived among you, from the first day I arrived in Asia until now.
\v 19 I always served the Lord with humility, and often cried because I really love you. I also have experienced many difficulties because of the evil plans of the Jews against me.
\v 20 Even so, I never held back any teaching that was useful for you— either when I taught in public or from house to house.
\v 21 I always taught clearly— both to Jewish and non-Jewish people, that they should repent and believe in our Lord Jesus.
\p
\v 22 But now I'm obligated to obey God's Spirit, who orders me to go to Jerusalem. And I don't know what will happen to me there.
\v 23 But in every city which I've just recently visited, the Holy Spirit has told me that I'll be put in jail and experience suffering later on.
\v 24 But for me, living or dying isn't important. I only think about fighting to the finish line, and completing the task which the Lord Jesus entrusted to me— which is to tell the Good News about God's kindness.
\p
\v 25 “And now I know that all of you, whom I've served and taught for so long about God's kingdom, will never see me again.
\v 26 So today I'm emphasizing to you that if any of you go to hell, the Lord won't blame me!
\v 27 For I faithfully told you all the teachings that God wants you to know.
\p
\v 28 So I urge each of you to guard yourselves, and shepherd all of the churches well, because the Holy Spirit has appointed you as guardians and shepherds of God's church— the flock of His sheep which He has been redeemed by the blood of His Son.
\v 29 I know that as soon as I go, evil wolves will sneak in among you, and they'll try to destroy this flock of sheep.
\v 30 In fact, some men will rise up among you who'll try to twist the true teachings, in order to draw brothers and sisters in the faith away to become their followers.
\v 31 For that reason, be on guard! Remember that for three years, I never stopped advising each of you day and night, with many tears.
\p
\v 32 “And now I surrender you to God, according to His promise to us in the news of salvation about His kindness. It is that Good News which has power to strengthen you to receive all the blessings which God has prepared for His people whom He made pure.
\v 33 I never wanted your wealth— whether in the form of silver, gold, or clothing.
\v 34 You yourselves know that I worked with both my hands so that I could meet all my needs and the needs of some of the brothers in the faith who worked with me.
\v 35 In that way, I always tried to be an example to you of how we should work hard to help the people who're weak. And we should also remember that the Lord Jesus said, ‘God blesses those who give help more than those who receive help.’”
\p
\v 36 After Paul said all of that, he knelt down with all of them and led them in prayer.
\v 37 Then they all cried while hugging and kissing him over and over again.
\v 38 They were very sad, especially because Paul said that they wouldn't see him again. Then they took him to the ship.
