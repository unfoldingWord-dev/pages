\s The coming of the Holy Spirit
\p
\v 1 When the Day of Pentecost came, everyone who had followed Jesus in the past had gathered together in one house.
\v 2 Then a sound like a strong wind was suddenly heard from the sky. The sound filled the whole house where they were gathered.
\v 3 Then they saw something that looked like flames of fire, which spread and stopped over each of them.
\v 4 They were all filled by the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other languages, according to the ability that was given to them by the Spirit.
\p
\v 5 It happened that there were people of the Jewish religion at that time in Jerusalem, who came from almost all over the whole world. They were people who sincerely worshiped God, who had come to celebrate Pentecost.\f + \fr 2:5 \fk celebrate Pentecost \ft was a Jewish holiday to give thanks for the wheat harvest. This celebration took place fifty days after Passover.\f*
\v 6 When they heard that loud noise, many of them came and gathered at that house. They were very confused because they heard those followers of Jesus speaking in various languages, so each one could hear the news in his own language.
\v 7-8 Then they were truly amazed and said, “How could this possibly happen?! These people who are speaking are all Galileans,\f + \fr 2:7-8 \fk Galileans \ft The people assumed that Galileans could only speak the everyday Hebrew language used in Galilee, and the trade language— which was the Greek language.\f* but each of us hears them speaking in our own languages! That's really amazing because we come from many regions,
\v 9 including Parthia, Media, Elam, and residents of Mesopotamia, Judea, Cappadocia, Pontus, and the province of Asia.
\v 10 That also includes the regions of Phrygia, Pamphylia, Egypt, and parts of Libya that are near the city of Cyrene. There are also those who come from the capital city of Rome,
\v 11 from the island of Crete, and Arabians. We who are gathered are Jews, and also people from other ethnic groups who've become followers of the Jewish religion. It's truly amazing that we can hear them speak in our own languages about the amazing things which God has done.”
\v 12 Because they were amazed and confused, they asked each other, “How could this happen?”
\v 13 But there were some others too, who laughed at the followers of Jesus because they thought, “Those people are just drunk.”
\s Peter preaches to the crowd
\p
\v 14 Then Peter stood with the eleven apostles, and said to the crowd with a loud voice, “Jewish brothers and sisters, and everyone who's living in Jerusalem, allow me to tell you the meaning of all that's happening. Listen carefully.
\v 15 We aren't drunk, as you suppose, because it's just nine o'clock in the morning.
\v 16 But what you're witnessing is what was prophesied in the past by the prophet Joel, when he said,
\q1
\v 17 ‘God says, “In the last days,
\q2 I will pour out My Spirit on everyone,
\q2 and your sons and daughters will prophesy,
\q2 your young people will have visions,
\q2 and many of your old men will have special dreams.
\q1
\v 18 In those last days too,
\q2 I will even pour out My Spirit on those who've been sold to masters as slaves—
\q2 both male and female slaves.
\q2 Even they also included in My chosen people, and in those days even they will prophesy.
\q1
\v 19 And at that time, I will also do many miracles
\q2 in the sky and on the earth,
\q2 in the form of blood, or fire, and clouds of smoke.
\q1
\v 20 The sun will change to become dark,
\q2 and the moon will become red like blood.
\q2 After that, the great and amazing day of the Lord will come.
\q1
\v 21 And everyone who calls out to the Lord asking for His help will be saved.”’\x + Joel 2:28-32\x*
\p
\v 22 So my Jewish brothers and sisters, listen to what I'm saying: It's now been proven that Jesus, from the village of Nazareth, was sent by God. And God has already proven that to you by doing all kinds of miracles through Jesus, as you already know.
\v 23 According to God's plan which He determined in the past, Jesus was handed over to you. And with the help of people who don't know God, you killed Jesus by nailing Him to a cross.
\v 24 But now God has raised Him from the dead, and freed Him from continuous suffering in the kingdom of death. For the kingdom of death couldn't possibly hold on to Him.
\v 25 For King David already prophesied about Jesus like this:
\q1 ‘I realize that the Lord is always with Me.\f + \fr 2:25 \fk Me \ft In verses 25-28, capital letters are used according to Peter's intent— which is that in Ps.16, David wrote God's Son's word to God. So it isn't David who was speaking to God.\f*
\q2 I will be protected by Him from the attacks of all who fight against Me, because He is close to Me.\f + \fr 2:25 \fk close to Me \ft Literally, “at My right side.” These words were chosen so that this verse doesn't seem to conflict with verses that say that Jesus is at God's right side.\f*
\q1
\v 26 For that reason, My heart rejoices,
\q2 and I always praise You gladly with My mouth.
\q2 My body even feels calm because of the hope that You've given Me.
\q1
\v 27 For You won't leave My spirit
\q2 in the place of dead people.
\q1 And You won't let the body of Your Holy One
\q2 rot in the grave either.
\q1
\v 28 You've shown Me the way leading to life.
\q2 And I will always rejoice, because I will live with You.’\x + Ps. 16:8-11\x*
\p
\v 29 Brothers and sisters, allow me to speak clearly to you about David, our forefather. What He said was definitely not about himself, because he died and was buried, and his grave is still with us to this day.
\v 30 But David was also a prophet, and he knew that God had promised with an oath that One of David's own descendants would become king and sit on David's throne.
\v 31 So David already knew what would happen, and that is why he spoke like that about the resurrection of his Descendant— namely the Christ, because he said that the Holy One ‘won't be left in the place of dead people’ and that ‘His body won't rot in the grave.’
\p
\v 32 So, this Jesus is the one whom God has raised from the dead! And all of us in this group saw Him after He came back to life, and now we've been sent to be witnesses of that.
\v 33 So now He has been taken up to heaven, and sits in the most honored place— which is at God's right side. And Jesus has also received the Holy Spirit, who was promised by His Father. So now Jesus has poured out the Spirit, and that's what you're seeing and hearing now.
\v 34 For it wasn't David who was taken up to heaven, but he himself said,
\q1 ‘God said to my Lord:
\q1 “Sit at My right side and rule as King
\q2
\v 35 until I defeat all who oppose You, and make them Your slaves.”’\x + Ps. 110:1; Matt. 22:44; 1Cor. 15:25; Heb. 1:13\x*
\p
\v 36 For that reason, let all the people of Israel know for certain that God has appointed Jesus— whom you crucified, as Lord and the Christ\f + \fr 2:36 \fk Christ \ft is a word from the Greek language, which means ‘anointed one’. In the Hebrew language, the same term is called ‘Messiah’. That term denotes a position, like ‘district head’ or ‘governor’. In the time of the Old Testament, each king was anointed with olive oil by a prophet, as a sign of being chosen and confirmed by God. And every priest or prophet of that time was also anointed. It's appropriate to call Jesus the ‘Anointed One’, because He holds the position of prophet, High King, and our High Priest (Heb. 4-10). Because of prophecies in the books of the prophets and in the Psalms, at the time of Jesus, the Jewish people in general understood the meaning of ‘Christ’ as the King of Salvation whom God promised, who would come from the descendants of King David, and who would free the nation of Israel from the nations who were their enemies, set up a government with the power of God, and rule with justice. (Is. 9:5-6 [Indonesian verse numbering]; Gen. 3:15; Deut. 18:18-19; Mic. 5:2; Zech. 12:10-14; Mal. 3:1, 4:5-6; Ps. 2, 16, 22, 40, 110.\f* who was promised.”
\p
\v 37 When Peter finished speaking, the hearts of the crowd who heard him were touched. Then they asked Peter and the other apostles, “Brothers, what should we do?”
\p
\v 38 Peter answered, “Each of you should repent and be baptized as followers of Christ Jesus. In doing that, your sins are forgiven, and you'll receive the Holy Spirit.
\v 39 For this promise is valid for you, your children— even for those who are in distant places, that is everyone who's called by our Lord God.”
\p
\v 40 And Peter spoke and testified about many other things to encourage their hearts. At the end he said, “Do all you can to escape from God's judgment on the evil of people of this age!”
\v 41 Then those who believed Peter's teaching were baptized, and on that day the number of believers grew by about three thousand people.
\v 42 They diligently studied the apostles' teaching, and also often gathered in fellowship, prayed together and ate together (including the Holy Supper).\f + \fr 2:42 \fk the Holy Supper \ft Literally, “broke bread.” In the age of the apostles those words were used to include eating together with celebrating what is now called the ‘Holy Supper’, which is the meal that Jesus commanded His followers to do to remember Him (Luke 22:14-20).\f*
\s The believers share their possessions with each other
\p
\v 43 At that time, everyone in Jerusalem felt amazed and afraid because God gave power to the apostles to do many miracles.
\v 44 All of the believers kept united, and felt their possessions were common property.
\v 45 So it often happened that one of them sold the land he owned and shared the proceeds of the sale with his fellow members who needed help.
\v 46 They got together everyday, with one heart and mind, in the courtyard of God's Temple. They often invited each other to eat together in their houses too (where they also celebrated the Holy Supper). They did this with great happiness and wholeheartedly.
\v 47 They kept praising God, and were liked by everyone. And the Lord added newly saved people to the group of believers everyday.
