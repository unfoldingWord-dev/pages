\s Stephen's defense
\p
\v 1 Then the high priest asked Stephen, “Is their report true?”
\v 2 Stephen answered, “Fathers and brothers, listen to me! The Most Glorious God showed Himself to our forefather Abraham. At that time, he still lived in Mesopotamia and hadn't yet moved to Haran.
\v 3 And God said,
\mi ‘Leave your land and your family too, and go to the land that I'll show you.’\x + Gen. 12:1\x*
\m
\v 4 Abraham left the land of the people of Babel\f + \fr 7:4 \fk Babel \ft Literally, “Chaldea”— a land in the southern part of Mesopotamia. See verse 2.\f* and moved to Haran. After his father died, God ordered Abraham to move from there to this land, the place where we live now.
\v 5 At that time, God didn't give Abraham even a piece of land to become his property. But God promised him, ‘This land will become the property of your descendants.’ However at that time, Abraham didn't yet have a son.
\v 6 God also said to him,
\mi ‘Your descendants will live as foreigners in the land of another people group, and that people group will force all of your descendants to work as their slaves, and will treat them very harshly for four hundred years.
\v 7 But I'll punish the people group that enslaves them. And after that, your descendants will come out of that land and will worship Me in this place.’\x + Ex. 15:13-14; 3:12\x*
\m
\v 8 Then God gave Abraham the promise of circumcision for all male children. So when Isaac was born, and was one week old,\f + \fr 7:8 \fk one week old \ft Literally, “eight days.” If a boy baby was born on a Monday, then he was circumcised on the following Monday. In the way the Jews counted, the first day and the last day were counted. So in the example above, the first Monday and the last Monday are counted, so the total is eight days.\f* Abraham circumcised him. It was the same when Isaac had a child— Jacob, he was also circumcised. Jacob also did the same thing to his twelve sons— who then became the twelve forefathers of our Jewish ethnic group.
\p
\v 9 “But the other sons of Jacob were jealous of their younger brother Joseph, so they sold him, and he was forced to work as a slave in the land of Egypt. But God was with Joseph,
\v 10 and rescued him from every trouble he experienced. And God made Joseph able to answer the king of Egypt\f + \fr 7:10 \fk king of Egypt \ft Literally, “pharaoh, king of Egypt.” The word “pharaoh” isn't his name, but a word that means 'king' in the Egyptian language.\f* wisely, so that the king gladly accepted him. Then the king raised up Joseph to become the governor of all Egypt— including the management of all of the king's own palace.
\v 11 Then a famine occurred in all of Egypt and Canaan, so that all of the people really suffered. And our forefathers in the land of Canaan couldn't find food either.
\p
\v 12 “When Jacob heard that there was food in Egypt, he sent our forefathers there. That was the first time they went to Egypt.
\v 13 But when their food was gone, they went back a second time. Then Joseph openly made himself known to his older brothers. That was when the king learned about Joseph's family.
\v 14 Then Joseph sent his older brothers back home to bring his father and all of his family, to move to Egypt. At that time they all numbered seventy-five people.
\v 15 Then Jacob and all his family left for Egypt and lived there. So Jacob died in that land, and all of our forefathers died there too.
\v 16 But their bodies were brought back to Shechem and buried in the tomb that was bought from the local people— namely Hamor's sons, by Abraham with a lot of money.
\p
\v 17 “After many years, and when God was ready to fulfill the promise he gave to Abraham in the past, the number of our people in Egypt had really increased.
\v 18 At that time, a new king ruled in Egypt, who didn't know about Joseph.
\v 19 That king cheated and mistreated our forefathers. He forced them to throw out their babies so that they died.
\v 20 That's when Moses was born, and he was a child who was pleasing in God's eyes. His parents hid him in their house for three months.
\v 21 When they couldn't hide him any longer, they had to throw him out. Then the King of Egypt's daughter took him and raised him as her own child.
\v 22 So Moses was educated in all the knowledge of the Egyptians until he became powerful— both in speech and in action.
\p
\v 23 “After Moses was forty years old, he decided to visit his brothers and sisters, the people of Israel.
\v 24 That's when he saw one of them being persecuted by an Egyptian, so he tried to defend the Israelite. Then he beat the Egyptian to death.
\v 25 Moses thought that his Israelite brothers and sisters would understand that God was using him to save them. But they didn't understand that.
\v 26 The next day, he met two Jews who were fighting. He tried to reconcile them by saying, ‘Hey friends, you're brothers. So why're you fighting?’
\v 27 But the man who was doing wrong to the other pushed Moses and said,
\mi ‘Who appointed you to become a ruler and judge over us?
\v 28 Do you want to kill me too, like you killed that Egyptian yesterday?’\x + Ex. 2:14\x*
\m
\v 29 When Moses heard what the man said, he was frightened because the news about the murder of the Egyptian had obviously spread. For that reason, he ran away and lived as a foreigner in the land of the Midianites. He married there, and had two sons.
\p
\v 30 “After forty years had passed, an angel showed himself to Moses in the form of a bush that was burning, in the desert near Mount Sinai.
\v 31 Moses was very amazed to see that fire. When he approached the fire to see it more clearly, he heard the voice of the Lord saying,
\mi
\v 32 ‘I am the God of your forefathers, who is worshiped by Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.’\x + Ex. 3:6\x*
\m When Moses heard those words, he shook and was very afraid, and he didn't dare look at the fire again.
\v 33 Then the Lord said to him again,
\mi ‘Take off your sandals, because the place where you're standing is holy ground.
\v 34 I've seen that My people are severely persecuted in Egypt, of course, and I've heard their complaints. Because of that, I've come down to free them. So get ready, because I'm sending you to Egypt now.’\x + Ex. 3:5-10\x*
\p
\v 35 “So the Lord sent Moses, who hadn't been accepted by the Israelites in the past when they said, ‘Who appointed you to be a ruler and judge over us?’ But he was, in fact, the one sent by God through the angel who appeared to him in the middle of that bush, to become a ruler and savior.
\v 36 Then Moses led them out of Egypt, by doing many miracles in the land of Egypt, at the Red Sea, and also while they were in the desert for forty years.
\v 37 And this Moses is also the one who said to the people of Israel,
\mi ‘God will once again raise up a Prophet for you from the descendants of our own people. He'll also give God's message like I do.’\x + Deut. 18:15\x*
\m
\v 38 Moses continued to live with God's people— our forefathers, while they were in the desert. And the angel who had spoken to him in the past on Mount Sinai repeatedly gave God's Words to him and to our forefathers. And finally, that Word has been given to us— which is the word that gives life.
\p
\v 39 “But our forefathers didn't want to obey him. Instead, they rejected him. And in their hearts, they wanted to return to Egypt.
\v 40 Then they said to Aaron,
\mi ‘Make us some idol statues as gods that will lead us back to Egypt, because we don't know what's happened to Moses, who brought us out of that land.’\x + Ex. 32:1\x*
\m
\v 41 Then they made a statue in the form of a calf, and brought offerings to the idol. And they had a big party to celebrate with joyful hearts, the statue made with their own hands.
\v 42 Because of those deeds of theirs, God turned away from them and let them worship the sun, moon, and stars. As it's written in the book of the prophets, God said,
\q1 ‘You Israelites didn't truly bring sacrifices and offerings to Me
\q2 when you lived in the desert for forty years.
\q1
\v 43 For in your hearts, until now,
\q2 you still prefer to worship in the tent of your god Molech,
\q2 and worship the idol statues that you made in the form of the god Rephan, the star god.
\q1 Because of that, I've decided that you'll become prisoners of war,
\q2 and be taken away by your enemies beyond the city of Babylon.’\x + Amos 5:25-27\x*
\p
\v 44 “Our forefathers took the Holy Tabernacle\f + \fr 7:44 \fk Holy Tabernacle \ft Literally, “Tent of Witness.” That name was given to the Holy Tabernacle because the Ark of the Covenant was kept inside the tent. The Ark of the Covenant reminded the people of Israel of God's presence with them, and reminded them to live according to that promise with God too.\f* with them wherever they moved while in the desert. That Tabernacle was made according to God's instructions, like what God commanded and showed to Moses.
\v 45 After that, Joshua led our forefathers to take over this region. They could stay in this region because God drove the people out of here who didn't know Him. And they brought the Holy Tabernacle here, and that tent was with them until the time David became king.
\v 46 David was truly pleasing to God, so he asked God's permission to build a house for Him who is the God worshiped by Jacob.
\v 47 However it was his son, Solomon, who built God's Temple.
\p
\v 48-49 “Yet the Most High God doesn't live in a house that's built by human hands, like what the Lord said that was told by one of the prophets:
\q1 49 ‘The sky is the place where I sit to rule,
\q2 and earth is the place I put my feet.
\q1 So it's impossible for you to build a house for Me
\q2 or a place for Me to rest.
\q1
\v 50 Remember, My hands were the ones that made all of this!’”\x + Is. 66:1-2\x*
\p
\v 51 Then Stephen said, “You're hard-headed people! And in your hearts, you're just the same as the tribes who don't know God! And your ears don't want to hear Him! You're just like our forefathers: You always oppose the Holy Spirit too!
\v 52 Try to name one prophet who wasn't persecuted by our forefathers! There aren't any, of course! In fact, they killed the prophets who in times past told about the coming of the Christ— who was God's Servant, who always lived right in God's sight. But now you're the ones who betrayed and killed Him!
\v 53 You, of course, received the Law which was given by God through His angel, but you've never obeyed that law!”
\s Stephen is killed
\p
\v 54 When the Jewish leaders heard all of that, they were extremely offended and could hardly restrain themselves any more.\f + \fr 7:54 \fk could hardly restrain themselves any more \ft Literally, “gnashed their teeth at him.”\f*
\v 55 But at that moment, Stephen was filled by the Holy Spirit. And when he looked up to heaven, he saw God's glory. And Jesus was standing at the most honored place— which is at God's right side.
\v 56 Then he said, “Look! I see heaven open and Jesus, as the Son of Man,\f + \fr 7:56 \fk Son of Man \ft When Jesus lived on earth, He often called Himself the “Son of Man.” But the meaning of this term isn't directed at the word 'son'. In the Hebrew language, 'son of man' means 'normal human being'. Jesus called Himself this to remind his listeners about what the Prophet Daniel witnessed in a vision of the King of Salvation. (Dan. 7:13-14) For Daniel saw Him in heaven in the form of a 'son of man'— meaning in the form of a 'normal human being', when God appointed Him King over everything.\f* is standing in the most honored place there.”
\p
\v 57 When they heard Stephen's words, they cried out while covering their ears, then they all attacked him.
\v 58 They dragged him outside the city, and threw stones at him until he died. The people who testified against Stephen left their robes at the feet of a young man named Saul.\f + \fr 7:58 \fk The people who testified … \ft The people refered to are normally understood as those mentioned in Acts 6:11-14, however this can also be understood to include everyone who heard Stephen's words in verse 56. (Compare with Mark 14:63-64.) According to the Law, the people who brought testimony about someone's serious offense must be the first to throw stones at the guilty person.\f*
\v 59 While the people were throwing stones at him, Stephen prayed, “Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.”
\v 60 Then while kneeling, he cried out in a loud voice, “Lord, don't hold this sin against them1” After saying that, Stephen died.
