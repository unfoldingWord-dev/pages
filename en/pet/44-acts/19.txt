\c 19
\s When Paul was in Ephesus
\p
\v 1 While Apollos was still in the city of Corinth, in the province of Achaia, Paul visited several regions in the provinces of Galatia and Phrygia. Then he kept traveling through the interior of the province of Asia, and arrived once again in Ephesus. He met some believers there.
\v 2 So he asked them, “When you believed in Jesus, did you also receive the Holy Spirit?”
\p They answered, “Not yet— in fact we haven't even heard that there's a Holy Spirit.”
\p
\v 3 Then he asked again, “If that's so, whose teaching about baptism are you following?”
\p They said, “What was taught by John.”
\p
\v 4 Then Paul said, “John baptized people as a sign that they had repented from their sins. And at that time he also told them that they must believe in the One who would come after him— namely Jesus.”
\p
\v 5 When they heard Paul say that, they asked him to baptize them in the name of the Lord Jesus.
\v 6 And when Paul laid his hands on each of them, God's Spirit came down on them. And they began to speak in various languages of the Spirit, and prophesied.
\v 7 There were about twelve men in all.
\p
\v 8 For the next three months while Paul stayed in Ephesus, he often entered the Jewish synagogue. He boldly debated and convinced them about the news of salvation and God's kingdom.
\v 9 But some of them hardened their hearts and refused to believe in Jesus. And they insulted the way of salvation through Jesus in public. Because of that, Paul left the synagogue, and he urged the other believers to separate themselves from the people who didn't believe in Jesus. After that, he taught those believers every day in the meeting hall which was called the Discussion Hall of Tyrannus.\f + \fr 19:9 \fk Discussion Hall of Tyrannus \ft Tyrannus is the name of a person, and it isn't known now if he was the one who owned the hall or usually taught there. The root word for the name Tyrannus means “authority.”\f*
\v 10 And for two more years Paul continued to teach in that place, so that all the people who lived in the province of Asia— both Jews and non-Jews, heard the news of salvation about the Lord Jesus.
\s Seven sons of Sceva imitate Paul
\p
\v 11 At that time, God did many unusual miracles through Paul.
\v 12 If sick people couldn't come to meet Paul, then people brought handkerchiefs or cloths that were touched by Paul and laid them on the sick people, so they were healed. And there were also those who placed them on people who were possessed, then the evil spirits left them.
\p
\v 13 But there were some Jewish shamans who traveled from city to city. They tried to drive out evil spirits by using the name of the Lord Jesus. And several times they tried telling people who were possessed by evil spirits, “In the name of Jesus who's taught by Paul, we command you to come out of this person.”
\v 14 Seven sons of a man named Sceva did that. (That Sceva was the descendant of a Jewish priest, and he claimed he was the high priest.)
\p
\v 15 But once when they tried to do that again, the evil spirit answered them through the mouth of the person who was possessed, “I know who Jesus is, and I've heard about Paul, but who're you?!”
\v 16 Then the person who was possessed by the evil spirit jumped up and attacked them. He overcame them and tore off their clothes, so that they were wounded, and ran naked from that house.
\p
\v 17 When all the people who lived in Ephesus— both Jews and non-Jews, heard what happened, they became very afraid and truly honored the Lord Jesus.
\v 18 Then many people who had believed in Jesus came and confessed in public that they had been involved in sorcery.
\v 19 In fact, many of them gathered their sorcery books and burned them in front of everyone. The total value of those books was about 50,000 silver coins, if counted with money.
\v 20 In that way, the news of salvation about the Lord Jesus spread more and more and increased in its effect.
\s Paul plans a trip
\p
\v 21 After all of that happened, Paul planned to go to Jerusalem by passing through Macedonia and Achaia. And he also said, “After I go there, I must visit Rome.”
\v 22 Then Paul sent two of his representatives— namely Timothy and Erastus, to go ahead of him to the province of Macedonia. Meanwhile, he himself stayed a while longer in the province of Asia.
\s The riot in Ephesus
\p
\v 23 At about that time, a great riot took place because people opposed the way of salvation which was taught by Paul.
\v 24 The problem began with a businessman named Demetrius. He had a business of making artistic objects from silver. There was a temple for the goddess Artemis in that city, and Demetrius made small temples in the shape of the temple of that goddess, along with his coworkers. Those small temples were sold to worshipers of the goddess, so everyone who was involved in that business made a lot of money.
\v 25 Demetrius gathered all the craftsmen who were involved in that work and said to them, “Brothers, you all know that we make a lot of money because of this work.”
\v 26 But now you yourselves see and hear that Paul has changed the thinking of many people by saying, ‘The gods and goddesses made by human hands don't live and don't have power over anything at all.’ And he has succeeded in changing the thinking of many people— including residents of Ephesus as well as residents of all of the regions in Asia.
\v 27 So the misfortune isn't just that our work will be considered useless, but the main center for the worship of our goddess will later be considered useless too, and the greatness of the name of Artemis herself will be trampled upon! How unfortunate! For she's the goddess who's worshiped by everyone in Asia and in the whole world.”
\p
\v 28 When they heard him speak like that, their hearts were inflamed, and they shouted, “Great is Artemis, the goddess of the Ephesians!”
\v 29 Then the whole city became chaotic. And two of Paul's followers from Macedonia, Gaius and Aristarchus, were captured and dragged along when the crowd ran wildly into the stadium.
\v 30 At that moment, Paul also wanted to enter the stadium to speak to the crowd, but the brothers and sisters in the faith wouldn't allow him.
\v 31 Even some high officials of the province of Asia who had become close friends of Paul sent word that he should not enter that place.
\p
\v 32 The situation in the stadium was very chaotic, because there were people shouting about one issue, and there were others shouting about something else. So most of the people didn't know why they had gathered there.
\v 33 Then some Jews pushed a man named Alexander to the front, because they wanted him to explain that those who caused this problem were not the Jews. Because Alexander wanted to speak, he signaled with his hand so that they would be quiet.
\v 34 But when the crowd realized that he was a Jew, they shouted for about two hours, “Great is Artemis, the goddess of the Ephesians!”
\p
\v 35 Then the city secretary commanded the crowd to be calm. After that he said, “Hey you people of Ephesus, there's no need for a commotion! Doesn't everyone in the world know that we Ephesians are the ones who guard the main temple of our great goddess Artemis! And we're the ones who guard her statue that fell down from the sky.\f + \fr 19:35 \fk statue … from the sky \ft Probably a rock or meteorite that the people thought looked like Artemis, the idol, which they worshiped.\f*
\v 36 And no one will deny that, of course. Because of that we should be calm. Don't rush to take action.
\v 37 You brought these two men here for nothing, because they haven't stolen anything from the temple of our goddess, and they haven't insulted her either.
\v 38 So if Demetrius and his coworkers are angry with someone, they can take that matter to the council of law— where the two parties can each point out their accusations before the judges in an orderly way.
\v 39 And if you still have other issues, we can settle those later in an official council of citizens,
\v 40 because our authorities in the Roman government could accuse us of this disturbance today. If they ask, ‘Why did you cause that riot?’— we couldn't give a reason.”
\v 41 After he said that, he ordered them to disperse. And they all dispersed.Unfinished
