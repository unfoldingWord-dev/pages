\s Peter and Cornelius
\p
\v 1 There was a Roman soldier named Cornelius in the city of Caesarea. He led a group of a hundred soldiers called the Italian Troops.
\v 2 Cornelius and his family truly honored and obeyed God, and he often gave help to poor people, and always prayed to God too.
\v 3 One day, about three o'clock in the afternoon, he had a vision and saw clearly that an angel came to him and said, “Cornelius!”
\p
\v 4 Then Cornelius looked at the angel fearfully and asked, “What is it, Sir?”
\p The angel answered, “God is pleased with your prayers and with all of your helping of poor people. And in God's sight, those two things are like an offering.
\v 5 Now send some men to Joppa to get a man named Simon— who is also called Peter.
\v 6 He's staying as a guest in the house of a man who prepares animal skins. His name is also Simon, and his house is on the seashore.”
\v 7 Then after the angel left, Cornelius called two of his servants and one of the soldiers who served as his personal secretary. The soldier was also a worshiper of God.
\v 8 And after he explained everything to the three of them, he sent them to Joppa.
\p
\v 9 The next day at about twelve noon, while they were on their way and nearing the city of Joppa, Peter went up on the terrace on top of the house,\f + \fr 10:9 \fk top of the house \ft In the land of Israel, the upper part of houses are usually flat and used like a terrace or yard in Indonesia.\f* to pray.
\v 10 Then he felt hungry and wanted to eat. While someone was preparing the food, Peter had a vision.
\v 11 He saw the sky open up, then something that looked like a wide linen sheet came down from the sky. The sheet hung by its four corners.
\v 12 There were many different kinds of animals in that sheet which couldn't be eaten by Jews, including four-legged animals, animals that crawl on the ground, and wild birds.
\v 13 Then a voice said to him, “Peter, stand up! Kill something and eat it.”
\p
\v 14 But Peter said, “No, Lord! I've never eaten anything that's forbidden or unclean.”
\p
\v 15 The voice spoke for a second time, “What God says is permissable you must not consider forbidden.”
\v 16 That vision appeared three times, then the sheet was immediately lifted up again to the sky.
\p
\v 17 While Peter was still thinking about the meaning of that vision, the people who were sent by Cornelius had found Simon's house and were standing at the gate of the yard of that house.
\v 18 They asked, “Is there a man named Simon— who is also called Peter, staying here?”
\p
\v 19 And while Peter was still thinking about that vision, the Holy Spirit said to him, “Listen, Peter! There are three men looking for you.
\v 20 Get up and go downstairs. Go with them without doubting, because I've sent them to you.”
\p
\v 21 Peter went down and said to the three men, “I'm the one you're looking for. Why did you come?”
\p
\v 22 They said, “Cornelius— a Roman officer, ordered us to come here. He's a good man. He has become a worshiper of God, and all the Jews respect him. He was told by an angel from heaven to invite you, Sir, to come to his house, so that he can hear teaching that you will give.”
\v 23 Then Peter invited them to come in and stay overnight in that house. The next day, after getting ready, he left with them. Several brothers in the faith from Joppa also went with them.
\v 24 And the next day they arrived in Caesarea. Cornelius was already waiting for them, and had gathered all of his family and close friends in his house.
\p
\v 25 When Peter arrived at his house, Cornelius immediately knelt at Peter's feet and worshiped him.
\v 26 But Peter held him and pulled him up to standing, saying, “Stand up! I'm just a human being— just like you!”
\v 27 While talking with Cornelius, they went into the house,and Peter saw many people who had gathered there.
\p
\v 28 And Peter said to them, “You already know that we Jews are forbidden to associate with or visit with non-Jewish people like you. But God has shown me that I shouldn't consider anyone at all too unclean to be accepted by God.
\v 29 For that reason, I didn't have a problem when I was invited to come here. So now I want to ask: Why did you call me?”
\p
\v 30 And Cornelius answered, “Four days ago, I was praying in this house, at the same time as it is now— that is at three o'clock in the afternoon. Suddenly a man stood before me in shining clothes.
\v 31 Then he said, “Cornelius, God is pleased with your prayers and the help you often give to poor people.
\v 32 Because of that, send some people to Joppa to invite Simon— who is also called Peter, to come here. He is staying in the house of Simon, a man who prepares animal skins. His house is by the seashore.’
\v 33 So I quickly sent some men to go and call you, Sir. I'm thankful that you've come here, Sir. So now we've gathered before God to hear everything that the Lord has ordered you to tell us.”
\s Peter speaks in Cornelius' house
\p
\v 34 Then Peter said, “Now I truly realize that God doesn't discriminate between people.
\v 35 But from any people group whatsoever, people who honor Him and do what is right are received by Him.
\v 36 You've heard that God has given the Good News to the Jewish people, that we must make peace again with God through the Christ who was promised— that is Jesus, who's Lord over everyone in this world.
\v 37-38 And you already know about what Jesus, the Nazarene, did in all Judea. He began His ministry in the province of Galilee after John the Baptist had told the Jewish people that they must repent and be baptized. So you already know about Jesus, who was anointed by God with the Holy Spirit, and with His power. Then Jesus went everywhere and did good thing, and freed everyone who was controlled by the devil, because God was with Him.
\v 39 And we're eyewitnesses of everything that Jesus did in the province of Judea and in Jerusalem. But He was killed by the Jews by hanging Him on a cross.
\v 40 But on the third day, God brought Him back to life from death, and showed Him to us and to the crowd.
\v 41 Not all of the inhabitants of Jerusalem saw Him, but only the people chosen by God saw Him. We who ate and drank with Him after His resurrection from death were chosen by Him to be witnesses for Him.
\v 42 And He commanded us to tell everyone and witness that God has appointed Him to judge everyone— both those who are still living and those who have already died.
\v 43 All of the prophets have told news about Him, that through the name of Jesus, the sins of everyone who believes in Him will be forgiven.”
\s The Holy Spirit is given to people who aren't Jews
\p
\v 44 While Peter was still speaking like that, the Holy Spirit came down and controlled everyone who heard that news.
\v 45 The believers of the Jewish people who had come with Peter were really amazed to see that the Holy Spirit had been poured out on non-Jewish people too,
\v 46 for they heard those people praising God using various languages of the Spirit. Then Peter said to the Jewish brothers,
\v 47 “It's obvious that they've received the Holy Spirit, just like we experienced in the past. So people can't blame us if we baptize them with water too.”
\v 48 So Peter told the brothers in the faith from Joppa to baptize those non-Jewish people in the name of Christ Jesus. After that, Cornelius and the others asked Peter to stay with them for several more days.
