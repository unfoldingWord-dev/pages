\s Ananias and Sapphira agree to deceive the apostles
\p
\v 1 But there was a man named Ananias. He and his wife, Sapphira, sold a piece of land they owned.
\v 2 Then the couple agreed to keep some of the money from that land. So Ananias handed over only some of the money to the apostles.
\v 3 But Peter said, “Ananias, why have you let the devil control your heart? You've tried to deceive the Holy Spirit by keeping some of the money for your land.
\v 4 Before you sold it, the land was your property, of course. And after you sold it, the money from that land was still yours. Why did you plan this evil thing in your heart! You not only tried to deceive us, but to deceive God too!”
\v 5-6 When Ananias heard Peter's words, his breathing stopped, and he fell down. Some young men came and wrapped his body with a cloth, and then carried the body outside of the city and buried it. Everyone who heard about what happened became very frightened.
\p
\v 7 Then about three hours later, Ananias' wife came in. She didn't know what had happened to her husband.
\v 8 Then, while showing her the money which Ananias had turned over, Peter said to Sapphira, “Tell me, is it true that you sold your land for this price?”
\p And Sapphira answered, “Yes, the total was that much, of course.”
\p
\v 9 Then Peter said to her, “Why did the two of you agree to test the Lord's Spirit? Look! Those who buried your husband's body are at the door. And they'll carry your body out too!”
\v 10 At that very moment, Sapphira's breathing stopped, and she fell down near Peter's feet. When the young men entered, they found she was already dead. So they carried her body to the same place too, and buried her next to her husband.
\v 11 The whole church, and everyone who heard about it, became very frightened.
\s Many miracles from God
\p
\v 12 After that, the miracles done among the crowd by the apostles increased. At that time, all the believers met regularly in the courtyard of God's Temple which was called Solomon's Porch.\f + \fr 5:12 \fk Solomon's Porch \ft See the note in Acts 3:11.\f*
\v 13 Other people who didn't yet believe didn't dare to join them, but everyone respected them.
\v 14 And the people who believed in the Lord increased in number more and more— both men and women.
\v 15 In fact, the crowd brought sick people to the streets and laid them on beds or mats. They did that with the hope that sick people would be healed, if they were just touched by Peter's shadow when he passed by there.
\v 16 And many, many people came bringing sick people and those who were troubled by evil spirits from the cities around Jerusalem too. Then all of them were healed.
\s The Jewish leaders try to stop the apostles
\p
\v 17 Then the high priest and his friends began to take action against the apostles, because they were jealous. (All the friends of the high priest were part of the Sadducee religious group.)\f + \fr 5:12 \fk Sadducee religious group \ft See the note in Acts 4:1.\f*
\v 18 So they arrested the apostles and put them in prison.
\v 19 But at night, an angel came and opened the doors of the prison and led them out. He said,
\v 20 “Go and stand in one of the courtyards of God's Temple and tell the people there about the teaching of new life.”
\v 21 So they entered one of the courtyards of God's Temple very early in the morning, and began to teach the crowd, just like the angel told them to do.
\p At the same time, the high priest and his friends came through a different courtyard door, and they gathered the members of the Religious Court council and all of the Jewish elders to hold a council. Then they ordered some officials to bring the apostles from prison.
\v 22 But when the officials arrived at the prison, they didn't find the apostles there. They returned and reported the situation, saying,
\v 23 “We found the jail doors tightly locked, and every guard standing before each door. But when we opened all the doors, no one was inside.”
\v 24 When the head guard of God's Temple and everyone present heard that, they were confused, and tried to figure out what would happen after that.
\p
\v 25 Then a person came in and said, “Listen! Those men you put in jail yesterday are now standing in the courtyard of God's Temple and teaching the crowd.”
\v 26 Then the head guard of God's Temple, along with his officials, went and brought the apostles back. But they didn't use force, because they were afraid of the crowd who were following the apostles' teaching. They didn't want the crowd to become angry and stone them.
\p
\v 27 They brought the apostles in to face the Religious Court council. Then the high priest said to the apostles,
\v 28 “We strictly commanded you so that you wouldn't teach about that man from Nazareth again, but you've taken your teaching all over Jerusalem, and you also want to blame us for his death.”
\p
\v 29 But Peter and the other apostles answered, “We must obey God more than you.
\v 30 You killed Jesus by hanging Him on a cross, but the God of our forefathers has caused Him to live after death.
\v 31 Then God placed Him at the most honored place in heaven— which is at His right side. Jesus rules there as King and Savior. God did that so that all Jews would have an opportunity to repent, and be forgiven of their sins.
\v 32 We've been sent to testify about all of that. And the Holy Spirit— whom God has given to all of us who obey Him, is proving that those things are true too.”
\p
\v 33 When the Jewish leaders heard that, they became very angry and wanted to kill the apostles.
\v 34 But a Pharisee, whose name was Gamaliel, stood up among the members of the Religious Court council. He was a teacher of the Law who was respected by everyone. He ordered the apostles to be taken outside for a short while.
\v 35 Then he said to them, “Men of Israel, we need to be careful about what we do to them.
\v 36 Because in the past, a man named Theudas appeared. He claimed to be a leader, and there were four hundred people who became his followers. But when he was killed, all of his followers scattered, and his movement just evaporated.
\v 37 After that, at the time of the census of residents, another man named Judas appeared, a Galilean. Many people were interested and followed him. But he was killed too, and all of his followers scattered.
\v 38 So in this problem now, I suggest that we distance ourselves and leave them alone. For if their plan or work comes from man, this movement will definitely fail.
\v 39 But if their movement comes from God, we won't be able to stop them. It might even turn out that we're the ones who are opposing God!”
\p The Jewish leaders agreed with what Gamaliel said.
\v 40 Then they called the apostles and commanded that they be beaten with whips. After that, they forbid the apostles to speak about Jesus anymore, and the apostles were released.
\v 41 But the apostles left the Court council rejoicing, because they felt it was an honor to be persecuted for Jesus.
\v 42 And they didn't stop teaching the Good News that Jesus is the Christ, who was promised by God. They told it every day in God's Temple and in people's homes.
