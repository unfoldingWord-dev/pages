\s Paul on the island of Malta
\p
\v 1 After we arrived safely on land, we were told by the residents there that the island was named Malta.
\v 2 The people who lived on the island received us and helped us very kindly. They lit a fire to warm our bodies, because the rain was still falling and the weather was very cold.
\p
\v 3 But when Paul had gathered branches of wood and put them on the fire, a poisonous snake hidden in the wood came out because of the heat of the fire, and it bit Paul and clung to his hand.
\v 4 When the residents saw that, they said to each other, “This man is definitely a murderer, for even though he was saved from the danger of the sea, the goddess of Justice\f + \fr 28:4\fr* \fk the goddess of Justice \ft At that time, many people believed there was a goddess named Justice, who paid back the evil done by wicked people.\f* won't allow him to live.”
\v 5 But Paul shook his hand so that the snake came off and fell into the fire, and he didnt feel sick at all.
\v 6 Of course the residents thought that Paul's arm would become swollen, or that he would suddenly stop breathing and fall down. But after waiting quite a while, and seeing that nothing happened to him, they changed their minds and said, “Wow, this man is a god for sure!”
\p
\v 7 There was some land not far from that place, that was owned by the governor of the island, named Publius. He invited us to his house and received, and he was very good to us while we were guests there. We stayed with him for three days.
\v 8 At that time, the Publius' father was lying in bed because he was sick with a fever and diarrhea. Then Paul went to see him, and when Paul prayed while laying his hands on him, the man was instantly healed.
\v 9 After that happened, all the other sick people on the island came to Paul, and they also received divine healing.
\v 10-11 Because of that, they really respected us. After three months there, when the time came for us to continue our trip, they provided for all of our needs.
\s Paul sails from Malta towards Rome
\p After that, we left again on a ship which came from Alexandria, which had been on the island all winter. On the front of the ship was a carving of the Twin Gods.\f + \fr 28:10-11\fk twin gods \ft Meaning two idol statues named Castor and Pollux, who were twin gods that were worshiped by non-Jews.\f*
\v 12 We arrived at the city of Syracuse (on the island of Sicily) and stayed there for three days.
\v 13 From there we sailed across, and arrived at the city of Rhegium (at the tip of the province of Italy). And the next day, a wind blew from the south, so we were able to sail to the north and reached the city of Puteoli by the following day.
\v 14 We met some brothers in the faith in that city, and they asked us to stay at their house for seven days. Then we continued our trip and arrived in Rome.
\v 15 The brothers and sisters in the faith in the city of Rome had heard the news that we were on our way to the city. And they came to meet us at the two villages which are called the Market of Appius and the Three Inns.\f + \fr 28:15 \fk two villages … \ft The Market of Appius was seventy-one kilometers to the south of Rome. The Three Inns was fifty-five kilometers from Rome.\f* When Paul saw them, he thanked God and was encouraged.
\s Paul in Rome
\p
\v 16 After we arrived in Rome, the leader there gave permission for Paul to live on his own, and a soldier was ordered to guard him.
\p
\v 17 After three days, Paul invited all the Jewish leaders in Rome to meet him. After they gathered, he said to them, “Brothers, even though I didn't do anything to oppose our people or to break the customs of our forefathers, the Jews captured me in Jerusalem and handed me over to the Roman authorities.
\v 18 When the officials of the Roman kingdom in that place examined me, they wanted to release me, because they didn't find any wrong in me that makes me deserve the death sentence.
\v 19 But the Jews strongly opposed my being released. So for that reason, I was forced to request that my case be transferred to the high king. But I don't intend to accuse my own people.
\v 20 That's why I asked to meet and talk with you. For actually, it's precisely because of my faith in all of God's promises to our Jewish forefathers that I'm bound with this iron chain.”
\p
\v 21 Then they answered, “We haven't yet received a letter about you from the province of Judea. And so far there has not been a Jewish person who has come from there who has brought any news or said that you have done evil.
\v 22 But we want to hear from you directly, about this faith of yours, Brother. For we know that people everywhere speak against this movement.”
\p
\v 23 Then they set a time to meet with Paul again. And that day, more people came and gathered in the house where he was staying. Then from morning until night he explained and testified to them about God's kingdom. And he tried to convince them to believe in Jesus by using verses from Moses' Law and the writings of the prophets.
\v 24 There were some of them who believed because of Paul's teaching. But there were also others who didn't believe.
\v 25 So they debated among themselves and began to leave that place when Paul finished by saying this: “How fitting are the words spoken by the Holy Spirit through the prophet Isaiah to our forefathers! The Lord said,
\q1
\v 26 ‘Go to your people who are so stubborn and give them this message:
\q1 Even though you keep hearing news from God,
\q2 yet you'll never understand.
\q1 And even though you keep seeing what the Lord is doing,
\q2 yet you'll still never understand what's happening.
\q1
\v 27 For the hearts of these people don't want to understand anymore.
\q2 Their ears don't want to hear,
\q2 and their eyes are so tightly closed that they can't see what's true.
\q1 But if their minds weren't closed,
\q2 they could truly see with their eyes,
\q2 hear with their ears,
\q2 and understand with their minds.
\q1 Sad to say, they won't possibly return to Me,
\q2 even though I'm ready to heal them.’\x + Is. 6:9-10\x*
\p
\v 28-29 “So, Brothers, because you Jews don't want to hear the news of salvation from God, then you must know that God has now sent that news to people who aren't Jews. And they're receiving that news.”\f + \fr 28:29 \fk Verse 29 \ft Some ancient manuscripts add these words— which were later counted as verse 29: “After Paul said that, those Jews left while still debating among themselves because of very different opinions.”\f*
\p
\v 30 Then for two full years, Paul stayed in a house which he rented himself, and he received everyone who came to visit him.
\v 31 With great boldness and without being hindered by anyone, he told about God's kingdom and taught about the Lord Jesus— who is the Christ\f + \fr 28:31 \fk Christ \ft See the footnote in Acts. 2:36.\f* promised by God.
