\s Herod Agrippa persecutes the brothers and sisters in the faith
\p
\v 1 At that very time, King Herod ordered his soldiers to arrest and persecute some of the brothers and sisters in the faith.
\v 2 And he ordered his soldiers to kill James— the brother of John, with a sword.
\v 3 When he saw that this murder pleased the Jewish leaders, then he gave orders to his soldiers to arrest Peter too. This happened during the week of Passover celebration.\f + \fr 12:3 \fk Passover \ft Here “Passover” translates one word in the Greek language which means “the Celebration Day of Unleavened Bread”— which was celebrated for eight days, along with Passover Day. See Ex. 12.\f*
\v 4 When Peter was arrested and imprisoned, Herod ordered four groups of soldiers to guard him. Each group consisted of four soldiers. He planned to try Peter in public after Passover Day.
\v 5 While Peter was kept in jail, the church fervently prayed for him.
\s An angel releases Peter from jail
\p
\v 6 During the night before the day Herod was to try Peter, Peter was sleeping and was bound with two chains to the two soldiers who were on his right and left sides. There were other soldiers who were guarding the jail door too.
\v 7 An angel suddenly appeared there, and a light shone into the jail. Then the angel touched Peter on his side to wake him up and said, “Get up quickly!” At that moment, the chains fell off Peter's hands.
\v 8 Then the angel said to him, “Put on your tunic and sandals.” And Peter did that. Then the angel said again, “Put on your robe and follow me.”
\v 9 Then Peter followed him outside, but he didn't think that what the angel was doing was actually happening. He thought he was having a vision.
\v 10 They passed the first and second guards, and then they arrived at the iron gate, which was the gate leading to the city. The gate opened by itself and they just went out of there. After they had walked from the intersection of one street to another street, the angel suddenly disappeared.
\p
\v 11 At that very moment, Peter realized what had happened, and he said, “Now I know for certain that God sent His angel to save me from the hand of Herod and from all the evil plans of the Jews.”
\p
\v 12 When Peter realized what had happened, he went to the house of Mary— the mother of Mark. That Mark was also called John. Many people were gathered at the house and were praying.
\v 13 Peter knocked at the door, and a woman named Rhoda came to open the door. She worked as a servant in the house.
\v 14 When Rhoda recognized Peter's voice, she ran inside and forgot to open the door because she was so happy. Then she told everyone who had gathered, “Peter's standing at the front door!”
\v 15 They said to her, “You're crazy!” When she just kept saying that Peter was definitely outside, they said again, “Maybe it's the angel who's always on duty to guard him.”
\p
\v 16 Meanwhile, Peter kept knocking at the door, and when they opened the door and saw him, they were really amazed.
\v 17 But Peter signaled with his hand for them to be quiet, and then he told them how the Lord had released him from jail. After that he said to them, “Tell James\f + \fr 12:17 \fk James \ft this was Jesus' younger brother, who had become the leader of the Christian church in Jerusalem at the time. He was also the one who wrote the Letter of James.\f* and the other brothers and sisters in the faith about this.” Then he left for another place.
\p
\v 18 The next morning, the guards and the soldiers were in an uproar about how Peter could have gotten out of the jail.
\v 19 Herod ordered his other soldiers to look for Peter, but they didn't find him. Then Herod examined the sixteen soldiers who had guarded the jail. In the end, he gave an order for all of them to be killed.
\s Herod Agrippa dies
\p After that, Herod left the province of Judea for the city of Caesarea and stayed there for a while.
\v 20 Before this Herod and the people of the cities of Tyre and Sidon held grudges against each other. So on that visit, delegates from those two cities tried to make peace with the king, because their region depended on Herod's region for food. For that reason, they bribed an official named Blastus— who was the head of palace management, so that he would help them in that matter.
\p
\v 21 So on a certain day, Herod wore the special royal robes, sat on the throne of the kingdom, and gave a speech to them.
\v 22 The crowd from those two cities wanted to please the king, so they praised him by shouting, “What we're hearing is the voice of a god,\f + \fr 12:22 \fk voice of a god \ft This gathering of people from Tyre and Sidon didn't really think that Herod was a god. But they were trying to please Herod so that he would be ready to make peace with them again.\f* not the voice of a human!”
\v 23 An angel suddenly brought punishment on Herod because he received that praise and didn't give honor to God. Then Herod's intestines were eaten by worms so that he died.
\p
\v 24 At that time, God's Word still continued to spread and the number of people who believed in Jesus kept increasing more and more.
\p
\v 25 After Barnabas and Saul finished their ministry in Jerusalem, they returned to Antioch. Mark— who is also called John, went with them.
