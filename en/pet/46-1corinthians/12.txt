\s Special abilities given by God's Spirit
\p
\v 1 Now, Brothers and Sisters, I want you to understand about the special abilities that are given by God's Spirit.
\v 2 You yourselves remember that before you became believers, you let yourselves be influenced and led away to worship idols which aren't alive and don't speak.
\v 3 So because of that, I want you to realize that it isn't possible for a person who is led by God's Spirit to say, “Jesus is cursed.” And a person can't possibly say, “Jesus is Lord,” without the help of God's Spirit.
\p
\v 4 There are many kinds of special abilities which are given by God's Spirit as signs of God's kindness,\f + \fk special abilities … God's kindness \ft Literally translates one word in the Greek language. The root word is also translated ‘kindness’, and also has special meaning as a term for the abilities that are given by God's Spirit.\f* but all of those come from God's Spirit alone.
\v 5 And even though there are many kinds of ministries, all of them come from the same Lord.
\v 6 In that way, God works in different ways in each brother in the faith, but the One and Only God alone does all of that.
\p
\v 7 Each of those abilities are given to us as visible signs from God's Spirit, and should be used to strengthen each other.
\v 8 For example, God's Spirit gives the ability to one to give wise advice. To another, the same Spirit gives the ability to tell amazing knowledge.
\v 9 To still another, that same Spirit gives miraculous certainty.\f + \fk miraculous certainty \ft This word in the Greek language is also translated as “faith’ or ‘fully believe’.\f* And that one Spirit also gives the ability to heal sick people.
\v 10 And to another one of us, the Spirit gives the ability to do miracles too, and to another ,to prophesy, and to another, the ability to determine if news given comes from God's Spirit or an evil spirit. God's Spirit also gives the ability to another person to speak in various languages of the Spirit, and to yet another, the ability to translate what was given in those languages of the Spirit.
\v 11 The same and the one Spirit of God does all of this! And He's the one who determines what ability is given to each of our brothers or sisters in the faith.
\s All believers are like the body of Christ
\p
\v 12 So just the like the human body is only one but has many parts, in the same way we who are many are one body— which is the body of Christ.
\v 13 So there's no problem if our members come from the Jews or non-Jews, or slaves or free people. For each of us has been baptised into that one Holy Spirit— or it's as if we have each drunk pure water from the same cup. This means that the one Spirit has made all of us become like one body— the body of Christ.\f + \fr 12:13 \fk spiritually … baptized … \ft This verse has been translated according to the interpretation that Paul used the word 'baptized' with a spiritual meaning, in which God's Spirit is illustrated twice as water— that is like water of baptism and like pure water which we have drunk. (John 1:33; Acts 1:5) But according to another interpretation, Paul used the word 'baptized' here, not to illustrate something that has happened spiritually, but with the meaning of one's physical body being baptized in water. According to this interpretation, this verse can be translated as follows: When we were baptized in water, God's Spirit unified us. So there is no longer a problem if our members come from the Jews or non-Jews, or if they're people who have been sold as slaves or free people. When we believe in Christ, that one Spirit lives already is inside each of us— as if we all drank the same pure water.\f*
\p
\v 14 For of course, the human body doesn't consist of just one part, but has many parts.
\v 15 If for example, the foot could be jealous and say, “I'm not a hand. So I'm not part of this body.” Yet those words don't change the situation, and that foot remains part of the body.
\v 16 In the same way, the ear could say, “I'm not an eye. So I'm not part of this body.” But what the ear said wouldn't change the situation. That ear is still part of the body.
\v 17 If the whole body consisted of just an eye, the body couldn't hear anything. And if the whole body consisted of just an ear, the body couldn't smell anything.
\v 18-19 So if the whole body consisted of only one part, then it couldn't be called a body any more. God is the one who arranges each part so that it functions in the body according to His will.
\v 20 So the body is one, but it has many parts.
\p
\v 21 That's why the eye can't say to the hand, “I don't need you.” And the head can't say to the foot, “I don't need you.”
\v 22-23 On the contrary, the parts of the body that seem weak or are considered less respectable, are actually very important, and are always given special attention. So we protect the parts of the body that aren't fit to be seen with clothing. In that way, the parts of the body that are considered less respectable are always given special attention.
\v 24 Whereas the parts of our bodies which are considered more respectable don't need special attention. In that way, God has unified the body, so that the parts which are considered weak and less respectable are given attention and special respect,
\v 25 so that the body isn't divided, but each of the parts pays attention to, and cares for each other.
\v 26 If one part of the body suffers, then all the other parts of the body also suffer. Or if one part of the body is praised, all the other parts of the body feel glad too.
\p
\v 27 We're all the body of Christ, and each of you is a part of His body.
\v 28 And in the whole unity of Christ's church, God has set it up as follows:
\q first are those who've been chosen as apostles,
\q second, are those chosen to prophesy,
\q and third, are those chosen to teach.
\q Then there are some of us whom God chooses to do miracles,
\q and there are some who receive the special ability to heal sick people,
\q or to help other people,
\q or to become leaders,
\q or to speak in different languages of the Spirit.
\m
\v 29 So not every member is chosen to become an apostle, or to prophesy, or to teach. And not all of us can do miracles.
\v 30 Not all of us have the ability to heal sick people, or speak in different languages of the Spirit. And not everyone can translate what's given in those languages of the Spirit.
\v 31 But you should all long to receive the abilities that are most important.
\s Loving is more important than all of the special abilities
\p And now I will show you the best thing!
