\s Help for brothers and sisters in the faith
\p
\v 1 And now I want to give instructions about the donation that is being collected for God's people who are in the province of Judea. I want to give the same advice that I gave to the churches in Galatia:
\v 2 Every Sunday,\f + \fr 16:2 \fk Sunday \ft Literally, “the first day of every week.”\f* each of you should set aside a sum of money from the income the Lord gives you. Collect that money and keep it safe, so that you don't need to collect anymore money when I come.
\v 3 When I come, we'll send some people that you choose to bring that gift to Jerusalem. They'll also take an accompanying letter.
\v 4 Or if you feel it's best, I will also go with them.
\s Paul's plans
\p
\v 5 On my way to visit you, I plan to go through the province of Macedonia.
\v 6 I'll probably stay with you for some time— even till the end of winter. That way, you can help me to continue my journey wherever I go,
\v 7 because I don't want to visit you for just a short time. I hope that I can stay longer with you— if the Lord is willing.
\v 8 But I'll stay in Ephesus until the holiday of Pentecost.
\v 9 I've decided that because the opportunity to succeed in giving the news of salvation is wide-open to me here. But there are also many who oppose my work.
\p
\v 10 If Timothy visits you, try hard so that he doesn't have to worry about anything as long as he's with you, because he works for the Lord— just as I do.
\v 11 So don't let anyone put him down. But help him on his journey with the blessings that you have, so that he can return to me safely. For I'm waiting for him along with the other brothers in the faith who'll accompany him.
\p
\v 12 Now regarding our brother Apollos: I've truly urged him to visit you along with those other brothers, but he refuses to go now. He'll look for a good opportunity to visit you.
\s Paul finishes his letter
\p
\v 13 Beware. Continue to believe completely in Christ. Fight bravely for Jesus, and keep holding on to Him.
\v 14 You should do everything out of love for one another.
\p
\v 15 You know that Stephanas and his family were the first people in Achaia to believe in Jesus. And they themselves have volunteered to minister to God's people. For that reason Brothers and Sisters, I ask you
\v 16 to obey them and all the other people who work as hard as they do in the Lord's service.
\p
\v 17 I was very glad that Stephanas, Fortunatus and Achaicus came. I felt lonely before, because all of you weren't with me. But now with them here, I feel like I'm with you again.
\v 18 They've comforted and encouraged my heart— just like they often do among you. You should always appreciate people like them.
\p
\v 19 The churches here in Asia send greetings to you. Aquila and Priscilla send greetings to you full of love in the Lord. The church that always meets in their house also sends greetings to you.
\v 20 All of the brothers and sisters in the faith here send greetings to you. And as soon as you read this letter, as people who've been made holy by God, you should give each other greetings that are full of love.\f + \fk made holy … greetings that are full of love \ft Literally, “holy kiss.”\f*
\p
\v 21 I, Paul, am writing this last greeting with my own hand.
\p
\v 22 May all the people who don't love the Lord Jesus receive a severe punishment from Him!
\p Come, O Lord!\f + \fk Come, O Lord \ft Paul literally used one word in the Hebrew/Aramaic language— which is “maranatha.”\f*
\p
\v 23 I pray that the Lord Jesus is always kind to you.
\p
\v 24 I love all of you who are one with Christ Jesus too.
