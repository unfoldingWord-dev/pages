\c 13
\p
\v 1 For example, if I've been given the special ability to speak in every human language, even the languages used by angels, but if I don't love other people, my ability wouldn't have any meaning at all— just like a bell or a gong which only makes noise.
\v 2 And if I have the special ability to prophesy, and have the ability of knowledge so that I can understand everything— even God's secret plans, and also have the ability of great faith— so that mountains move at my command, but if I don't love other people, all of my special abilities don't have any meaning at all!
\v 3 Or if I proudly give all of my treasures to poor people, and even surrender my body as a sacrifice,\f + \fr 13:3 \fk proudly … \ft In old manuscripts there is a slight change in spelling this word— so the word has also been translated “to be burned.” The oldest manuscripts use the spelling “proudly.”\f* yet if I don't love, all of that has no meaning!
\p
\v 4 The nature of love is patient, generous, not jealous, doesn't brag about itself, and isn't arrogant.
\v 5 Love doesn't act impolitely, doesn't seek its own self importance, doesn't get angry easily, and doesn't remember wrongs that others have done.
\v 6 Love doesn't rejoice when it sees other people doing what's evil, but rejoices when it sees them doing what's right.
\v 7 Love is strong so that it can endure facing anything, and love is always ready to believe and hope what's best about other people, and love is always patient in every situation.
\p
\v 8 Love will never cease to be important! But the time will come when the special abilities won't be needed anymore— including the abilities to prophesy, to speak in languages of the Spirit, or to give knowledge.
\v 9 The special abilities to prophesy or give knowledge are certainly useful now, of course, but can't convey those things completely.
\v 10 But when Jesus returns later on, our knowledge will become complete, and the special abilities that are now incomplete will be done away because they won't be needed anymore.
\p
\v 11 When I was still small, I spoke, thought, and made plans just like a little child. But when I became an adult, I stopped doing things that are characteristic of children.
\v 12 It's like that with us too. It's as if we're looking into a blurry mirror now, but there'll be a time later on when we'll see clearly. Now my knowledge is incomplete, but there'll be a time later on when I will understand everything in the greatest possible depth— just like God already knows me.
\v 13 So, these three things will always be important— which are faith, hope and love. But the most important of these three things is love!
