\s God's wisdom does not lead to divisions in the church
\p
\v 1 And Brothers and Sisters, I couldn't speak to you before as if speaking to people who are already one with God's Spirit. I was forced to speak to you as people who were still controlled by their own desires— that is as if to spiritual babies in the matter of following Christ.
\v 2 The teaching that I gave you was like milk— not like solid food. I did that because you weren't yet able to receive adult food. You still even now aren't ready for eating spiritual food like that.
\v 3 Because you are still controlled by your bodily desires. The fact that you're still jealous of each other, and quarreling, proves that you aren't yet free from those desires. It means that you're still living like worldly people.
\v 4 That is proved in that there are those of you who say, “I'm a follower of Paul,” and others say “I'm a follower of Apollos.” When you talk like that, you act just like worldly people.
\p
\v 5 Is Apollos an important person? No. Am I, Paul, an important person? No. We're just servants of the Lord who are carrying out His tasks, and who helped you believe fully in Him.
\v 6 So I'm the one who planted the seed, Apollos is the one who watered it. But the One who makes that seed grow is God alone!
\v 7 Because of that, the servant who planted and the servant who watered aren't important. God alone is important because He's the One who makes that seed able to grow.
\v 8 So the servant who plants and the servant who waters actually have the same purpose and the same status. And each servant will receive a reward according to his ministry work.
\v 9 For we are equals as God's servants, and you are like God's own field.
\p And you're also God's new Temple.
\v 10 According to God's kindness which was given to me, I was given the task to lay the foundation of God's Temple— that is I was the one who taught you about Christ Jesus. So I was given the task of a builder. But now other people are building on top of the foundation that I made. For that reason, each person should be careful about the way he builds on top of that foundation.
\v 11 Don't anyone try building on some other foundation! Christ Jesus is the only foundation!
\v 12-13 And the quality of each person's work who builds on top of that foundation will be tested. On the Judgment Day\f + \fk the Judgment Day \ft Literally, “that day.”\f* it will be seen whether or not the materials that were used by each person to build will stand the test. It will be seen if a person built a room with materials like gold, silver, or gem stones that stand the test. And it'll also be obvious if a person built a room with materials that are just temporary in nature, like wood, grass, or straw, because each person's work will be tested by fire on the Judgment Day.
\v 14 If the room that was built still remains standing after being tested, the person who built it will receive a reward.
\v 15 If his room burns up, he'll feel the loss. Even so, he'll be saved, but he'll be like a person who runs away when his house is burned.
\p
\v 16 So you must understand that we're all God's Temple and God's Spirit lives in us.
\v 17 If a person destroys God's Temple, then God will also destroy him. For God's Temple is holy, and we, God's people, are like His Temple.
\p
\v 18 Don't let any of you deceive yourselves. If any of you feels that he's wise according to this world's standard, let him be stupid according to this world's standard, so that he can be truly wise according to the Lord's standard.
\v 19 For the world's wisdom is stupidity to God. As it's written in the Holy Bible, “God uses the craftiness of wise people like a trap to catch them.”\x + Job 5:13\x*
\v 20 And it's also written, “The Lord knows that the thoughts of wise people are useless.”\x + Ps. 94:11\x*
\v 21 For that reason, don't brag anymore about being followers of me, or Apollos, or another teacher, because for us who are one with Christ, everything becomes our property:
\v 22 Paul, Apollos, Peter,\f + \fk Peter \ft Literally Paul wrote his name as in the Hebrew language— “Cephas.”\f* this world, life or death, both things that are now and things that will come— everything is ours.
\v 23 That's true because we're all Christ's possessions, and Christ is God's possession.
