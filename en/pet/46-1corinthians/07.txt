\s About marriage
\p
\v 1 Now I will talk about the things that you wrote to me about. Yes, I think it's good if a man doesn't have a wife and doesn't have sexual relations with a woman.\f + \fk have a wife … with a woman \ft Literally, “touch a woman.” Paul is quoting from a letter from the Corinthian church.\f*
\v 2 But because of the danger of immorality, it's best for every man to have his own wife who'll meet his sexual needs. In the same way, it's best for every woman to have her own husband.\f + \fr 7:2 \fk meet… sexual needs \ft In Greek the words “have a wife” and “have a husband” are polite expressions that mean the sexual relation between a husband and wife.\f*
\v 3 And the husband has to meet his wife's sexual needs. The same for the wife toward her husband.
\v 4 For the wife doesn't have authority over her own body, but it's her husband who has authority over her body. It is the same with the husband. He doesn't have authority over his own body, but it's his wife who has that authority.
\v 5 Don't refuse to give your bodies to each other, except for a short time in agreement together. The reason for that is to have a special time to truly pray, and then be reunited. That's necessary so that the devil doesn't tempt you if you can't restrain your passion.
\v 6 I'm saying this to give you permission, so that you may have a special time like that for a short time. That isn't a command.
\v 7 Actually, I wish everyone was like me, but I realize that every follower of Christ receives his own blessing\f + \fk blessing \ft The same word in the Greek language is also translated as 'gift' and 'ability'.\f* through God's kindness. There are those who receive the blessing, like me, to live without a wife, but others receive the blessing of having a wife.
\p
\v 8 But for the person who doesn't yet have a husband or wife, and also for widows and widowers, I recommend this: It would also be better for you to live unbound to a wife or a husband— like me.
\v 9 But if you can't control yourself, it's better for you to have a husband or wife. For it's better to marry than to be burned by sexual passion.
\p
\v 10 And now I'm giving a command to the people who are already married: This command doesn't come from me alone, but from the Lord. A wife mustn't break off the relationship with her husband.
\v 11 But if a wife has already gone so far as to separate from her husband, she must keep living alone without having a husband anymore. Or she can make peace again with her husband. A husband must not divorce his wife, either.
\p
\v 12 And now I want to give more advice to you in another situation. This advice is from me alone— not from the Lord: If a brother in the faith has a wife who doesn't yet believe in the Lord, but his wife is still willing to live with him, then the husband must not divorce her.
\v 13 And vice versa, if a woman has a husband who doesn't yet believe in the Lord and her husband is still willing to live with her, then that wife must not divorce her husband.
\v 14 For a husband who doesn't yet believe is legitimate\f + \fk legitimate \ft Literally, “made holy.”\f* in God's eyes because he's one with his wife who already believes in Jesus. And a wife who doesn't yet believe is legitimate because she's one with a husband who already believes. If that wasn't so, their children would be considered to be unclean by the Lord. But now they've been accepted by the Lord.
\p
\v 15 But if a husband or wife who doesn't yet believe in Christ decides to divorce the brother or sister who's a follower of Christ, let him or her divorce. If that happens, the brother or sister in the faith isn't bound anymore. For God's will is that we live calmly and peacefully with everyone.
\v 16 This is the reason for my advice: We always hope that your husband or wife, who doesn't believe, will later become a believer because of your example, and be saved in the end.
\s Live calmly in God's eyes in the situation in which you were called by God
\p
\v 17 I advise every believer to live according to this rule: Continue to live in the same situation as when God called you to become a follower of Christ— which is the situation of life that God had given to you at that time. This is a principle that I teach in all the churches.
\v 18 For example, if a man was circumcised at the time God called him to become a follower of Christ, he doesn't need to cover up the sign of his circumcision. And if a man hasn't yet been circumcised when he follows Christ, he doesn't need to be circumcised.
\v 19 Circumcision or uncircumcision isn't important. What's important is obeying God's commands.
\p
\v 20 Everyone should continue to live in a similar situation as when he was called by God to become a follower of Christ.
\v 21 For example, if you had been sold to work as a slave when God called you to follow Christ, that isn't a problem. But of course, if you get the opportunity to become free, use that opportunity.
\v 22 A slave who wasn't physically free when the Lord called him has become like a free man because he's one with the Lord. In the same way, a person who was free when the Lord called him has really become Christ's slave.
\v 23 We've all been bought with a very high price! So, let's not become servants of people!
\v 24 So Brothers and Sisters, the rule is let's all live calmly in God's eyes in the same situation as when He called us to be Christ's disciples.
\s Question about marriage
\p
\v 25 And now I'm writing about young women who aren't yet married.\f + \fk aren't yet married \ft Literally, “virgin.”\f* I haven't received a command from the Lord about this, but I'm giving my opinion. And because the Lord's great compassion was shown to me by Him, I think that this advice can be trusted.
\v 26 Because we're living in difficult times, I think it's better for each of you to continue to live calmly in your present situation.
\v 27 So, if you have a wife, don't divorce her. And if you aren't bound to a wife, don't try to find a wife.
\v 28 But if you decide to marry, it isn't sin. So if a young woman marries, it isn't sin. It should be understood that a person who's already married will have more trouble in his life. So the reason I gave that advice is to spare you that kind of trouble.
\p
\v 29 However Brothers and Sisters, I mean this: We don't have much time left! So from now on, a person who has a wife must use his time to serve the Lord as if he didn't have a wife.
\v 30 Similarly the one who is sad, let him live as though he is not sad. The one who is happy, let him live as if he wasn't happy. And the one who buys earthly possessions, it would be best if he lives as if he doesn't have anything.
\v 31 Also the one who uses the things of this world, let him live as if those things have no meaning for him. Because this world will soon completely disappear!
\p
\v 32 My advice is that you don't worry about this life. A person who isn't married is free to give himself fully to the Lord's work. So he just tries to please the Lord.
\v 33 Whereas a person who's married will be busy with worldly matters— that is he needs to try to please his wife.
\v 34 So his attention is divided between pleasing his wife and pleasing the Lord. In the same way, a woman who doesn't have a husband can give herself fully to the Lord's work. So she only tries to please the Lord— both with her body and her spirit. Whereas a woman who's married will be busy with matters of this world, because she's trying to please her husband.
\v 35 I'm just giving this advice to help you— not to limit you. I want you to do what's proper, so that you can serve the Lord as well as possible, and without worrying about worldly things.
\p
\v 36 But if a man thinks that he isn't doing the best thing toward his fiancee, if that woman is getting older, and he himself feels it's appropriate to marry, he should do as he desires. If they get married they are not sinning.
\v 37 But if a man has decided in his heart that he doesn't need to marry, and he also thinks he's able to control himself, he's free to keep living unmarried. A person who's convinced in his heart like that does well by not marrying his fiancee.
\v 38 So, if a man marries his fiancee, he does well. And the person who can serve the Lord without marrying does even better.
\p
\v 39 It needs to be remembered that a woman is bound to her husband as long as her husband is alive. But if her husband dies, the woman is free to marry a man whom she likes. But she can only marry a man who fully believes in the Lord.
\v 40 But it's my opinion that the widow will be happier if she doesn't marry again, and I think that God's Spirit also agrees with my advice.
