\s Warning from the history of God's people
\p
\v 1 I'm telling you this, Brothers and Sisters, because I want you to be aware of what happened to our forefathers during Moses' time. God protected them, and led them by a cloud which moved ahead of them,\f + \fk cloud \ft There was a cloud which showed the Israelites the way out of Egypt and across the Red Sea during the day. See Ex.13:20-22; 14:19-20.\f* and they walked on ground in the midst of the sea which had been split in two.
\v 2 And when they were covered by the cloud and walked across the sea, it was as if they were baptized as followers of Moses.
\v 3 Then they ate the same spiritual food,
\v 4 and also drank the same spiritual drink— that is they drank from the large rock that accompanied them\f + \fr 10:4 \fk rock that accompanied them \ft These stories are found in Ex. 17 and Num. 20. It is not know if the wilderness of Sin is a different or same place as the wilderness of Zin. Paul interprets them as two places and says that the large rock accompanied them because he is giving a symbolic meaning to that rock.\f* and which had a spiritual meaning. That large rock symbolized Christ.
\v 5 But in the end, God wasn't pleased with most of them, so their dead bodies were left all along the road in the desert.
\p
\v 6 What happened is an example for us, so that we won't desire evil things like they desired, and did.
\v 7 And we must not worship idols like some of them did. It's written about them in the Holy Bible, “After they had a party of eating and drinking, then they started doing immoral things and worshiped idols.”\x + Ex. 32:6.\x*
\v 8 Let's not get involved in immorality like some of them did, and as a result twenty-three thousand people died in one day.
\v 9 Let's not test Christ either\f + \fr 10:9 \fk Christ \ft In some copies in the Greek language: the Lord.\f* as some of them did, so that they died of snake bites.
\v 10 And let's not complain like some of them did too, so that God sent the angel which brought death upon them.
\p
\v 11 The things that happened to them are an example for us, and those things were written in God's Word as a warning for us who live now in these end times.
\v 12 For that reason, the person who thinks he's standing firm should be careful that he doesn't fall.
\v 13 So know this: Every temptation that each of you face is just a temptation normally experienced by man. God is faithful to us, so He won't let you be tempted beyond your ability. And at the time you're tempted, He'll give you a way out, so that you can endure it.
\p
\v 14 For that reason, Brothers and Sisters whom I love, keep yourselves far away from worshiping idols!
\v 15 I'm urging you with full awareness that you're wise people. So you're capable of deciding for yourselves if this teaching of mine is true.
\v 16 When we celebrate the Holy Supper, it's clear that the holy cup of wine\f + \fr 10:16 \fk holy cup of wine \ft This is the cup which was used by the followers of Christ when celebrating the Holy Supper to remember the death of Christ.\f* and the one for which we give thanks illustrates that we take part in the blood of Christ. In the same way, the bread that we break illustrates that we take part in the body of Christ.
\v 17 Even though we're many, yet through the Holy Supper, it's seen that we truly are one body, because we all take a part of that one piece of bread.
\v 18 In another example, think about when the Israelites offered an animal as a sacrifice. When they ate the meat of that animal, everyone who took part in eating it was considered to have received the same blessing.
\p
\v 19 My purpose in giving these examples is to teach about idols like this: Meat that was offered to idols truly has no meaning, and idols aren't things that have power.
\v 20 But you should know that something offered to idols is actually an offering to evil spirits— not to God. And I don't want you to take part in worshiping evil spirits!
\v 21 Each of you must not drink from the Lord's cup and then drink from the cup of evil spirits too. You can't eat at the table of the Lord's supper and then take part in the table of evil spirits too.
\v 22 Or are you making the Lord jealous on purpose?!\f + \fk make the Lord jealous \ft Read Deut. 32:16, 17.\f* Or do you think that you're greater than Him?!
\s Use your freedom to glorify God
\p
\v 23 Once again, of course, some will respond, “We followers of Christ are allowed to do anything.” But I will answer that not all deeds are useful. There are things that are permitted, but don't strengthen the confidence of our brothers in the faith.
\v 24 Let's not just seek what's best for ourselves, but let's try to do what's best for our other brothers and sisters in the faith.
\p
\v 25 So you can eat all the meat that's sold at the market, and don't need to ask where it comes from, so that it doesn't become an opportunity for you to feel guilty.
\v 26 For we know that “the earth and everything in it is the Lord's.”\x + Ps. 24:1; 50:12; 89:11.\x*
\p
\v 27 And also, if a person who doesn't yet fully believe in Christ invites you to eat at his house, and if you want to, eat everything that's served to you. Don't ask where the meat comes from, so that it doesn't make you feel guilty.
\v 28 But if there's a brother in the faith in that house who tells you, “Be careful, that meat is leftover from an offering to idols,” then don't eat it, in order to respect the opinion,and guard the heart of the brother who told you that.
\v 29 Although eating that meat isn't a problem for you yourself, yet it's clear that that brother considers it to be wrong. Well, if so, surely some of you will say, “Hey, why do I have to be limited by the opinion and heart of someone else?
\v 30 If I give thanks to God before enjoying that food, it isn't fair for another person to consider me a sinner!”
\p
\v 31 My answer is, whatever we do— whether it's eating, or drinking, or some other thing, let's do it to glorify God!
\v 32 And let's not do something that's considered to be wrong— whether in the eyes of the Jews, the non-Jews, or the brothers in the faith in God's churches.
\v 33 For that reason, I always try to please everyone in everyway. That means I try to put the importance of other people first above the importance of my own self. I do that so that they may become followers of Christ and are saved.
