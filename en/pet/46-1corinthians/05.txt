\s Problem of conduct in the church
\p
\v 1 I'm very concerned with the news that there is very shameful immorality among you, and it's a kind of immorality that never happens even among people groups who don't know the Lord! For I hear that there's a person who has taken his father's wife.
\v 2 In this situation, it isn't proper for you to be arrogant and brag of being great people of God! It would be better for you to weep! Then he who committed that sin has to be removed from your midst.
\v 3 Even though I'm not with you in person, I feel like my spirit is with you. And I've already judged the person who committed that sin, as if I was there with you.
\v 4 So when you've gathered in the name of our Lord Jesus, and my spirit, with our Lord Jesus' authority is with you,
\v 5 turn that person over to the devil. That should be done so that— through the punishment given by the devil, his bodily desires can be destroyed so that his spirit can be saved on the day the Lord comes.
\p
\v 6 Of course it isn't proper now for you to brag about yourselves as good people of God. Remember this proverb. “Just a little yeast makes all of the dough rise.”
\v 7 Just like it's always done before the Jews celebrate the Passover, throw out all of the old yeast— that is sin, so that you become like a new batch of dough. For we're actually like bread without yeast. Our sacrificial Passover lamb is Christ— who has been sacrificed to purify us.\f + \fk Passover lamb is Christ \ft The Passover lamb, Christ, is the sacrifice for His people, like the lamb that was slaughtered for the Jewish Passover.\f*
\v 8 For that reason, let's live like people who celebrate Passover. It isn't proper for us to eat bread that's made with old yeast. (That means that we can't be involved in old sins and wickedness, like we did before we knew Christ.) We're like people who take part in the Passover celebration by eating bread without yeast— which symbolizes us living pure and according to true teaching.
\p
\v 9 I've written you a letter with the command not to associate with people who are immoral.
\v 10 Now I need to explain that I don't mean that we not associate with all those in this world who do immoral things, or people who sin in other ways— like people who are greedy, people who cheat others to get money, or worshipers of idols. To avoid people like that we would have to leave this world!
\v 11 But what I mean is you must avoid people who call themselves brothers in the faith, but meanwhile they still commit immorality, or sins in some other way— specifically being greedy, worshiping idols, or people who slander other people, drunkards, or people who like to cheat others to get money. Don't ever have contact with people like that who only pretend to be good good people— not even eating with them!
\p
\v 12-13 It isn't our business to judge people who aren't brothers in the faith. That's God's business. But you must control, and be ready to judge people who've become members of the church. Like it's written in the Lord's Word, “Drive the evil person out from among you!”\x + Deut. 22:21, 24.\x*
