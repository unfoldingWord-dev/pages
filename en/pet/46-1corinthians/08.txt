\s Teaching about meat offered to idols
\p
\v 1 Now I'm writing about the leftover meat from animals which have been sacrificed to idols. Christians often feel that we all have knowledge about this. But we need to remember that knowledge often makes us arrogant. Whereas love is more important than knowledge, because love helps our brothers and sisters in the faith to grow.
\v 2 If any of you thinks he has quite enough knowledge already, he doesn't actually know anything!
\v 3 Whereas the person who loves God is the one who is pleasing in God's eyes.
\p
\v 4 So regarding the sale of leftover meat from animals sacrificed to idols: We know that an idol illustrates something that doesn't actually exist and is powerless. For there's no other god except the One and Only God.
\v 5 For although other people think that there are many gods or many lords— both in heaven and on earth,
\v 6 yet for us there's only one God— the one whom we call Father. Everything comes from Him, and we live for Him. And there's only one Lord— who is Christ Jesus. Everything was created by means of Jesus, and we live because of Him.
\p
\v 7 But not all of Christ's followers have this knowledge. There are brothers and sisters in the faith who used to be idol worshipers. So if they eat meat leftover from a sacrifice, they still feel like they're involved in worshiping idols. Their hearts feel guilty easily because they remember their previous religion.
\v 8 But food doesn't actually change our status before God. Refusing to eat doesn't bring us closer to God. And if we do eat something, that also doesn't make us better before God.
\p
\v 9 Even so, we have to be careful so that our freedom doesn't make our weak brother fall into sin, because he feels guilty easily.
\v 10 Just think, what happens if you, who feel that you can eat everything, are seen eating meat in a restaurant, and that restaurant usually sells meat leftover from idol sacrifices.\f + \fr 8:10 \fk restaurant … \ft Paul literally wrote one word that means, “idol's worship house.” In Paul's day, there were temples for idols in the city of Corinth that were close to some restaurants. In this verse, Paul possibly meant Christians who were seen in the restaurants which were near to those idol's temples— where everyone who wanted to eat there wasn't directly involved in worshiping idols. But the food sold there was leftover from sacrifices made to that idol.\f* If a brother in the faith sees you eating that meat, and he used to live as an idol worshiper, he'll desire to eat that meat again, of course. But if he eats that meat, he'll easily feel guilty in his heart.
\v 11 If that happens, you who brag about your knowledge have destroyed that brother in the faith, even though he's someone whom Jesus has saved through His death too— just like you.
\v 12 In that way, you've sinned against your brother in the faith. When you set an example that causes a brother who's weak to do what he considers to be sin, you're also sinning in Christ's sight.
\v 13 So if the meat that I eat can cause my brother to fall into sin, I won't eat meat again as long as I live! And I'm ready to stop eating meat forever, so that I won't make my brother in the faith sin.
