\v 1-2 Dear Brothers and Sisters of the faith in God's church at Corinth— that is to you who've been made holy because you're one with Christ Jesus: You were also called to become God's people with everyone everywhere who believes in Christ Jesus— who's their Lord and ours.
\p Greetings from Paul, who was called by the will of God to be an apostle of Christ Jesus, and from Sosthenes— our brother in the faith.
\p
\v 3 May God the Father, and our Lord Christ Jesus always be kind to each of you,and watch over you so that you live calmly under God’s protection!
\s Paul gives thanks to God
\p
\v 4 I always give thanks to God because clearly His kindness has been given to you through Christ Jesus.
\v 5 For you've been blessed in everything, enriched in all words and knowledge. This happened because you're one with Jesus.
\v 6 And this proves that the testimony I gave to you about Christ is true.
\v 7 And as a result, you have all of the special abilities given by God's Spirit while we wait for the coming of our Lord Christ Jesus.
\v 8 Jesus will always strengthen you too, so that you can endure to the end, so that you'll be without fault on the day our Lord Christ Jesus comes.
\v 9 God can always be trusted. He's the one who called you to share in life with His Son Christ Jesus— our Lord.
\s A problem in the church of Corinth
\p
\v 10 Brothers and Sisters, I sincerely ask you in the name of our Lord Christ Jesus that you be of the same mind, so that there are no divisions among you. May you truly be one in heart and mind.
\p
\v 11 Brothers and Sisters, I urge this because some people from the Chloe's family have told me that there's quarreling among you.
\v 12 What I mean is: There are those of you who say, “I'm a follower of Paul,” while another says, “I'm a follower of Apollos.” Another one says, “I'm a follower of Peter,”\f + \fk Peter \ft Literally, “Cephas,” which is his name in the Hebrew language. Both of Peter's names mean “a large rock.”\f* and still another says, “I'm a follower of Christ.”
\v 13 Just think: Christ can't be divided! And Paul wasn't crucified for you! You weren't baptized in Paul's name either!
\v 14 For that reason, I'm thanking God that I didn't baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius.
\v 15 I'm thankful because now no one can say that you were baptized in my name.
\v 16 (Of course I did baptize Stephanas' family, but I don't remember if I baptized anyone else.)
\v 17 For Christ didn't give me the task to baptize people, but to tell the Good News. And He doesn't want me to tell it by using speaking skills in a worldly human way, so that the spiritual power that's in the message of Christ's cross\f + \fr 1:17 \fk cross \ft Paul used the word 'cross' to illustrate the News of Salvation, especially Christ's death to redeem man from God's punishment for each of their sins.\f* isn't useless.
\s God's Power and Wisdom in Christ Jesus
\p
\v 18 For the teaching about Christ's cross is something that looks stupid to people who are heading for destruction, but that teaching is the power of God to us who are saved .
\v 19 This agrees with God's Word where He says,
\q1 “I will destroy the wisdom of wise people.
\q2 I will confuse the understanding of clever people.”\x + Is. 29:14\x*
\p
\v 20 So now all wise people, the highly educated people, and the expert debaters of this present time should feel ashamed. God has made the world's wisdom be stupidity.
\v 21 For this is what God wanted with His wisdom: The world wouldn't know God through its own wisdom. So God was pleased to use telling the Good News, which looks stupid, to save believers.
\p
\v 22 For the Jews ask for miracles as proof, whereas non-Jews don't want to believe if the teaching doesn't agree with what they consider to be wise.
\v 23 But we're proclaiming the news about Christ who was crucified. That message is a big problem for the Jews, and non-Jews consider that news to be stupid.
\v 24 But Christ is God's power and wisdom to everyone who has been called by God— whether Jews or non-Jews.
\v 25 For God's teaching that's considered stupid is wiser than human wisdom. And God's character traits that seem weak are stronger than human strength.
\p
\v 26 Brothers and Sisters, remember your own status when you were chosen by God! Not many of you were considered to be wise in man's eyes. Not many of you were considered to be great or rich people.
\v 27 But God chose teachings, and believers who were considered stupid by people of the world, to shame people who are considered to be wise. And God chose the news, and we who are considered weak by people of the world, to shame strong people.
\v 28 Even we and our faith are considered unimportant, despised, and completely meaningless to people of this world. But that's exactly why we and our faith were chosen by God to do away with things considered to be important by people of high status, and who are considered to be smart!
\v 29 God did that so that no one could brag about himself before Him.
\v 30 Now God Himself is the one who has made you one with Christ Jesus. And God is the One who has made Christ to be our source of wisdom. And Christ is the one who makes us right before God, and He has also made us pure, as well as freeing us from sin.
\v 31 Therefore as it's written in God's Word, “The one who wants to express pride, must only take pride about what the Lord has done— and not take pride in himself!”\x + Jer. 9:24; 2 Cor. 10:17.\x*
