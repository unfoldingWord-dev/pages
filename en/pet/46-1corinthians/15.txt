\s The most important things in the Good News
\p
\v 1 And now Brothers and Sisters, I want to remind you about the Good News that I've given you. This is the news that you've received and still hold onto until now.
\v 2 And through that news you're gaining salvation— if you keep firmly believing what I told you! If not, then you became believers for no reason!
\p
\v 3 For I told you the most important news which I've received— which is that Christ Jesus has died to bear the punishment for our sins— as it's written in the Holy Bible.
\v 4 After He was buried, on the third day God made Christ come live again from death— as it's written in the Holy Bible.
\v 5 I also told that Jesus showed Himself to Peter, and then to His twelve apostles.\f + \fk His twelve apostles \ft Paul writes “the twelve”— which had become a term for the apostles of Jesus. He still used that term even though Jesus didn't appear to Judas from the village of Cariot.\f*
\v 6 After that, Jesus showed Himself at the same time to more than five hundred of our brothers and sisters in the faith. Most of them are still alive till now, but some of them have died.
\v 7 After that, Jesus showed Himself to His younger brother James, and then to all of the apostles.
\v 8 And finally, He also showed Himself to me. So it can be said that I became an apostle like a baby who was born late— after ten months.
\p
\v 9 So I think of myself as the most lowly of all of the apostles. In fact, I'm not even worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted God's people before I believed in Jesus.
\v 10 But I've become like I am now only because of God's kindness. And it's proven that I didn't waste His kindness! For I work harder than the other apostles. But that isn't because of my own strength, or because I'm so zealous, rather it's because of being motivated by God's kindness which is in my heart.
\v 11 So whether it was I, or the other apostles who gave the news of salvation to you, that news is what we always tell, and that news is also what you've believed.
\s After death, we'll live again
\p
\v 12 So, if we apostles always tell that Christ was made alive again from death, why do some of you say that we believers won't be made alive again after death?
\v 13 For if we aren't made alive again after death, it means that Christ was never made to live again after death either.
\v 14 And suppose that Christ was never made alive again, then the news that we communicate is totally useless, and your faith is just useless too.
\v 15 If so, then we were also mistaken, because we obviously taught what was wrong about God. For we told that God made Christ alive. However— if it's really true that the dead will never be made alive again, then God never made Christ alive!
\v 16 For if it's true that dead people will never be made alive again, it means that Christ was never made alive again either.
\v 17 And if Christ wasn't made alive again after death, our faith is just useless, and we're still living in sin!
\v 18 It's the same for our brothers and sisters who became one with Christ and have died. They weren't saved, but were destroyed!
\v 19 And if our hope in Christ is only for life in this world, we're the most unfortunate of all people.
\p
\v 20 But Christ actually was made alive from among the dead! That's what has become the guarantee that others who've died will definitely live again.\f + \fk become the gurantee … \ft Literally, “the first produce (of the harvest) of those who are asleep (in death).” Jesus is illustrated as the first produce of the harvest. In the Old Testament, the first produce of harvest was given to God. (Lev. 23:9-14) In this verse, the first produce of harvest is a guarantee that there will still be much more produce that will be harvested.\f*
\v 21 So pay attention to this: The power of death spread to mankind because of the act of one man— namely Adam. So now, because of One Man also— who is Jesus, mankind will be made alive again after death.
\v 22 Because as Adam's descendants, all people experience death. But each of us who are one with Christ will be made to live again after death.
\v 23 But the process of coming alive again happens in stages: First, Christ was made alive again as a guarantee for us. Then at His return, all of us who've become Christ's own will be made alive again from death.
\v 24 Then the last thing of all will happen— that's when Christ will destroy every other government, kingdom, and authority. After that, He'll hand over everything to God the Father, so that God rules as High King.
\p
\v 25 For God has determined for Christ to “sit at the right side” of God and rule as King until the time comes which God promised to Him— which is, “I will defeat everyone who opposes You and make them Your slaves.”\x + Ps. 110:1; Mat. 22:44; Acts 2:34-35; Heb. 1:13\x*
\v 26 The last enemy that will be destroyed is the power of death.
\v 27 For it's written in the Holy Bible, “God has put everything under His power.”\x + Ps. 8:6\x* In writing, “God has put everything under His power,” it's clear that God the Father Himself isn't included in this.
\v 28 But after everything is under the power of God's Son, then Christ Himself will show that He's also under the power of God the Father— that is Him who has put everything under the power of His Son. In that way, it'll be clear that God is the Almighty and the Most High.
\p
\v 29 And again concerning the resurrection of us believers from death: If it's really true that dead people won't be made alive again after death, why have there been some of our brothers and sisters in the faith who've asked to be baptized with water once more, to represent their fathers or mothers who've already died?\f + \fk baptized… who've already dead \ft Literally, “baptized for dead people.” It's quite likely that the meaning of this is to be baptized for a family member who died before having the opportunity to hear about Jesus. Family members of such people certainly thought like this, “Oh my! My father believed that the King of Salvation would come, so he certainly would've become a follower of Jesus if he'd had the opportunity.” Paul used this example, which had been done by the first Christians, as proof that those Christians really did believe in resurrection from death. But Paul did not mean for Christians in this age to do baptisms like that.\f* It's clear that those brothers and sisters of ours think that we as followers of Christ will also be made alive again after death. If not, why would they request to do something like that?
\v 30 And we apostles are another proof: If we believers won't be made alive again after death, why aren't we ever afraid to face danger every moment?
\v 31 It's true Brothers and Sisters, I'm prepared to die every moment! I swear it's true, and my feelings of pride about you are also true! I'm proud of you because you're the proof of my ministry under the guidance of our Lord Christ Jesus.
\v 32 Why was I willing to fight against very fierce people in Ephesus?! If we humans just die and aren't made live again, then it'll happen like this, “Let's satisfy ourselves with food and drink, because tomorrow we'll die.”\x + Isa. 22:13; 56:12.\x*
\v 33 But don't be deceived by people who talk like that, because there's a proverb, “If you associate with evil people, you'll become like them later on!”
\v 34 So, be truly aware now! And don't sin anymore! You should be ashamed, because it's clear that some of you don't know God.
\s What happens to our bodies when we're made alive again
\p
\v 35 But there's often the question, “How will dead people be made alive again? When we're made alive, what will our bodies be like then?”
\v 36 That's a stupid question. The seed of a plant that's planted first experiences death so that it can grow and live again.
\v 37 And if you plant a plant, what you plant isn't the whole plant that's still growing, but what's planted is its seed— like a grain of wheat or some other seed.
\v 38 After it's planted, God always gives a body to the seed according to what was determined by Him for each kind of seed.
\v 39 There are many kinds of plants, so there are differences between the bodies of people and the bodies of other living creatures too— such as animals, birds, and fish.
\v 40 In the same way, objects on the earth are different than objects in the sky, and the beauty of objects in the sky is different than the beauty of objects on the earth.
\v 41 The beauty of the sun is different than the beauty of the moon. And every star's beautiful radiance is different.
\p
\v 42 Similarly also there will be a transformation in our bodies when we are made alive again! Our bodies that are buried will decay like a seed that's planted, but the bodies which will be given to us when we're made alive again can't decay anymore!
\v 43 When our bodies are buried— like when a grain of wheat is planted, they look lowly and weak. But when made alive again, they become heavenly bodies that are glorious and have power!
\v 44 The body that's illustrated as a seed that's 'planted', is the physical body. But what's made alive again is the spiritual body.
\p If there's a physical body, it certainly means there has be a spiritual body too.
\v 45 As it's written in the Holy Bible, “The first human— who was Adam, became a living being.” But the Person who's like the last Adam—\f + \fk Adam \ft The name Adam means 'human'. Here “the last Adam” points to Christ, the 'Heavenly Human'.\f* who is Christ, is a Spirit who gives life.\x + Gen. 2:7.\x*
\v 46 From that example, we can see that what came first was the physical being, and then the spiritual being.
\v 47 The first human— who was Adam, was created from the dust of the earth, whereas He who's illustrated as the second Adam— who is Christ, comes from heaven.
\v 48 In the same way, we earthly humans have an earthly body like Adam. And everyone who becomes a citizen of the kingdom of heaven is given a body like the body of Him who came from heaven.
\v 49 We live now according to the image of the first human who came from the dust of the earth. In the same way, we'll be changed later on to become new humans, according to the image of Him who came from heaven.
\p
\v 50 Brothers and Sisters, this is important to understand: Our physical bodies, which consist of flesh and blood, can't become citizens of God's kingdom. These bodies of ours, which are headed toward death, can't enter the eternal place.
\v 51 Take note! Because now I want to reveal a secret to you: Not all of us will die, but we'll each be changed!
\v 52 That will happen in a brief moment, in just a blink of the eye, and we'll all be changed. And that will happen when the sound of the last trumpet is heard. At that moment, all those who fully believed who have died will be made alive again with new bodies— that is bodies that can never experience death again, and each of us who are still alive when that happens will be changed immediately to become like them.
\v 53 The change that we'll experience later on can be illustrated like when we change clothes. For the body that can die will be replaced with a body that can't die.
\v 54 So when our bodies that can die are replaced with bodies that can't die, this word that's written will be fulfilled:
\q1 “The power of death has been defeated, and we've won!”\x + Is. 25:8\x*
\q1
\v 55 “O death, we aren't afraid of you anymore!
\q2 O death, you don't have the power to hurt us anymore!”\x + Hos. 13:14\x*
\m
\v 56 The power of death to hurt comes from sin. And the Law is often the motivator so that humans become slaves to the power of sin.\f + \fk the Law… power of sin \ft Paul explains his purpose for this sentence in Rom. 5:13 and Rom. 7:7-25.\f*
\v 57 But we thank God, because through our Lord Christ Jesus, we've been given the victory!
\p
\v 58 For that reason, my beloved Brothers and Sisters, stand firm! Nothing should be allowed to shake your certainty! Give yourselves fully to the work of serving the Lord, because we know— with the Lord's leading, whatever we do will never be worthless.
