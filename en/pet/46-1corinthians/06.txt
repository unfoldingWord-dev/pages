\s Overcoming problems between fellow brothers in the faith
\p
\v 1 I really don't approve when lawsuits happen between you, and some of you dare to bring those cases to a judge who doesn't believe in God! Why don't you ask one of the brothers in the faith to resolve the cases that happen among you? That would be much better, because a brother in the faith has been purified by Christ, whereas judges from outside the church aren't yet.
\v 2 Don't you know that God's people are the ones who'll judge this world? So, if you'll judge this world, you can surely resolve small cases.
\v 3 We will even judge angels! If that's so, we can resolve ordinary lawsuits in this life, for sure.
\v 4 So, if you have a case like that which needs to be tried, why do you bring it to a judge who isn't included in the brothers in the faith? That's stupid!
\v 5 You should feel ashamed! Isn't there even one person among you who's wise enough to judge cases which happen between brothers of the faith?!
\v 6 But now, there's a brother in the faith who's bringing another brother in the faith to court— in fact, that trial is conducted before people who don't believe in Christ!
\p
\v 7 The fact that you have lawsuts among you shows clearly that you are already in wrong wrong. Rather than pursuing the case, it would be better to let your brother in the faith do you wrong, or cause you loss.
\v 8 But in fact, you yourselves are involved in things that aren't just and cause loss to people— even to brothers in the faith!
\p
\v 9-10 Don't forget that evil people won't become citizens of God's kingdom! Don't be deceived! Those who won't enter God's kingdom are:
\q people who are immoral, worshipers of idols,
\q those who commit adultery, those who do all kinds of homosexual acts,
\q greedy people, thieves,
\q drunkards, slanderers, and swindlers.
\m
\v 11 And of course, there were those of you who used to live like that! But now you've been cleansed, made holy and made right before God by becoming one with our Lord Christ Jesus and with the Spirit of our God.
\s Use your body for the glory of God\x + Gen. 2:24\x*
\p
\v 12 Now, certainly there will be someone who says, “We followers of Christ are permitted to do anything and eat anything,” but I will answer that everything isn't useful. And I don't want to allow anything in my life to be the devil's tool to control me.
\v 13 For example, some say, “God gives food to fill the stomach, and the stomach was created to enjoy food.” I will answer that neither of them will enter heaven but will be destroyed by God. Because of that you must understand that our bodies weren't created by God for committing immorality, but were created for glorifying the Lord. And the Lord also cares about what we do to our bodies.
\v 14 And God, who showed His power when He brought the body of the Lord Jesus back to life after death, will also give us life after death. For that reason, we must be careful how we use our bodies!
\p
\v 15 Don't forget that each of our bodies are part of the body of Christ. Because of that, is it proper for a follower of Christ to take a member of the body of Christ— that is his own body, and unite it with the body of a prostitute? Certainly not!
\v 16 For God's Word says, “In marriage a man is united with his wife— so that the two become one.”\x + Gen. 2:24.\x* So you must know that if anyone has sex with a prostitute, he becomes one body with that prostitute.
\v 17 On the contrary, a person who surrenders himself to the Lord has become one with the Lord in spirit.
\p
\v 18 So don't ever do anything immoral. No other sin clings directly to the body of the person who commits that sin. But a person who commits the sin of immorality sins against his own body.
\v 19 Don't forget that each of our bodies is like the Most Holy Room for God's Spirit— which is His Spirit that we've received from God, and lives in each of us! It means that our bodies aren't our own possessions anymore.
\v 20 For we were bought back with a very high price— which is the blood of Christ. For that reason, let's glorify God with our bodies.
