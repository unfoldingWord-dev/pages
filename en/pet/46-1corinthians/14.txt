\s Regarding the special abilities God's Spirit gives to strengthen the church
\p
\v 1 For that reason, let's always make love the priority, then really try to receive the special abilities which are given by God's Spirit— first and foremost the ability to prophesy.
\v 2 I say this because people who have the special ability to speak in languages of the Spirit don't usually communicate anything that can be understood by other people. Through God's Spirit they speak to God alone about things that can only be understood by God.
\v 3 Whereas people who prophesy speak to other people in order to encourage them, give motivation, and comfort them.
\v 4 People who speak in different languages of the Spirit usually only encourage themselves, whereas a person who prophesies can encourage the whole church.
\p
\v 5 I long for each of you to have the special ability to speak in languages of the Spirit. But what I long for more than that is that you prophesy. The person who prophesies is more important than the person who just speaks in a language of the Spirit. But the ability of languages of the Spirit is valued the same as prophecy if a member of the church has the spiritual ability to translate the language of the Spirit, so that the church can be encouraged through what's communicated.
\p
\v 6 Brothers and Sisters, it's useless for me to come to you if I only speak in a language of the Spirit that you don't understand. I can only help you if I give revelation or knowledge from God, or prophesy, or teach in a language that you understand.
\v 7 That can be illustrated by a musical instrument— like a flute or guitar. Even though the instrument isn't like a living person, yet if it's played in a careless way, then the person listening can't recognize the song that's being played.
\v 8 In the same way, if the soldier whose duty is to play the trumpet doesn't know how to blow clearly, then other soldiers won't understand that the sound of his trumpet is the command to prepare for battle.
\v 9 So it's the same with you who speak in languages of the Spirit. If your words can't be understood, how can your words be useful to the listeners? It's as if you're speaking to the wind alone.
\p
\v 10 Of course there are many, many languages in the world, and every language is used to communicate meaningful messages to speakers of that language.
\v 11 But if I don't understand someone's language, then I'm a foreigner to him, and I consider him a foreigner too.
\v 12 It's the same with you too. You really long for the special abilities from God's Spirit. So sincerely ask God that you be given the abilities that can encourage the church.
\p
\v 13 So for the person who has the special ability to speak in a language of the Spirit, he should pray that he's also given the ability to interpret what he communicates in that language of the Spirit.
\v 14 When I pray in a language of the Spirit, it's just my spirit that prays, while my mind is silent.
\v 15 So I've decided to do this: When I pray, I will involve my spirit and my mind. And when I sing praises, I will involve my spirit and my mind.
\v 16 For if you praise God in your spirit, using a language of the Spirit only, how can the listener who doesn't understand join in praising God, or say “Amen” to your expression of thanks?
\v 17 Even though you thank God in a very good way, yet other people who hear can't be encouraged by that Spiritual language.
\p
\v 18 I thank God because I speak in different languages of the Spirit more often\f + \fk more often \ft Can also be translated ‘more’— with the meaning that Paul had more languages of the Spirit.\f* than you.
\v 19 But in church meetings, instead of expressing thousands of words in a language of the Spirit, it would be better that I speak five words that can be understood— so that the listeners are encouraged by my teaching.
\p
\v 20 Brothers and Sisters, don't think like little children do in this matter. But concerning evil— yes, become like babies! But in your thinking about this matter, you should be adults!
\v 21 Concerning the special ability of Spiritual languages, it can be read in the Lord's Word,\f + \fk Lord's Word\ft Literally, “the Law.” In the Greek language, that word is also used in a broader meaning for the whole Old Testament.\f*
\b
\q1 “By using people who oppose them, who speak in other languages—
\q2 that is foreign tribes,
\q1 I will speak to these hard-headed people of Israel,
\q2 but they still won't listen to Me.”\x + Is. 28:11-12\x*
\b
\m That's the word of the Lord.
\v 22 And from those words we can see that using a language of the Spirit is more appropriate for people who are hard-headed and don't want to believe completely in the Lord— not for those who completely believe. Whereas prophecy is very useful for people who already believe completely, and not as appropriate for those who don't yet believe.
\v 23 Even so, if there are some people who've just entered a church meeting when you're all speaking in different languages of the Spirit, they'll think you're crazy of course.
\v 24 But if you're all prophesying and a person who doesn't yet believe or understand enters your meeting, then your prophecies will reveal his sins to him, and he'll feel judged by everything you say.
\v 25 And the secrets that are in his heart will be revealed. In the end, he'll kneel and worship God, while confessing, “God is really with you.”
\s Church meetings should be orderly in order to encourage each other
\p
\v 26 So Brothers and Sisters, here's the conclusion of all this: When you get together, each of you should be involved according to your special ability— either bringing a song, or teaching, or giving a revelation from God, or speaking in a language of the Spirit, or interpreting what's communicated in a language of the Spirit. The goal of all of this has to be to encourage one another.
\v 27 If there are some who are ready to speak in a language of the Spirit, then only two, or at most three people can be allowed. They should speak one by one, and there must be someone of those present who can translate what they communicate.
\v 28 If no one has the special ability to translate, then they aren't allowed to speak in languages of the Spirit in that meeting. Let them use that ability just to speak to themselves and to God.
\p
\v 29 Regarding people with the special ability to prophesy, only two or three of them may speak in one meeting. And the other brothers and sisters should also evaluate what they say.
\v 30 But if God reveals something to one of those present, then the person who's speaking must be quiet— so that God's message may be communicated in an orderly way.
\v 31 In that way, all of you who have the special ability to prophesy have the opportunity one by one, so that everyone present can get teaching and be encouraged.
\v 32 For everyone who has the ability to prophesy is able to control himself and wait patiently for the time they can communicate a message from God.
\v 33 For God doesn't want confusion, but everything we do based on His leadership will always proceed calmly.
\p According to what's done in all the worship services of God's people,
\v 34 it's best for women to keep quiet in the worship service. Women aren't allowed to speak directly, because they have to keep respecting and obeying the leadership of their own husbands— like it says in the Law.
\v 35 If a woman wants to ask something, she should ask her husband at home, because it's best for a woman not to talk in the worship service.
\p
\v 36 If some of you aren't happy with my teaching, remember that it wasn't you who received the teaching from God first, and you aren't the only ones who became followers of Christ! You should also follow the custom of the churches in other places.
\v 37 If one of you feels that he has the special ability to prophesy, or is filled with God's Spirit, let him also acknowledge that what I've written is the Lord's command.
\v 38 And if that person doesn't acknowledge this teaching, it means he doesn't have the ability to prophesy— and isn't even filled by God's Spirit!
\p
\v 39 So Brothers and Sisters, ask the Lord sincerely that each of you be given the special ability to prophesy. And don't forbid another brother in the faith to use his special ability to speak in a language of the Spirit.
\v 40 But everything must be done in a good and orderly way.
