\c 11
\p
\v 1 So follow my example, just as I also follow Christ's example.
\s Some instructions for men and women in worship together
\p
\v 2 I'm very pleased that you always remember me, and also keep following all of the teachings that I've given you!
\v 3 But now I want to tell you this: The head over Christ is God. And the head over every man is Christ, and the head over every wife is her husband.
\p
\v 4 So if a man prophesies or prays using a cloth head covering, it shows he doesn't respect Christ as his Head.
\v 5 On the contrary, when a woman prays or prophesies, she must use a cloth head covering. If not, it means that she doesn't respect and obey her husband as her head. For it isn't proper for a woman to pray or prophesy without a head covering. That's shameful, just like if a woman has her head shaved bald.
\v 6 If a woman doesn't want to use a head covering, let her cut her hair short like a man's hair! But if she feels ashamed to be seen with short hair like a man's, or even shaved, then she should wear a head covering.
\p
\v 7 But of course a man doesn't need to wear a cloth head covering when praying or prophesying, because the man was created according to God's image, and shows the glory of God. Whereas a woman shows the glory of man.
\v 8 For the man didn't come from a woman, but it was the woman who came from a man.
\v 9 And also the first man— who was Adam, wasn't created to help the woman, but the first woman— who was Eve, was created to help the man.
\v 10 For that reason, a woman needs to wear a head covering to show that she respects and obeys her head— who is her husband. And this is also done to remember that angels are always present in our worship service.
\p
\v 11-12 But we need to remember— even though in the beginning the woman came from a man, yet after that, every man was born of a woman. Both men and women come from God. And each of us who are one with the Lord Jesus are aware that men and women both need each other.
\p
\v 13 Think carefully about this: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God in a church meeting without using a cloth head covering?!
\v 14 On the contrary, everyone knows that it isn't proper for a man to have long hair like a woman.
\v 15 However, long hair is the pride of women, because long hair was given by God to women especially, as a sign that each woman is under the leadership of her husband.\f + \fr 11:15 \fk as a sign … \ft Paul literally wrote “as protection.” The protection here isn't the same as the word Paul used for “head covering” in verses 4-7. And verse 6 shows that a woman can't consider that long hair is a replacement for a head covering. Even so, it's interpreted that there is a similarity between the head covering and long hair in the Jewish culture of Paul's day— which is that both are signs that the status of women in the church, and in daily life, is under the leadership of men. If a woman doesn't have a husband yet, she's under the leadership of her father.\f*
\v 16 But regarding this teaching, if there's anyone who insists on changing this custom, you should know that we— the apostles, teach only this, and the churches of God don't have a different custom.
\s The Lord's Supper
\p
\v 17 In the following matter, I can't praise you. For your meetings don't produce good things, but bad things.
\v 18 For first of all, I hear that when you get together, there are still divisions among you. And I think that news is true.
\v 19 How sad! Maybe there are those who feel that there must be divisions among you so that it's clear which of your groups is right!
\v 20 So, I hear that when you get together, the supper that you celebrate obviously isn't worth being called the “Lord's Supper.”
\v 21 For when you eat together before the Lord's Supper, everyone takes his own food without waiting for others. In the end, there are members who don't get a share and are hungry, while others are full, and then drink until drunk.
\v 22 You who are greedy for food and drink, don't do that in a church meeting! Eat first at your own homes, because you're insulting God's church with that behavior of yours, and humiliating our poor members! So what else can I tell you?! I certainly can't praise you for this!
\p
\v 23 For the teaching that I gave you is the same as I received from the Lord Himself: That is, on the night when the Lord Jesus was turned over to His enemies, He took bread
\v 24 and gave thanks to God for the bread. Then He tore the bread and said, “This is My body which is sacrificed for you. Do this to remember Me.”
\v 25 In the same way, after eating, Jesus took a cup filled with wine. And He said, “This blood of Mine illustrates that the new promise between God and man is legally validated. Do this to remember Me, when you drink wine like this.”
\v 26 So in agreement with what the Lord said, every time we eat bread and drink wine like this before He returns, it means that we're telling about the Lord's death again.
\p
\v 27 So if during the Lord's Supper someone eats bread and drinks wine in a way that doesn't fear and respect the Lord, then that person has sinned against the body and blood of the Lord.
\v 28-29 That's why everyone should examine himself before he eats the bread and drinks the wine of the supper, to make sure that he's aware of that meaning of the bread and wine. For if anyone eats the bread and drinks the wine without being aware of its meaning, he's bringing punishment on himself.
\v 30 And that's the reason why many of you are frequently sick and weak, and there are also those who've died!
\p
\v 31 But if we examine ourselves and are aware of the meaning of that supper, then we don't need to be afraid of the Lord's punishment anymore.
\v 32 Even if God punishes us, it's to discipline us— so that we won't be destroyed with the evil people who are in this world.
\p
\v 33 For that reason, Brothers and Sisters, when you get together for the Lord's Supper, be patient and wait for each other while taking turns, so that you celebrate it in a proper and orderly way.
\v 34 If someone is hungry, it would be best for him to eat at his home first, so that the celebration together doesn't become an opportunity for him to bring punishment on himself. And regarding your other questions, I'll teach that to you when I come.
