\s News about Christ Jesus who was crucified
\p
\v 1 In the same way, Brothers and Sisters, when I told the news of salvation among you the first time— which is God's teaching that was kept secret from people earlier, I didn't use beautiful words or worldly wisdom to teach it.
\v 2 For at that time I had decided that as long as I was with you, I would forget all other teaching except Christ Jesus and His death on the cross.
\v 3 And when I came, I was weak and trembling with fear.
\v 4 Even though my teaching and my words weren't wise words that could convince people, yet my teaching was strengthened by the Holy Spirit's power.
\v 5 And that's good, because in that way your faith is based on God's power alone— not on the wisdom of men.
\s God's Wisdom
\p
\v 6 But actually, when we're with people who are spiritually mature, we do teach wisdom. But our wisdom doesn't comes from this world, and it also isn't from the authorities of this world who will soon be destroyed.
\v 7 We teach God's wisdom, which was hidden from people in the past, since the creation of the world. But now God has revealed that wisdom to us, so that we can share in enjoying His glory.
\v 8 Before this, the authorities and kings of this world never understood that wisdom. If they had understood, they wouldn't have crucified Jesus— our glorious Lord.
\v 9 But that is what this verse from Holy Bible means,
\q1 “No human has ever seen,
\q2 heard, or even imagined
\q2 what God has prepared for the people who love Him.”\x + Is. 64:4\x*
\m
\v 10 But now God has shown those things to us through His Spirit! For the Holy Spirit knows everything— even God's secrets that are truly hidden.
\v 11 For example, no one knows another person's thoughts, except the spirit that lives in him. It's the same with God: No one knows God's thoughts, except God's own Spirit.
\v 12 And we haven't received a spirit that comes from this world, but now we've received God's own Spirit! So with His Spirit's, help we've been given ability to understand the things which God has given us because of His kindness.
\p
\v 13 So when we teach those spiritual things, we don't tell them by using words taught by human wisdom. Rather, we use words that have been given to us by the Holy Spirit. In that way, the words of wisdom from the Holy Spirit are used to explain spiritual ideas.
\v 14 But a person who doesn't live with God's Spirit can't receive the teaching that comes from God's Spirit, because a person like that will think that teaching is something stupid. He can't possibly understand, because the teaching from God's Spirit can only be understood with the help of God's Spirit.
\v 15 That's why we who are one with God's Spirit can evaluate all the deep spiritual teachings, whereas outsiders aren't able to evaluate anything about us. This agrees with God's Word that says,
\q1
\v 16 “Humans cannot possibly know the Lord's thoughts!
\q2 No one is able to give advice to Him.”\x + Is. 40:13\x*
\m For that reason, it's very amazing that we, through His Spirit, are now given the ability to think like Christ!
