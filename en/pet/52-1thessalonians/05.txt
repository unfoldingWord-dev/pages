\c 5
\p
\s Be ready to welcome the return of the Lord
\v 1 But Brothers and Sisters, we don't need to explain more to you in this letter regarding the time and moment when that will happen.
\v 2 For you already know clearly that the day of the Lord's return will come in a sudden way, like a thief who comes in the night.
\v 3 At that time, there will certainly be people who say, “Everything is peaceful and orderly”— but at that very moment they will suddenly perish, and no one can run away. Everyone will suddenly realize the danger— like a woman who suddenly experiences pain when she's going to give birth.
\p
\v 4 But Brothers and Sisters, we don't live in the darkness. So that day won't take us by surprise, like when a thief comes.
\v 5 For we've all become children of the light, and our lives are enlightened by the Lord. We aren't children of the darkness, who walk in the dark night.
\v 6 So let's not be like other people who aren't aware— like those who are sleeping. But we should keep on guard and control ourselves.
\v 7 For people who live unaware can be illustrated by people who are sleeping soundly at night, and also like people who are drunk at night.
\v 8 But we're children of the light, so we should control ourselves. For we're fighting against the devil. And we should use the weapons of war that we have. May our faith in Jesus, and our love for the brothers and sisters in the faith, be like an iron vest which protects our hearts. And let our confidence of being saved be like a war helmet.
\p
\v 9 For as people chosen by God, we weren't chosen to be punished according to His wrath, but He chose us to be saved through our Lord Christ Jesus.
\v 10 Jesus has died for us. For that reason He's the one who guarantees us that whether we've already died or are still live when He returns, we'll live with Him.
\v 11 So you should continue to urge each other, and encourage each other's hearts with this teaching, just like you're doing now.
\s Final instructions and greetings
\p
\v 12 Brothers and Sisters, we ask each of you to appreciate the Lord's servants among you— who work to lead and advise you with much difficulty.
\v 13 Honor and love them sincerely, because you remember everything they do for the church.
\p
\q Live in peace with each other
\q
\v 14 We also urge you, Brothers and Sisters, to rebuke the members of the church who are lazy about working.
\q Encourage the hearts of the brothers and sisters who are afraid to follow Jesus.
\q Help those who are weak.
\q Be patient with everyone.
\q
\v 15 Pay attention so that none of our members repay evil with evil. But always try to do good to the brothers and sisters in the faith and to everyone.
\p
\q
\v 16 Be joyful always.
\q
\v 17 Keep on praying.
\q
\v 18 Be thankful to God in every situation, because that's what God wants for us to do as people who are one with Christ Jesus.
\p
\v 19 Don't extinguish the fire of the Holy Spirit, who works in each of you.
\v 20 For example, when a member of the church prophesies, don't consider the news that he has delivered to be insignificant.
\v 21 But you should test every prophecy first before you receive it. If the message of the prophecy turns out to be from the Lord's Spirit, then receive it.
\v 22 Don't get involved in any kind of evil.
\v 23 Now we entrust you to God— that is to Him who always gives calmness in His protection. Our prayer is that He purify each of you more and more until you're perfect, so that your whole life remains without fault in the eyes of the Lord— including your spirit, thoughts, and deeds, until the moment our Lord Christ Jesus returns.
\v 24 For God is the one who calls each of you, and He can be trusted! He's the one who'll complete all of that in you!
\p
\v 25 Brothers and Sisters, pray for us.
\p
\v 26 As people who are purified by God, give greetings full of love\f + \fr 5:26 \fk purified … greetings full of love \ft Literally, “with a holy kiss.”\f* to each of the brothers and sisters in the faith who are there.
\p
\v 27 For the sake of our oneness with the Lord, I remind you to read this letter to all the other brothers and sisters in the faith.
\p
\v 28 My prayer is that the kindness of our Lord Christ Jesus will be with you always.
