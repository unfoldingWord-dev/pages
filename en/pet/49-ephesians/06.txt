\s Advice to children and parents
\p
\v 1 Children, obey your parents. If you've become the Lord's follower, you should obey them.
\v 2 Remember the Lord's command: “Honor your father and mother.” That command is the first one to be accompanied with a promise from God,
\v 3 which is, “Honor them so that you'll obtain kindness and a long life in this world.”\x + Ex. 20:12; Deut. 5:16\x*
\p
\v 4 To every fathers, don't make your children bitter, but raise them with instruction and advice according to the Lord's will.
\s Advice to slaves and masters
\p
\v 5 And to everyone who sold as a slave to his master:\f + \fr 6:5 \fk slave to his master \ft Slaves were people who were sold to another person. Based on the decision of a judge, a person who had a huge debt could be punished by becoming a slave in exchange for his debt. Or a father who really needed funds could sell his child as a slave. Or residents of a land defeated in war by another land were sold as slaves to people in the other land. A slave had to work for his master. He didn't have any rights at all, didn't receive wages, and couldn't get out of being a slave. If he ran away from slavery and was captured, a slave was often sentenced to die. The life of a slave was in the hands of his master. If his master was a friendly, honest, and rich, then the living situation of his slaves could be rather good. But many masters weren't like that. In New Testament times, there were also several different kinds of slavery, which weren't the same as what we now call ‘servants’ or ‘workers’, or ‘helpers’ in Indonesia.\f* Obey your masters in this world with feelings of fear and full respect. And do it with all your heart— just like you obey Christ.
\v 6 Always do what they want— whether they're present or not. Don't just pretend to work. Because Christ is really your Master! So you should serve your earthly masters wholeheartedly and according to the will of the Lord.
\v 7 Do your duties gladly, because you're actually serving the Lord— not man.
\v 8 And remember that the Lord will give a reward to everyone who does good— both to those living as slaves, or free men.
\p
\v 9 The same is true for each master: You should treat your slaves well. Don't make them afraid by always threatening them. Remember that both you and they have the same Lord in heaven, who judges everyone impartially.
\s Wear all of the battle equipment that is given by God
\p
\v 10 As final instructions, you should each become strong because you keep on hoping completely in the Lord's amazing power, and also because you have become one with Him.
\v 11 Just like a soldier wears his equipment for war, you must wear all the battle equipment that God gives us. In that way you can reject the devil's lies.
\v 12 For we aren't fighting against people on this earth. But we fight against evil spirits and all the powers who rule those evil spirits. They're the ones who now control this dark world from the sky above.
\v 13 That's why you need to use all the tools of war from God, so that when the enemy comes to attack you, you won't run, but can oppose him and keep enduring until the war is over.
\p
\v 14 So stand firm. Hold on to the true teaching from God, because true teaching is like a belt that makes you ready to act. Live a righteous life, because a righteous life is like a metal vest that will protect you from the enemy's attacks.
\v 15 And keep holding on to the Good News about Christ. That news helps you to feel calm in the protection of God. Continually hold on to that news, just like a soldier always wears strong boots, so that you stand firm in war.
\v 16 Besides that, keep believing in the Lord. For your faith is like a shield that protects you from all of the flaming arrows that the devil shoots at us.
\v 17 Be sure that God has saved you, because that is like your war helmet. And hold onto all of God's words like holding a sword, because His words have the power of the Holy Spirit.
\v 18 Always pray in every situation. And hope completely in the Holy Spirit for everything you need. You should be alert for things that need to be prayed for. Don't give in! And keep praying for all of God's people.
\p
\v 19 And I hope you'll pray for me too. Pray that the Lord gives me wisdom so that I will speak boldly when I give the Good News that used to be kept secret.
\v 20 For I'm God's messenger to tell about His kingdom, even though at this moment I'm in prison and bound with chains. So pray that I can tell the news from God with boldness, according to my duty.
\s Final greetings
\p
\v 21-22 Our beloved brother, Tychicus, has brought this letter to you. He serves the Lord very faithfully as our brother who has become one with the Lord. I also sent him so that he could give you news about my situation and ministry, so that you can know about our situation and so that he can strengthen your hearts.
\p
\v 23 Brothers and Sisters, I pray that God our Father and our Lord Christ Jesus will watch over you so that you live calmly in the protection of the Lord, and He's the one who makes you always love each other and keep holding on to our faith.
\v 24 To all who love our Lord Christ Jesus with undying love, I pray that God will always be kind to you.
