\v 1 Dear Brothers and Sisters in the faith [in the church at Ephesus]—\f + \fr 1:1 \fk in … Ephesus \ft These words aren't found in some ancient Greek language manuscripts.\f* that is to you who fully believe in Christ Jesus and arepurified by Him: Greetings from Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus, who became an apostle by the will of God.
\p
\v 2 My prayer is that God the Father and our Lord Christ Jesus will always be kind to each of you and watch over you so that you live calmly under our Father's and our Lord's protection!
\s Spiritual blessings in Christ Jesus
\p
\v 3 Praise to God— who's the Father of our Lord Christ Jesus. For because we've become one with Christ, God has given us every spiritual blessing which is in heaven.
\v 4 For God chose us before the world was created. That means He already loved us, and planned that we would be made pure and without blame before Him because of becoming one with Christ.
\v 5 Before this world was created, God had already determined to adopt us as His children\f + \fr 1:5 \fk adopt us as His children \ft See the footnotes at Gal. 4:5 and Eph. 1:11.\f* through Christ Jesus, according to His will. That was pleasing to Him.
\v 6 So we praise God for His glorious kindness, which was freely given to us because we're one with His beloved Son.
\p
\v 7 Through oneness with Christ, we're redeemed by the sacrifice of His blood as payment for the punishment for sin that we should bear. That means we receive forgiveness of sin because of God's amazing kindness to us.
\v 8 His kindness was given to us in abundance, according to all the wisdom and understanding of God.
\v 9 So now the plan of God has been revealed to us— that is His plan which was kept secret from man in the past. According to His will, God's plan is centered in Christ,
\v 10 and it will be completed by Him at a time which God determines. And this is the purpose of His plan: Christ will become the head of all things— both those in heaven and those on earth.
\p
\v 11 Of course God arranges everything according to what He has determined and desired. And it happens that we've been chosen from the beginning of the world to inherit the rights as His people\f + \fr 1:11 \fk chosen … \ft This phrase translates one word in the Greek language, (“eklerothemen”) which means “chosen as heirs.” Eph. 1:5, 1:18, 3:6; Rom. 9:14-17; Gal. 3:18, 4:1-7.\f* through being one with Christ.
\v 12 So we're the first to become His people who hope in Christ! For that reason, let's praise God for His glory.
\v 13 In that way, when you heard the true teaching— which is the Good News about how God saved us, you believed in Christ. And because of that, God gave the Holy Spirit to you, which was promised by Him, as a sign that you're God's possession.
\v 14 His Spirit guarantees that we'll receive everything that God has promised to His people, and through His Spirit we know that the price of our redemption has been paid in full. So I say again, let's praise God for His glory!
\s Paul's prayer
\p
\v 15-16 Because of all of that, I always pray for you and thank God because of you. I haven't stopped doing that since I heard about your faith in the Lord Jesus, and your love for all God's people.
\v 17 In my prayer to God— who's the glorious Father of our Lord Christ Jesus, I request that God give you more wisdom and spiritual knowledge through the Holy Spirit. In that way, you'll know God more and more.
\p
\v 18 I also pray that God will make each of you able to understand and be certain of all the good things which He has already prepared for us— that is for us who were called to become His children. I also pray that you'll know how rich and glorious is the inheritance which God has promised to us— who are His people that were purified by Him.
\v 19 And I pray that you'll know that His power is so very great for us who believe. That power is the awesome strength of God
\v 20 which He used to bring Christ back to life from the dead. And that power was also seen when He placed Christ in the most honored place next to Him in heaven— which is at His right hand,
\v 21 where Christ rules as High King over all governments, leaders, powers and kings, including the authorities of this present age and that which will come.
\v 22 And God placed everything under the authority of Christ. God also made Him the head of the entire unified church of Christ, to lead us in all things.
\v 23 His unified church— which is a union made up of all of us who are filled with Christ's Spirit, is the body of Christ in this world. And through His body, Christ fills and equips everything everywhere more and more.
