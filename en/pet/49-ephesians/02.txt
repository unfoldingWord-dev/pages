\s From death to life
\p
\v 1 We were alive physically before this, of coursem yet we were actually already dead spiritually. That happened because of our sins, and because we continually broke the commands of God.
\v 2 For at that time, we were always following the evil ways of this world, and were also following the desires of the evil one— that is the devil, who's now ruling over all the powers of darkness in this world.\f + \fr 2:2 \fk the powers of darkness \ft Literally, “the powers of the air” or “the powers in the heavens.”\f* He's the authority in the lives of everyone who doesn't want to obey God.
\v 3 All of us used to live like that too— always trying to satisfy the desires that come from our bodies. And we were carried here and there by the current of our own desires. We also deserved to bear the anger of God, just like other people.
\p
\v 4 But God had compassion on us in a truly amazing way, and He really loves us!
\v 5 So while we were still spiritually dead and continually opposing His commands, God gave us new life. That happened because we were one with Christ, and spiritually we were made to live again with Him when God brought Him back to life from death. So it's clear that we've been saved only because of God's kindness!
\v 6 And because we're one with Christ Jesus, we've also been spiritually raised up with Christ to heaven. In a spiritual way, we're already sitting there with our King Jesus.
\v 7 God did all of that so that in the age to come, He could prove to us that He's very kind to us. His kindness to us who are one with Christ Jesus is really very amazing!
\p
\v 8 I mean that we're saved because of God's kindness. And we receive that salvation only because we fully believe in Christ. We can't be saved because of our own efforts. It's God's gift.
\v 9 So we aren't saved because we do good deeds. God has arranged this, of course, so that there isn't anyone who can brag about his salvation.
\v 10 Our salvation is the result of God's work alone. We who are one with Christ Jesus are created to become new people. And in that way, we're enabled to do the good things which God had planned for us to do from the beginning.
\s One in Christ
\p
\v 11 I want to remind each of you who aren't Jewish about your situation before knowing Christ. You were called “people who aren't circumcised” by the Jewish people, of course, because they call themselves “circumcised people.” They're proud because they follow the tradition of circumcision, even though it's just a sign made by human hands only on the bodies of men. It can't change your life.
\v 12 Before you knew Christ, you had no hope of becoming citizens of God's kingdom— who are now spiritually the people of the new Israel. And you had no part at all in God's promises to His people. So you lived in this world without hope and without knowing God.
\v 13 But even though you used to be very far from Him, you've now been brought close to Him. For now you're one with Christ Jesus, and have been made pure through the sacrifice of Christ's blood.
\p
\v 14 It's only because of Christ that we can all be at peace with God, and that applies both to Jews and to non-Jews. In our state of being made one with Christ when He was crucified, we also have been made one as the people of God. So Christ Himself has broken down the wall of opposition that has divided us until now.
\v 15 When that peace was made, Christ cancelled the Law and all of its commands, along with the rules of the law. That means that everyone, from every people group— if each of them is one with Christ, are as if created to become a new people group, and a peaceful nation.
\v 16 So through His sacrifice on the cross, Christ ended the opposition between Jewish people and non-Jewish people. And we all became like one body— in which each part of the body is at peace with God.
\v 17 And Christ has come and proclaimed peace, both to you who aren't Jewish— that is all the people groups which used to be far from God, and to us who are Jewish— the people group that used to be closer to God.
\v 18 Now all of us— through what Christ did for us, have the right to come to the Father through the Holy Spirit who's in each of us.
\p
\v 19 So you who aren't Jewish are no longer considered to be foreigners who don't have any rights at all. But now you are included in the people who have been made pure by God, citizens of God's kingdom, and members of God's family.
\v 20 All of us have become like a house which is built on large foundation stones— that symbolize all the prophets and apostles. And the most important foundation stone\f + \fr 2:20 \fk the most important foundation stone \ft Literally, “corner stone.”\f* is Christ Jesus Himself.
\v 21 When each of us becomes one with Christ, the whole building becomes larger until it becomes a holy Temple for God.
\v 22 So we, who come from any people group at all, are being built together by Christ to become a dwelling place for God through the Holy Spirit.
