\c 5
\p
\v 1 So since you are God's children, whom He loves, live right and clean from all wrong— like God Himself.
\v 2 May you all love each other, according to Christ's example. For He loved us to the point that He gave Himself as a sacrifice for us. His offering was very fragrant and pleased God.
\p
\v 3 Don't let there be any immorality, wickedness, or greed among you. Those things aren't at all appropriate for God's people.
\v 4 And among you there must not be those who speak evil, dirty or useless words. That isn't proper any longer for you. But you should be thankful.
\v 5 You should know this: People who commit sins of immorality, evil or greed, won't become citizens of the kingdom of Christ and God. People who are greedy are just like those who worship idols, because money has become their lord.
\p
\v 6 Don't join in being deceived by misleading teaching! It's precisely because people commit those sins that the wrath of God will fall on all those who don't obey.
\v 7 Because of that, don't join in committing those sins like they do.
\v 8 For in the past, you lived in darkness, but now you've entered into the light of the Lord. So live as citizens of the Kingdom of Light.
\v 9 For living in the light of God always produces all kinds of good deeds, a life that's right, and follows right teaching.
\v 10 So try to find the things that please the Lord.
\v 11 Don't continue to do what's done by those who still live in darkness. All of that is useless. Instead, you should each live and speak in a way that reveals that living in the darkness is wrong.
\v 12 For the things that they do in a dark and secret way are too shameful to even talk about.
\v 13 But when their dark deeds are shown in the light, all of their deeds are obviously wrong.
\v 14 For evil deeds will become visible when there's light. That's why this proverb is often quoted,
\q1 “Wake up, you who are sleeping.
\q2 Rise up from among the dead,
\q2 and Christ will shine on you.”
\p
\v 15 So be careful how you each live. Don't live like stupid people, but live like wise people.
\v 16 By that I mean that you use every opportunity to do what's good, because this age is an evil age.
\v 17 So don't live carelessly, but try to understand what the Lord wants you to do.
\v 18 Don't let your lives be controlled by wine which makes you drunk, because that can destroy you. Instead your life should be controlled by God's Spirit.
\v 19 Motivate each other by singing all kinds of praise songs to the Lord— including songs from the Book of Psalms or from God's Word and other spiritual songs. You should always sing with hearts that are happy to praise the Lord.
\v 20 And in every situation, always give thanks to God the Father because we have become one with our Lord Christ Jesus.
\s Advice to husbands and wives
\p
\v 21 You should be humble and ready to respect each other's desires.\f + \fr 5:21 \fk humble … each other's \ft These words translate a single word in the Greek language which is also translated as “obey the will” in verses 22 and 24.\f* Do this because you honor Christ.
\p
\v 22 Each wife, obey the will of your own husband, just like you obey the Lord's will.
\v 23 For the husband is the head of the wife, just like Christ is the head of the whole church of God. We're like the body of Christ that obeys the will of Christ, who has saved us as His body.
\v 24 So just as the whole church as the body of Christ obeys His will, so the wife must also obey the will of her husband in everything.\f + \fr 5:24 \fk obey … in everything \ft When Paul says this to wives, he doesn't mean that the wife has to do things that are contrary to the Lord's Word if ordered to do so by her husband. We still must obey God more than man.\f*
\p
\v 25 Hey husband, you should love your wife just like Christ has loved us— even to the point of offering Himself as a sacrifice for the whole church,
\v 26 so that we might be made pure and become His special possessions. We've also been purified through God's Word, which Jesus taught. God's Word is like pure water that cleanses us.\f + \fr 5:26 \fk Verse 26 \ft In a Jewish wedding ceremony, the bride was given a bath before dressing in the bridal gown and being presented to the groom. The words ‘water‘ and ‘cleanse’ are also interpreted as an analogy for baptism. So this verse can be translated, “so that we might purified and become His special possession. We were also cleansed and purified according to Christ's Word when we were baptized with water.”\f*
\v 27 That is why Christ died for us: So that we in His unified church are made special for Him alone, just like a groom takes a bride to be his wife. By that I mean that we're cleansed and glorified in a special way, to live continually with Him— without sin, guilt, or any stain at all.
\v 28 So in that way, each husband has to love his wife just like he loves his own body. For when a husband loves his wife, that is the same as loving himself.
\v 29 No one has ever hated his own body. Everyone feeds and cares for his body. And that's what Christ always does for His church,
\v 30 for we are parts of His body.
\v 31 That agrees with what's written in the Holy Bible, “In marriage, a man always leaves his father and mother and is united with his wife— so that the two of them become one.”\x + Gen.2:24\x*
\v 32 The teaching that I've just revealed is very deep. My point is that one of the meanings of that verse is about Christ and the unity of all His churches.
\v 33 So in conclusion: Every husband must love his wife just as he loves himself, and the wife must obey her husband.
