\c 3
\s Paul is an apostle for non-Jewish people
\p
\v 1 So I, Paul, am now in prison because of my service for Christ Jesus— especially for what I do to help you who aren't Jewish.
\v 2 Of course you've heard about the task given to me to tell you the news about God's kindness.
\v 3 That also includes the news which was given directly to me when God told me His secret plan— like what I have briefly written in this letter.
\v 4 By reading this, you can understand what I already understand about the plan that God had kept secret from people in the past— which is the secret about Christ.
\v 5 People who lived in former times were never told about that. But now God, through His Spirit, has revealed that secret to the messengers whom He has made pure— which are the apostles and people who've received the ability to prophesy.
\v 6 And this is that secret: Everyone who believes in the Good News about Christ Jesus— whether Jews or non-Jews, will inherit God's kingdom together. These two become like parts of one body, and together receive everything that God has promised to His people.
\p
\v 7 Through the power and kindness of God to me, I've become His servant, who was given the task to tell that Good News.
\v 8 That's truly amazing, because among the people who have been purified by God, I'm the very lowliest. But He gave that task to me only because of His kindness. And my task is to tell non-Jewish people about the many spiritual blessings that we receive abundantly through Christ. The abundance of His blessings is too amazing to be explained in human languages.
\v 9 And I was chosen to reveal this plan of God's to everyone. For this plan was kept hidden for many ages in the heart of God, the Creator of everything.
\v 10 God's will was that through us— that is His entire unified church, all authorities in every level of heaven and all other spiritual authorities could witness the many ways God shows His wisdom,
\v 11 which was His plan from the beginning, which He accomplished through Christ Jesus, our Lord.
\v 12 Because we who fully believe in Christ are one with Him, we feel free and no longer need to be afraid to come to God in prayer.
\v 13 So, I request that you not be disappointed and not lose heart because you hear about what I'm experiencing in this prison. Instead be proud because my suffering is for your sake.
\s Paul's prayer that the church in Ephesus may know Christ's love
\p
\v 14 For that reason, I kneel in prayer to the Father—
\v 15 that is to Him who became the Father of us all, both those who are on earth and those who are in heaven.
\v 16 I request, “Oh Father God, may Your name be glorified because You use Your unlimited power to strengthen every member of the church in Ephesus. Strengthen each of their hearts and spirits through your Spirit.”
\v 17 And I pray that through the faith you possess, Christ will live in each of you, and that you'll grow in the love which God has shown to us, and may that love become the foundation of your lives.
\v 18 For I want you and all of God's people to understand how broad, long, high, and deep Christ's love is for us.
\v 19 I pray like that even though Christ's love is too great for us to understand. But we try to understand His love, because in that way our lives are filled and equipped with God's own power.
\p
\v 20-21 May God— who's able to do far more than we can ask or think, always be glorified by the unity of His whole church. Glorify Him because of His amazing power which works in each of our lives. And because we're one with Christ Jesus,glorify God from age to age, forever! Amen!
