\s The oneness of the body of Christ
\p
\v 1 Therefore, as one imprisoned because of serving the Lord, I advise each of you to live according to your calling as the people of God.
\v 2 Continually be humble, gentle, and patient. Forgive each other, and love each other.
\v 3 We have been unified and live in peace with each other because we've all received the Holy Spirit. Because of that, keep trying to maintain that oneness.
\v 4 We've all become different parts of one body— which is the body of Christ, and we have the same Spirit of God, and God has called us to possess the same hope.
\v 5 We believe in the one and only Lord alone, and have the same faith, and we've all been baptized in the name of the same Lord.
\v 6 And for all of us, there's only one God and Father, who rules over everything, who's everywhere and in everything.
\p
\v 7 But Christ has given each of us special abilities, according to His kindness to us.
\v 8 That's why in the Holy Bible it is written,
\q1 “When He wins the battle, He'll ascend to the highest place,
\q2 He'll humiliate everyone who opposes Him, because they're captives of war forced to follow Him from behind.
\q2 Then He'll give different victory gifts to people who are on His side.”\x + Ps. 68:18\x*
\p
\v 9 Notice that this verse says, “He'll ascend.” This means that before that, Christ had descended to the lowest place on earth.
\v 10 And He who descended to that place has now also ascended to a place that is far higher than the sky. He did that so that the whole universe is filled with His presence.
\p
\v 11 So it's Christ who gives different special abilities to us: There are those who receive the ability to become apostles, and those who receive the ability to prophesy, or the ability to tell the Good News about Jesus, or the ability to become pastors, or the ability to teach God's people.
\v 12 All of those abilities were given so that we can prepare and equip the people of God, so that through the service of each of us, the body of Christ can be strengthened.
\v 13 That work must continue so that we all become more unified in faith and in our knowledge of God's Son. We should become more and more spiritually mature, and keep growing to become like Christ Himself.
\p
\v 14 So let's not be like children anymore, who are easily influenced and carried here and there by the currents of new teaching. For there are many false teachers who mislead with tricky teaching that's purposely made to look true.
\v 15 Instead, let's keep holding on to true teaching and always love each other. In that way, we'll grow to become more and more like Christ in all of His character. This means that as parts of the body of Christ we'll be more and more like Him who's our Head.
\v 16 He's the one who arranges that every member is ordered and unified with perfection, so that we're like a body which can move and grow because it has joints and all the other body parts. When each part functions properly, we're like a healthy body, because we encourage each other and love each other.
\s The right way to live
\p
\v 17 I'm warning you in the name of the Lord: Don't live like those who don't know God anymore. Their thinking is worthless,
\v 18 and their understanding is still darkened. They're very far from the way of life that God wants. That's because they don't know anything about God, and also because of their hardness of heart.
\v 19 They aren't ashamed. Because of that, they give themselves fully to do all kinds of evil things, and they're never satisfied.
\p
\v 20 But that isn't the way of life that you learned when you first came to know Christ!
\v 21 You've heard about Him, of course, and learned about becoming one with Him, according to true teaching that we received from Him.
\v 22 So each of you have been taught to leave the traits of your old life. That old life has to be thrown away like an old shirt. That old behavior was growing worse because we were led by lusts which easily deceived us.
\v 23 For that reason, allow your heart and mind to be renewed by God's Spirit.
\v 24 Just like putting on a new shirt, in the same way your whole life should become new. For you've been created to become a new person who looks more and more like God. That means you'll truly live pure and right before Him.
\p
\v 25 So, because it's as if you've changed that old shirt— that is your old life, don't lie to your fellowman. “Say what's true to each other,”\x + Zach. 8:16.\x* because we're all parts of one body.
\v 26 And “when you get angry, don't let that anger make you sin.”\x + Ps. 4:4.\x* Stop being angry before the sun sets.
\v 27 In that situation, don't give the devil an opportunity to defeat you.
\v 28 If you were a thief before, you can't steal anymore. And you have to try to work with your own hands, so that you have your own profit and can share part of that profit with people who are in need.
\v 29 When you speak, don't let dirty words or words that are hurtful come out of your mouth. But speak what is necessary, so that your words help, bring about good things, and strengthen those who hear.
\v 30 And don't let your way of life make the Holy Spirit sad. For the Spirit is proof that you belong to God, and the Holy Spirit also guarantees your salvation at the last day.
\v 31 Throw away all feelings of bitterness, revenge, and anger from your life. Don't quarrel and insult each other. Stop doing all kinds of evil.
\v 32 But you should always be kind to each other, and love each other. And forgive each other's faults— like how God has forgiven you because you're one with Christ.
