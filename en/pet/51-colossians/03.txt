\s New life because of being one with Christ
\p
\v 1 As I just said, we consider ourselves to be one with the body of Christ when He came back to life from death and went up to heaven. Because of that, let's think like this: “I only long for heaven— where Christ Jesus sits at the right side of God!”
\v 2 So may our hearts and minds be focused on heaven, not on this world.
\v 3 For in this world, our lives are no longer like before we knew Jesus. But we've died to that way of life. And our spirits are with Christ Jesus in heaven— where He lives united with God.
\v 4 Our source of life is actually Christ. So when God shows our King to everyone, we'll also be shown with Him in the bright light of His glory!
\p
\v 5 For that reason, each of us should convince ourselves like this, “Every part of my body has died to the various desires of the world
\q1 like the desire to commit adultery,
\q1 other sexual sins,
\q1 lust,
\q1 the desire to do other evil things,
\q1 and the desire to have a lot of money.”
\m The desire to have a lot of money is just like worshiping idols, because you've become the servant of money.
\v 6 Those evil things make God angry, so He'll soon destroy all in this world who don't want to obey Him.
\v 7 And of course we must not forget that we also previously lived like them!
\p
\v 8 But now, let's all throw away all of the traits of the old life that are in us, like:
\q1 anger,
\q1 hating and slandering other people,
\q1 along with speaking unclean things.
\m
\v 9 And fellow brothers and sisters in the faith can't deceive each other. For we've thrown away those traits of the old life like that— like a person throws away ruined clothes.
\v 10 Now we've been given new clothes— that is a new life, which is changing day by day to become more like Jesus Himself. God the Creator has done this in us, because we already know Him through Jesus.
\v 11 For that reason, we no longer feel that there's a difference between Jews (the circumcised people group) and non-Jews (uncircumcised people groups). And we no longer observe whether someone comes from a foreign people group, or from an evil people group, or if a person has high status or is humble like a slave. But the important thing for us is that we've all become one people because of being one with Christ!
\s New life with other people
\p
\v 12 For that reason Brothers and Sisters, may these traits become like new clothing for us who've been chosen, loved, and purified by God as His own people:
\q1 compassion for each other in trouble,
\q1 generousity at all times,
\q1 humbleness,
\q1 gentleness,
\q1 and patience with others.
\m
\v 13 Let's not see the weaknesses of our brothers and sisters in the faith, but we should forgive each other— if there's someone who does wrong. Remember that God has previously forgiven our sins, so in the same way we are also obligated to forgive each other.
\v 14 But the most important trait of all of these is loving each other. Love should be like a bond that unites us completely.
\v 15 And may calmness in the protection of Christ control your hearts and minds. Because that's why God has called us to become members of one body— that is the body of Christ, so that we live united and calm. And let's always be thankful to Him.
\p
\v 16 May the teaching about Christ keep leading you and grow healthy in your hearts, so that you can teach and advise each other wisely. One way to do that is to sing songs that are based on the Book of Psalms, and other praise songs, along with songs that are given by God's Spirit. May your hearts always be filled with feelings of thankfulness to God.
\v 17 And in everything we say and do, we should do it as if we're representing the Lord Jesus in the world. And through Him we should keep thanking God the Father!
\s New life among the family
\p
\v 18 I urge every wife to follow the will of her husband, because that's the way of life that suits us who are one with the Lord.
\p
\v 19 Each husband is obligated to love his wife, and may not make her bitter.\f + \fr 3:19 \fk may not make her bitter \ft This phrase in the Greek language can also mean, “don't hold a grudge against your wife.”\f*
\p
\v 20 Also children, obey your parents in everything, because that really pleases the Lord.
\p
\v 21 And fathers, don't cause your children to be bitter. If you do that, they won't have inspiration to live well.
\s New life between masters and slaves
\p
\v 22 Each of you who've been sold to a rich person working as his slave, must obey him in everything. Don't obey him only when in his sight— like people who just want to please men. But obey them wholeheartedly, because you fear and obey the Lord Jesus.
\v 23 Whatever you do for your master, do it wholeheartedly. Because you are actually serving the Lord— not man!
\v 24 Remember that it's the Lord who'll give you your reward— that is when He gives what He has promised to us who have been adopted as His children. Don't forget that you're actually servants of Christ, who are working for Him.
\v 25 But the Lord will punish everyone who does dishonest things. And the Lord isn't partial!
