\v 1-2 Dear Brothers and Sisters in the faith, who live in the city of Colosse— that is you who've been purified by God because you're one with Christ and are faithful to Him:
\p From us, Paul and our brother, Timothy. Because of God's will, I, Paul became an apostle of Christ Jesus.
\p I pray that God our Father, will always be kind to each of you and watch over you so that you live calmly under His protection!
\s Paul gives thanks in prayer for the brothers and sisters in the faith in Colosse
\p
\v 3 When we pray, we're so thankful to God for you— who is the Father of our Lord Christ Jesus.
\v 4 We're thankful because we've heard that you keep fully believing in Christ Jesus and really love all of our brothers too— that is all of us who have been made holy by Him.
\v 5 And you keep believing and loving each other because you're confident that we'll surely receive what God has prepared for us in heaven. You've learned about that in the Good News— which is the true teaching about Jesus
\v 6 that has been given to you. From that news we truly know that God is very kind to us. That Good News is also being given in every region of the world. And like what happened among you, more and more people are becoming believers, and their way of life is being changed.
\v 7 The one who taught you that news was Epaphras. Of course he's a close friend of ours in Christ's service. And he works faithfully as our representative in your area.
\v 8 When he arrived here, he told us that you truly love us and all of God's people with the love that comes from the Holy Spirit.
\p
\v 9 For that reason, since we heard about you, we haven't stopped praying for you.
\mi We always ask God to make you be very wise people— so that through His Spirit you can understand the way to live that's according to His will.
\v 10 In that way, you'll always live as people who belong to the Lord Jesus, and He'll be pleased with everything you do. That means that you'll keep doing all kinds of good things, and keep progressing in knowing God.
\v 11 We also pray that God strengthens you with His very extraordinary power— so that you'll never surrender, and won't give up when you experience trouble. And we also pray that you'll keep rejoicing in any and every circumstance,
\v 12 and give thanks to God the Father.
\p He's the One who has appointed us to be His own possessions— so that we have the right to live in the glorious light of God forever, and receive everything that has been promised to the people He has purified.
\v 13 And God has released us from the kingdom of the powers of darkness, and made us citizens of the kingdom of His Son, whom He loves so much.
\v 14 That all happened because Jesus forgave us by paying the whole debt of our sins.
\s Christ is supreme in everything
\q1
\v 15 Christ Jesus reflects all of the attributes of God.
\q1 Although men can't see God,
\q2 we may know Him through His Son.
\q2 Christ is Supreme\f + \fr 1:15 \fk Supreme \ft Literally, “Firstborn Son.” Jesus is often spoken of as the ‘Firstborn Son’ in God's Word because the firstborn son has a special role in Jewish culture. The firstborn son inherited everything from his father, and became the leader over his younger siblings. This means that Jesus was the first to possess eternal life after death (Col. 1:18; Rev. 1:5), is Supreme over everything that has been created (Mzm. 89:28; Col. 1:15; Heb. 1:6), Ruler over all other children adopted by God (Rom. 8:29), Heb. 2:10-14), and the One who's the guarantee that every follower of Christ will be made alive again after death (1Cor. 15:20).\f* over everything that has been created.
\q1
\v 16 For through Him, God created everything that exists,
\q2 both on earth and in every level of heaven,\f + \fr 1:16 \fk every level of heaven \ft Literally “heavens” in the Greek language. That word is plural, so it can be translated “levels of the sky.” In the world view of Paul's time, they imagined that there were three to seven levels of the sky or heavens. The first is the air and the sky in the world— which we call the atmosphere, and above that is the place that's controlled by evil spirit powers, and above that there are some more levels, and finally the highest level is where God lives.\f*
\q1 both things that can be seen
\q2 and things that can't be seen by human eyes,
\q1 including all spiritual powers great and small,
\q2 and every kingdom on the earth.
\q1 God created all of that through Him,
\q2 so that His Son would become the King over all of that.
\q1
\v 17 Jesus already existed before everything was created.
\q2 And He's the one who arranges so that everything He created still continues.
\q1
\v 18 So Jesus is also the head over everyone who fully believes in Him—
\q2 that is we who function as His body in this world.
\q1 He's also the source of life for us,
\q2 and He was the very first\f + \fr 1:18 \fk very first \ft Literally, “Firstborn Son.” See the footnote in verse 15.\f* to possess eternal life after death.
\q1 This is according to the plan of God the Father—
\q2 so that His Son would become supreme in everything.
\q1
\v 19 For His Father Himself desired and decided that—
\q2 when his Son became a human, He would still possess the whole nature of God.
\q1
\v 20 And God planned this so that through Jesus, everything He had created—
\q2 both things on the earth and things that are in heaven,
\q2 would be at peace again with God the Father.
\q1 That peace only happens through the blood of His Son—
\q2 who's the one who bled when He was crucified.
\p
\v 21 Of course, before we knew Jesus, our lives were far from God, and we always opposed Him in our evil thoughts and deeds.
\v 22 But now, Jesus has become the Mediator— so that we're at peace with God. That happened when He— in the form of a human being, died on the cross in our place. So we've been purified in God's eyes, and cleansed without a spot— as if we had never sinned.
\v 23 That's true for us, if we keep believing the Good News which has now been given to you. That's the foundation for everything that we hope for. Don't move away from that foundation. Endure, because that news has been spread to every region of the world. I, Paul, have also been assigned to tell that news.
\s Paul's work for all of the followers of Christ
\p
\v 24 At this time, I'm happy because I know that what I'm suffering in this prison is actually for your sake, and for all of the followers of Christ. Each of us are like parts of Christ's body. So if one part suffers, it means that Christ Himself also suffers. It's the same for me. I've been chosen by Him to suffer in this prison in order to encourage all of you who believe.
\v 25 So according to God's plan, I've become a servant to all of you, and my task is to give the news of God fully to everyone— especially to you who aren't Jewish.\f + \fr 1:25 \fk especially … aren't… Jewish \ft This information was moved here from verse 27 to make Paul's meaning clear.\f*
\v 26 No one at all knew that news from the beginning of the world, because God kept it secret. But now that news has been revealed to us who've been purified by Jesus.
\v 27 God's news is very pleasing and very beautiful to everyone— including you who aren't Jews. And this is the core of it: Let Christ live in your hearts! Because Jesus' Spirit is in our hearts, we are increasingly confident\f + \fr 1:27 \fk confident \ft Literally, “hope.”\f* that we'll enter God's glory in heaven.
\v 28 That's the reason that we who've become apostles of Jesus keep telling the Good News! We try to use all of the wisdom that God has given us to advise and teach everyone. For we long to bring as many people as possible to God as members of the body of Jesus, who are mature in oneness with Christ.
\v 29 And I struggle and work hard for that— relying on Jesus who always gives me strength.
