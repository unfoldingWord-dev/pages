\v 1 Brothers and Sisters, I want you to know that I'm fighting hard to help you— that is all of the brothers in the faith who are in Colosse and Laodicea, and also to help all of our brothers who haven't seen me yet.
\v 2 This battle of mine is to urge all of you to believe in Jesus more, and love each other more sincerely, so that you'll be more unified. In that way you'll better understand and be certain that the plan of salvation which God showed us is an extraordinary blessing! The basis of that plan is to know our own King— who is Christ Jesus!
\v 3 He's like a key that opens our minds to everything that was formerly kept secret from mankind— which is the truly wonderful wisdom of God about His plan of salvation.
\p
\v 4 I'm saying this so that you won't follow misleading teaching, even if that teaching is given in a way that seems wise.
\v 5 Even though I'm not with you, my heart and thoughts are with you. And I will always be glad when I hear that you live in an orderly way, and are still strong in your fully believing in Christ.
\s We try to keep living in oneness with Christ
\p
\v 6 Because you've each received Christ Jesus as your Lord, keep on living united with Him.
\v 7 Be aware that you've become one with Jesus— just like a branch is one with the tree. Make the Lord the foundation of your life. Keep on fully believing in Him without waivering— as Epaphras has taught you. And always remember to give thanks to God.
\p
\v 8 Watch out so that you no one influences you to follow misleading teaching. Beware of people who want to teach you about things that they consider to be deep teachings, even though that's actually just human thinking. Don't be deceived along with them, because their teaching actually comes from the powers of darkness which rule in this world— not from Christ.
\v 9 Remember that God Himself always lives fully in the person of Jesus. It was that way when Jesus lived in this world with the body of a normal human being too.
\v 10 And remember that you have been fully united with Jesus and have been made complete by Him— who is King over all earthly and spiritual powers.
\p
\v 11 Because we've become one with Christ, we've all been truly circumcised— both males and females, not with a bodily circumcision, but with a spiritual circumcision. Spiritual circumcision means that we've been set free from the bondage to evil bodily desires.\x + Rom. 6; Gal. 5:16-25; Col. 3:5.\x*
\v 12 And being united with Jesus was demonstrated when we were baptized. In baptism, it's like our old life died, and it's as if we've been buried with Christ. Then we were raised again spiritually with Him. This new life that we experience happens because we believe that God— who raised Jesus from death, has power in our lives too.
\p
\v 13-14 This means that in our previous condition— even though we were still breathing, we were spiritually dead because of our sins. Our hearts weren't circumcised yet, meaning that we were still enslaved to various evil desires that come from ourselves. All of our transgressions against God’s law were written down in the book of our sins before God. And that sin was what separated us from God. But now God has nailed that book of our sins to Jesus' cross. That writing has been erased, and no longer separates us from God. That means that we've been forgiven of all of our sins. Then God raised us up with Jesus.
\v 15 So through His cross, in a very open way, God has defeated all the powers of darkness and destroyed their power.
\s We who are united with Christ don't rely on religious regulations
\p
\v 16 So we can't follow people who teach like this, “God will punish you if you don't join in celebrating that holiday, or this new moon festival,\f + \fr 2:16 \fk new moon \ft The first day of a Jewish month.\f* or the Sabbath Day, and other Jewish religious holidays.” People like that want to force us to fast and follow other regulations about food and drink too.
\v 17 The old ceremonies and regulations like that were just temporary religious traits that were required only for the time before Christ came. Those things just foreshadowed the relationship that we've received because we're united with Christ.
\v 18 Watch out! Don't follow the people who urge you to submit to and worship angels—\f + \fr 2:18 \fk worship angels \ft At that time, there were people who taught the followers of Christ to worship angels based on Jewish myths, the popular secret knowledge of that time, and based on their visions.\f* like they do. Or they'll say, “If you don't follow the message I've received in a vision, you won't be blessed by God.” It's worthless for people like that to brag about themselves, because their religion is just human thinking.
\v 19 People like that don't hold on to Christ any more. He's the head, and we who are one with Him are parts of His body in this world. It's similar to the parts of a human body— which can be one and move together because of the connection between the bones and tendons. It's the same for us as the body of Christ: He's the head who organizes and gives everything that's needed, so that we're unified and grow as God wants.
\p
\v 20 Remember that we who are one with Christ have considered ourselves to be crucified with Him. That means that we've also been set free from worldly things, including all the bonds of the spirits who have power in this world. If that's so, why do you still live as if bound by worldly things?
\v 21 The proof is that you still think we have to carry out teachings like this,
\li ”Don't eat even a little of this food.”
\li “Don't hold this thing.”
\li “Don't touch that thing.”
\m
\v 22 Regulations like that aren't important, because they're about things that are just temporary in this world. Take food, for example: After it's eaten, it doesn't exist anymore. And all regulations like that are just human commands and teachings.
\v 23 And people who teach those regulations may appear to be wise, because they teach regulations that humble one's self by torturing one’s own body. But religion like that is just man-made. And following those regulations isn't able to help us control the various evil desires that come from ourselves.
