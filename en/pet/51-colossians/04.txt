\p
\v 1 Each of you who own slaves, treat them right and honestly. You as a master can't forget that you have a Master in heaven!
\s Paul’s motivation to all followers of Christ
\p
\v 2 Keep fighting in prayer. Always be on guard to pay attention to things that need to be prayed for, and always be thankful to God.
\v 3 Remember that I'm imprisoned now because I tell the Good News about Christ— which God has revealed to us. For that reason, pray that God keeps giving us opportunities to tell that news too.
\v 4 Pray especially that I can tell it clearly, because that's the responsibility that God has given to me.
\p
\v 5 Think wisely about how to live among people who don't yet believe in Jesus, and use every opportunity that you're given so that He is glorified.
\v 6 Always speak with kindness, and what is sweet to hear. That way you'll learn how to answer each of their questions wisely, when they ask something about our King.
\s News about people who are with Paul
\p
\v 7 Tychicus— who's bringing this letter to you, is our beloved brother, who like us is one with the Lord Jesus. He and I are both servants of Christ, and he's faithful to help me in the ministry. He'll tell you about everything that's happening to me.
\v 8 That's why I have sent him to you. I hope that he will tell you about our situation here, and that he will encourage your hearts.
\v 9 With him I have also sent our beloved brother Onesimus. Onesimus comes from your congregation, and he's very faithful to Jesus. Our two brothers will tell about everything that's happening here.
\p
\v 10 Aristarchus— who's being held with me in this prison, sends greetings to you. And Mark— who's a cousin of Barnabas, also sends greetings. I've already sent you news about Mark. If he comes, I hope you'll receive him well.
\v 11 Justus— who was formerly called Jesus, also sends you greetings. Like me, those three brothers of the faith come from the Jewish people.\f + \fr 4:11 \fk from the Jewish people \ft Literally, “from the circumcised people.”\f* Those three are the only ones who work with me now so that more and more people become citizens of God's kingdom. I've been really comforted because of them!
\p
\v 12 Epaphras— who's from your church, also sends greetings to you. He's also working as a servant of Christ Jesus. He always struggles for you in prayer— so that you'll endure and become mature in following Jesus, and so that you'll be very certain about everything God desires for you.
\v 13 I testify to you that he truly struggles very hard for you— including the brothers and sisters in the faith who are in Laodicea and in Hierapolis.
\v 14 Luke— who's the doctor we love, and Demas, also send greetings to you.
\p
\v 15 Give our greetings to the brothers and sisters in the faith in Laodicea. We also send greetings to Nympha and to the church that normally meets in her house.
\v 16 After this letter has been read in your church, please send it on to Laodicea— so that they read it too. And I hope you also read the letter that I've written to the church in Laodicea.
\v 17 And I ask you to tell Archippus, “ Pay attention so that you finish the task that was given to you because you're one with the Lord Jesus.”
\p
\v 18 I, Paul, am the one writing these words of greeting with my own hand: Greetings from me! Don't forget to pray for me, bound with an iron chain in this prison! I pray that God will always be kind to you.
