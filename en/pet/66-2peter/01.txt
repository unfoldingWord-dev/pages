\v 1 Dear Brothers and Sisters of mine in the faith— that is you who've been blessed by God so that you completely believe in Christ Jesus just like we do. And because of believing you're blessed abundantly just like we are— that is we've been saved through what Christ Jesus did to make us righteous. He's our God and Savior!\f + \fr 1:1 \fk He's our God … \ft The New Testament acknowledges God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit— the Three-in-One, so Jesus is worthy to be called God. See John 10:30; Rom. 9:5; 1Jhn. 5:20.\f*
\p Greetings from Simon Peter, an apostle and servant of Christ Jesus.
\p
\v 2 Because each of you already know God and our Lord Jesus, I pray that God will always be very kind to you and watch over you, so that your lives are calm under His protection!
\s The way we become certain of our own callings
\p
\v 3 By His own power, God has given us everything that we need to live lives that are according to His will. All of those spiritual blessings were given to us because we truly know God— who has called us according to His glory and kindness.
\v 4 And also, through His glorious power and kindness, He has promised many things to us— promises that are very great and valuable. For through God's promises we receive God's Spirit Himelf and become one with Him. In that way, we're no longer bound by all kinds of sins that are caused by our evil desires. Those sins are controlling this world like a deadly disease that spreads.
\p
\v 5 Because of all of God's gifts and promises to us, let's not just merely believe in the things that have been promised to us, but let's all sincerely try to live out what we believe. The way to do that is— first, live well. Second, add to your knowledge about the way to live wisely.
\v 6 Third, learn how to control yourself. Fourth, learn how to endure in troubles. Fifth, try to live according to God's will more and more.
\v 7 Sixth, learn how to love the brothers and sisters in the faith. And seventh, we should show our love to everyone through our actions.
\v 8 For if all of those characteristics are in each of us and if we grow in those things more and more, then we will be proven to be people who truly know our Lord Christ Jesus. That means we will no longer be useless followers of Christ who don't glorify Him in our own lives.
\v 9 But if a brother or sister in the faith doesn't have those characteristics— it's as if his spiritual eyes are cloudy and he has almost become blind. A person like that forgets that his old sins were actually cleansed when he believed in Christ.
\p
\v 10 For that reason, Brothers and Sisters, try even harder to do the seven things that I wrote about above. For in that way, you make certain that you've truly been called and chosen by God. For if you keep doing those things, you won't fail to reach your heavenly goal, for sure.
\v 11 In that way, when you enter the eternal kingdom you'll be welcomed with great joy by our Lord and King of Salvation, Christ Jesus.
\s Our faith is based on God's Word
\p
\v 12 For that reason, I will keep reminding you of the things I mentioned, even though you already know and hold firmly to the true teaching that we've received from God.
\v 13 As long as I'm still living in this body— which is like a temporary tent, I feel responsible to keep reminding you of these things.
\v 14 For I know that in a short time I will die— as it was revealed to me by our Lord Christ Jesus.
\v 15 For that reason, I will keep on working hard so that you can always remember these things, even if I've died.
\p
\v 16 For when we told you about the power of our Lord Christ Jesus and His return to this world, we weren't like the false teachers who strengthen their teaching with their own made up legends in order to deceive people. For we've seen the greatness of Jesus ourselves.
\v 17-18 For we were the ones present on that holy mountain when He received honor and glory from God the Most Glorious Father. That is, when the voice of God was heard from heaven which said, “This is My Son whom I really love. He's the one who pleases My heart.”
\p
\v 19 That event made us more certain about all of the prophecies told by the prophets about His return.\f + \fr 1:19 \fk about His return \ft Literally, “prophetic word.” Because ‘prophetic word’ is singular, commentators differ as to what Peter meant here. Many say that the prophecy that is meant is all of the prophecies in the Old Testament about Christ's return as High King. Others say that the meaning is God's statment in verse 18. And others say that ‘prophetic word’ (singular) can mean everything the prophets said in the Old Testament or even the whole Old Testament.\f* For that reason, we should pay careful attention to those prophecies. For until the Lord Jesus returns, what was said by the prophets is like a light that shines illuminating this dark world. His coming will be like a new dawn arising in a new world, and at that time Jesus will illuminate our hearts like the morning star.
\v 20 This is what's important for us to remember: All of the prophecies written in the Holy Bible didn't come from the prophets own thoughts.
\v 21 For they never told prophecies according to their own will. But they told their prophesies according to what they received from God's Spirit.
