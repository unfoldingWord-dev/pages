\c 4
\p
\v 1 As a picture for us: When a father who has made a will dies before his child is an adult, then the status of that child isn't much different than the status of a slave— even though it is the child who owns all of his fathers estate.
\v 2 For as long as the child hasn't reached the age that was specified by his father in the will, he has to obey the overseers and mangers who were appointed to manage all of his needs.
\v 3 It's the same with us. As long as we weren't yet mature spiritually, we needed the Law, which became like our overseer, because we were still enslaved by the dark forces that rule this world.
\v 4 But at the exact time determined by God our Father in heaven, He sent His Son into this world. And according to God's plan, Jesus was born by a young woman like a normal human being, and from birth He lived obeying the whole Law.
\v 5 In that way, Jesus was prepared to be able to redeem us and free us who lived as slaves in the past, under the oversight of the Law. And He did that so that spiritually we were adopted to become God's children.\f + \fr 4:5 \fk adopted to become God's children \ft The Greek language literally uses one word that means the ‘adoption of sons’. That word was a Roman legal term which showed that our ‘adoption’ was legitimate legally, and we're all compared to sons, because in Roman culture only sons had the right to receive an inheritance. The same word is used in Rom. 8:15, 8:23, 9:4 and Ef. 1:5.\f*
\p
\v 6 So because we are His sons, He sent His Son's Spirit into each of our hearts. Because of that, we cry out to God with all our hearts, “Oh, Abba, my Daddy,”\f + \fr 4:6 \fk Abba, my Daddy \ft “Abba” was a word from the daily Hebrew language (Aramaic language). That word is easy to express, like ‘Daddy’ in the English language, and used by little children.\f* because we pray according to the leading of Christ's Spirit.
\v 7 That's proof that we're no longer like slaves, but are accepted as legitimate children of God. And as His children, we also have the right to inherit everything that has been promised to His children.
\s Paul feels like a father who worries about his children
\p
\v 8 In general, you who are in Galatia aren't Jewish. So before you knew God, you had become slaves to many different false lords— which are idols and spiritual beings that are called divine beings, even though they aren't.
\v 9 That's why it doesn't make sense that you who've known God— and in fact whom He acknowledges as His children, turn back to become slaves to things that are weak and useless— even to the powers of darkness which rule this world!
\v 10 The proof is that I hear that you've begun to perform various old religious requirements about certain days, or celebrations that are connected with the months, seasons, or years.\f + \fr 4:10 \fk days … years \ft It's quite possible that “days, months, seasons, and years” show things that were included in the Law or in Jewish traditions. For the Jews had various rules and traditions regarding the Sabbath Day, new moon celebrations, celebrations of the harvest season and other seasons, and new year celebrations. What Paul meant in this verse is that Christians in Galatia already had the status of adopted sons of God because of being one with Christ. So, performing Jewish religious ruless, or those of other religions, couldn't add anything to that status. And performing various old religious requirements became a threat, because a person could think that he was being saved because of his own efforts.\f*
\v 11 If so, I'm worried about you! Don't let all of my hard work to win many souls among you be for nothing.
\v 12-13 So Brothers and Sisters, I request that you be free from those old religious rules, just like I adapted myself and didn't follow all of the Jewish rules while I lived with you.
\p Certainly you still remember that my first visit to you happened because I was sick. But that was what became the opportunity for me to tell the Good News to you. Remember the way you welcomed me and never made fun of me.
\v 14 Even though my physical condition was so disgusting, you didn't reject or insult me. But you accepted me as a messenger of God, like receiving an angel, or Christ Jesus Himself.
\v 15-16 But now, I feel that your opinion about me has really changed! You used to feel blessed because of my presence. But now perhaps you consider me like an enemy because I have written these true things to you! I remind you that you used to feel really sorry for me, to the point that you were ready to pluck out your own eyes in place of mine— it that were possible!\f + \fr 4:15 \fk in place of mine \ft Literally, “you were willing to pluck out your eyes, and give them to me.” Paul didn't directly say that his eyes were the part of his body that was sick, but many commentators think that this is why Paul mentioned his eyes like this. Paul had once been blind. See Acts 9:8, 18.\f*
\p
\v 17 Those false teachers are trying hard to influence you so that you'll be on their side, but that's not good because it isn't done with sincere hearts. They want to distance you from us, so that you're inspired to follow them alone.
\v 18 Of course I'm happy if you're inspired, but it has to be for a good thing— whether I'm there or not.
\v 19 My children whom I love, because I'm worried about you, my emotion is like a mother's suffering when giving birth to her child. Of course I've become your spiritual father, but I'm very burdened again because you aren't yet mature in oneness with Christ!
\v 20 Yes, because of that how much I long to be with you again! If we could talk, I would know if your thoughts about following that misleading teaching have changed or not. If so, that means I could stop urging you to repent.
\s Hagar and Sarah are illustrations about the two promises of God
\p
\v 21 Now let me speak to you who want to turn back and live under the Law again: When will you understand what's written in the Book of the Law?!
\v 22-23 For it's written there that Abraham had two sons. The one son— Ishmael, was the son of a slave woman named Hagar, and Ishmael was born as usual— according to the plan of man. Whereas the other son— Isaac, was the son of a woman who wasn't a slave, named Sarah. The birth of Isaac happened in an amazing way— according to God's promise to Abraham.
\p
\v 24-25 We can illustrate those two women as symbols of the two promises of God— the old one and the new one. The first— who is Hagar, can also be illustrated by Mount Sinai in the land of Arabia— where God gave the Law to Moses. So all of those who still live bound to the Law become like spiritual descendants of Hagar— that is they live in a state as slaves. As another illustration, the children of Hagar are all of those who consider the present Jerusalem to be the capitol city of their country. That means they don't consider themselves to be freed yet from the bonds of the Law.
\v 26 But the capitol city of our country is the heavenly Jerusalem!\f + \fr 4:25-26 \fk capitol city … \ft Literally, “Jerusalem … which is our mother.” Paul compared Hagar to the earthly Jerusalem and Sarah to the heavenly Jerusalem. In order for these illustrations to be more natural and easy to understand in Indonesian, the TSI uses the word “mother city/capitol city.”\f* This means that we're like children of Sarah— who are not children of slaves.
\v 27 So because Sarah is considered to be our mother, then what will happen is what was prophesied about her in the Holy Bible,
\q1 “Oh woman who was barren in the past, rejoice!
\q2 Shout for joy, you who've never experienced the pains of childbirth!
\q1 For you who didn't have any descendants earlier
\q2 will have many more descendants than the woman who wasn't considered to be barren by her husband.”\x + Is. 54:1\x*
\p
\v 28 So Brothers and Sisters, we can be illustrated by Isaac— who was born according to God's promise. We also become Abraham's descendants according to God's promise to Abraham,\x + Gal. 3:6-9\x* and like Isaac, we aren't living bound by the Law.
\v 29 But like the opposition which happened between Ishmael— who was born according to the plan of man, and Isaac— who was born according to the will and power of God's Spirit, that's happening now between people who are still bound by the Law, and we who are freed by God's Spirit. That's why they persecute us.
\v 30 But listen to what the Holy Bible says:
\q1 “Drive out the slave woman and her son too! For the son born by the slave woman may not receive the inheritance with the son born by the mother who was free.”\x + Gen. 21:10\x*
\m
\v 31 So Brothers and Sisters, I need to emphasize this: We aren't like descendants of the slave woman who are obligated to live as slaves, but we're like descendants of the woman who was free.
