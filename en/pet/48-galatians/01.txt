\v 1-2 Dear Brothers and sisters of the faith in every church in the province of Galatia:
\p Greetings from me, Paul, and from all of the brothers in the faith who are with me.
\p I became an apostle, not because I was appointed or sent out by man, but I received this position directly from Christ Jesus, and from God the Father— who has raised Jesus up from death.
\p
\v 3 I pray that God the Father and our Lord Christ Jesus will always be kind to each of you, and watch over you so that you live calmly under God’s protection!
\v 4 According to the will of God the Father, Jesus has sacrificed Himself to erase our sins and save us from this evil age.
\v 5 Give glory to God forever and ever! Amen!
\s The Good News from God doesn't change
\p
\v 6 I'm so amazed because in such a short time you've turned away from God, who called you because of His kindness to be at peace with Him through Christ! And now you've followed a new kind of ‘good news’—
\v 7 which actually isn't Good News! That happened just because you were influenced by some people who want to change the original Good News about Christ.
\v 8 Don't be influenced! Whoever tells you good news about Christ that's different from what we've told you— even if it's me, another apostle, or an angel from heaven, has to be thrown into the lake of fire!
\v 9 I'm repeating and emphasizing what we've told you: Whoever tells you good news about Christ that's different than what you've received from us, has to be thrown into the lake of fire!
\p
\v 10 It's clear through what I've just written to you that I don't change my teaching to please men's hearts. I try to please the heart of God only! If I try to please man, it means I'm no longer Christ's servant.
\s How Paul was called by God to become an apostle
\p
\v 11 Brothers and Sisters, it's important for you to know that the Good News that I tell doesn't come from men.
\v 12 For I didn't receive that news about salvation from men, and I wasn't taught by anyone. Christ Jesus Himself told me that Good News.
\p
\v 13 You've known of my former way of life in the Jewish religion, of course, and you've heard how severely I persecuted all of the followers of Christ— who are the members of God's unified church, and tried to destroy them.
\v 14 And compared to most Jewish people my age, I studied the Jewish religion more in depth, and tried more zealously to obey all the rules that were given by our forefathers.
\p
\v 15-16 But I wasn't aware that for a long time, God had an amazing plan for me— even from the time I was still in my mother's womb. So according to the generosity of His heart, He allowed me to see and know His Son, then God called me so that I could tell the Good News about His Son to you who aren't Jewish. After that, I didn't immediately go to anyone and ask for their advice.
\v 17 I didn't go to Jerusalem to ask the advice of those who had become apostles of Christ much earlier. It happened that at that time, I went to the land of Arabia, and from there I returned to the city of Damascus.
\p
\v 18 Then, three years later, I went to Jerusalem to meet Peter.\f + \fr 1:18 \fk Peter \ft Paul literally wrote the other name for Peter— which is “Cephas.”\f* And I had the opportunity to stay with him for fifteen days.
\v 19 At that time, I didn't have the opportunity to meet the other apostles— except James, the brother of the Lord Jesus.
\v 20 God knows that what I'm writing is the truth! I'm not lying to you.
\v 21 After that, I went to several regions in the provinces of Syria and Cilicia.
\v 22 At that time, the members of the churches who were followers of Christ in Judea hadn't met me in person yet.
\v 23 They had just heard about me many times, “He who used to persecute us so harshly has now repented— and he even is telling the Good News that we have believed, that is the news of salvation which he once tried to do away with!”
\v 24 Then they praised God because of what God had done in me.
