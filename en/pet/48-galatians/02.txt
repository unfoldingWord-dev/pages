\s The other apostles acknowledge Paul as an apostle
\p
\v 1 After fourteen years, I went to Jerusalem again with Barnabas. Titus went with us too.
\v 2 I went there because God had directly told me to go. At that time, I had the opportunity to explain— in a personal way, to the most prominent people of the church there, about the Good News that I had told people who aren't Jewish. I did that because I didn't want all of my work to be considered useless— first of all in the Lord's sight, but also in the sight of man.
\p
\v 3 But even though Titus, who accompanied us, was non-Jewish, they didn't tell him to be circumcised.
\v 4 That had happened because several Jewish people had pretended to be fellow followers of Christ, and entered the Lord's churches secretly— with the intent of spying on us. For they wanted to spy on our freedom from Jewish religious rules— which we have because of oneness with Christ Jesus. They wanted to enslave us to be bound again to various rules and to the Law.
\v 5 But we didn't give in to follow their influence, in the least bit. For we wanted to maintain the true teaching that's found in the Good News about Christ, so that you can keep believing what we have taught you.
\p
\v 6 Then those who were considered the most prominent didn't suggest any addition at all to the Good News that I announce. (But I actually don't care about a person's status, whether they're prominent or not. And of course God isn't partial to anyone.)
\v 7 In the end those men realized that the ministry God gave to me was different from that given to Peter— specifically that God had given a special task to me to tell the Good News to people who aren't Jewish,\f + \fr 2:7 \fk people who aren't Jewish \fk Literally, “people who aren't circumcised.” And “Jews,” literally, “people who are circumcised.”\f* whereas Peter was given the task of telling the Good News to the Jews.
\v 8 For it has been proven that the God who gave Peter the special ability to be an apostle\f + \fr 2:8 \fk apostle \fk The root meanings of ‘apostle’ are ‘herald/announcer’ and ‘representative’.\f* to the Jewish people, also gave the same ability to me to be an apostle to people who aren't Jewish.
\v 9 So, when James, Peter, and John— who were included in that group of prominent men, realized that this special task was given to me based on God's kindness, they shook hands with Barnabas and I as an agreement, “May you serve the people who aren't Jews, and we'll keep serving the people who are Jews.”
\v 10 The one and only request they made of us was that we remember that our poor brothers and sisters in Jerusalem need help. And from the beginning I have always been ready to help them.
\s Paul rebukes Peter
\p
\v 11 But when Peter visited Antioch, I felt it necessary to rebuke him directly because his behavior was wrong.
\v 12 This is what happened: At the beginning of his visit to Antioch, he ate with people who weren't Jewish. Then when a group sent by James arrived, Peter separated himself and distanced himself from the non-Jewish people. He didn't want to offend the feelings of the Jewish group, because men in that group were those who insist on the circumcision of all our brothers who aren't Jewish.
\v 13 Then some other Jews followed Peter's way of just pretending to be good. They also stopped eating with the people who weren't Jews who were present there— and even Barnabas was influenced.
\v 14 So when I saw that their attitude wasn't in agreement with the true teaching in the Good News about Christ, before them all I directly rebuked Peter, “Even though you're a Jew, just recently you behaved like a non-Jew when you still associated with them. So now it isn't at all proper for you to associate with that group who want to force non-Jews to live according to Jewish rules!”
\s Jews and non-Jews are saved only through fully believing in Christ
\p
\v 15 Our\f + \fr 2:15-21 \fk Our (inclusive) \fk The Greek language doesn't distinguish between ‘our’ inclusive (kita) and ‘our’ exclusive (kami), so there are those who interpret that Paul's words to Peter ended with the last word in verse 14, or verse 16, or verse 21. It is likely that verses 15-21 are still like what Paul told Peter and all of the people at the meeting in Antioch.\f* brothers and sisters who were born Jewish— including myself, have at times, of course, followed the tradition of the Jews by calling people who aren't Jews ‘sinners’ because they don't obey the Law.
\v 16 But now we know that no man can be made right before God by obeying the Law. The only way to be made right before God is by believing in Christ Jesus— both for non-Jews and for Jews! Before now we who are Jews were evidently ‘sinners’ also, but now we have fully believed in Christ Jesus to be made right before God. It isn't possible to be made right in God's eyes by obeying the Law, because no one is able to obey the whole Law.
\p
\v 17 But there are Jews who fully believe in Christ, who still don't understand the way we're made right in God's eyes— which is only through being one with Christ. For them, if we no longer depend on the Law to become right before God, we've become ‘sinners’. That's definitely wrong! Becoming a follower of Christ definitely doesn't mean that we've become ‘sinners’!
\v 18 For we in the past taught, “Let's become right in God's sight by depending on Christ.” If we now teach, “Turn away from Christ and depend on the Law again,” it's very obvious that we're ‘sinners’!\f + \fr 2:18 \fr verse 18 \fr In this verse Paul uses the illustration of a building to symbolize a religious system, and uses ‘I’ hypothetically, as just an example. Paul wrote more literally, “For if I start to rebuild what I've torn down in the past, then I'm obviously a law breaker.”\f*
\v 19 And this is what I've experienced: When I tried in my own strength to obey the whole Law, I finally realized that I'm not able to do it, and would die in my sin. But it was paradoxically through this very state of despair that I received Christ and the gift of God— which is eternal life. Now I consider that I've been crucified with Christ.
\v 20 And I no longer control my life, but Christ— who lives in me, does that. I live my whole life in this worldly body only through faith in the Son of God, who loved me so much that He gave Himself to redeem me.
\v 21 So I don't want to turn away from God's kindness which we receive because of oneness with Christ in order to return to trying to be made right before God based on the Law. For if we think that man can be made right by obeying the Law, then it was in vain that Christ died to redeem us.
