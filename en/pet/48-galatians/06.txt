\s Live in brotherhood in the church
\p
\v 1 Brothers and Sisters, if there's someone within the church who's known to have fallen into sin, then each of you whose lives are led by the Holy Spirit should lead him back to the right road. But do that with gentleness, while continuing to guard yourself, so that you aren't also tempted to sin.
\v 2 Each of us should help to lighten the burdens of our brothers and sisters in the faith who experience weakness and trouble. In that way we obey the Law of Love given by Christ.\x + John. 13:34\x*
\v 3 For if you consider yourself to be too special to help those brothers and sisters of ours, you've deceived yourself. You aren't any more special than any other brothers in the faith!
\v 4 Don't compare yourself with other brothers and sisters in the faith. But you may evaluate your own deeds. Then you can be satisfied by the way you yourself serve Christ— without thinking about other people.
\v 5 For every one of us will face God and be accountable for our own deeds.
\p
\v 6 Each of us members of the church who receive the teaching of God's Word should share part of our earnings with those whose duty is to teach us.
\p
\v 7-8 Don't be mistaken! Don't think that you can play games with God's justice and righteousness! For sooner or later each of us will reap what we've planted. I mean that if you live only to satisfy your bodily desires, you'll receive destruction. But if you live depending on the leading of God's Spirit, you'll receive eternal life.
\v 9 So let's not be give up doing good deeds. For the time will come later on when we'll reap the results— if we don't give up.
\v 10 For that reason, every time we have the opportunity, let's keep doing good to everyone— especially to our brothers and sisters in the faith.
\s Final advice and closing words from Paul
\p
\v 11 In this last part, notice how big the letters are that I'm writing to you with my own hand.\f + \fr 6:11 \fk with my own hand \ft This also means that before this last part, there was a secretary who wrote according to what Paul said.\f*
\v 12 Once again, in regard to our brothers and sisters who used to be of the Jewish religion, and who force you to be circumcised: That isn't to help you, but they do it to please other Jews, and also so that they aren't persecuted because of our teaching about man being made right before God only through Christ's sacrifice on the cross.
\v 13 Of course they're circumcised, but they themselves don't obey the whole Law. However, what they want is for you to be circumcised so that they can brag about themselves by saying to other Jews, “Because of our teaching, the people in Galatia have now joined the Jewish religion.”
\p
\v 14 But I won't brag about anything— except our Lord Christ Jesus who was crucified! For through Jesus' crucifixion, for me all worldly things have also been crucified on His cross, and it's as if I've also died with Him to all worldly things.
\v 15 So there's no difference anymore between circumcised people and uncircumcised people. What's important is that each of our spirits have been renewed because of oneness with Christ— as if we've become new creations!\x + 2 Cor. 5:14-17\x*
\v 16 To each of you who live out your life as a new creation and don't brag about yourself, may God always have compassion on you and guard you so that you live with calmness in His protection, because spiritually you've become citizens of the new Israel— which is God's kingdom.
\p
\v 17 From now on, I won't care about people who criticize me by saying, “You don't serve God as greatly as I do.” And I will answer them, “These scars on my body are signs which prove that I'm a possession of Jesus who serves Him!”
\p
\v 18 Brothers and Sisters, I pray that our Lord Christ Jesus will always be kind to each of you and will always be with you. Amen.
