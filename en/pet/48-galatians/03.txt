\s We receive God's promises only through fully believing— not because of our good deeds
\p
\v 1 Brothers and Sisters in Galatia, why are you so stupid!? How can you be deceived so quickly?!— even though I very clearly explained to all of you about how Christ Jesus died on the cross for us!
\v 2 Just answer this question of mine: Did you receive the Holy Spirit because you obeyed the Law of Moses? Or was the Holy Spirit given to you when you heard the news of salvation and believed in Christ?
\v 3 Certainly it was when you believed— right?! If so, why are you so stupid as to think like this: “I don't need the leading of the Holy Spirit anymore. I will become perfect by my own ability to carry out the Law.”
\v 4 Just remember that as soon as you believed in Christ you experienced persecution. Don't waste that suffering of yours by turning away from believing and becoming nonbelievers!
\v 5 And think about your daily experiences too: When God helped you through the Holy Spirit by doing various miracles among you, did that happen as a reward for obeying the Law? Or did those various miracles happen because you heard the Good News and continued to fully believe in Christ?
\p
\v 6 It was because you fully believed, of course— wasn't it?! And that's what happened to Abraham. For the Holy Bible says,
\q1 “Abraham fully believed in God's promise, and that is why God accepted him as a righteous man.”\x + Gen. 15:6; Rom. 4:3; James 2:23\x*
\m
\v 7 Because of that, you should know that we who believe like Abraham will be accepted by God as descendants of Abraham, in a spiritual way.
\v 8 And because of that, the Holy Bible expresses God's will way in advance by prophesying that non-Jewish people would be made right by God based on fully believing. That's why God revealed that Good News to Abraham,
\q1 “By following your example, every people group will be blessed by God.”\x + Gen. 12:3\x*
\m
\v 9 So whoever believes in God's promise, like Abraham, our hero of the faith, also participates in being blessed like him.
\p
\v 10 For people who try to make themselves right before God by means of obeying the Law of Moses are cursed! For the Holy Bible says,
\q1 “Everyone who fails to obey all the commands that are written in the Book of the Law is cursed.”\x + Deut. 27:26\x*
\m
\v 11 So it's clear that no one at all can be accepted as a righteous person before God because of obeying the Law of Moses, because the Holy Bible says,
\q1 “The one who is considered righteous by the Lord will live forever, because he fully believes in Him.”\x + Hab. 2:4; Rom. 1:17; Heb. 10:38\x*
\p
\v 12 Whereas the Law of Moses isn't based on believing, but based on deeds. For it's written,
\q1 “A person's life is blessed only if he does according to all the commands of the Law.”\x + Lev. 18:5\x*
\m
\v 13 So we are all “cursed” because each of us “fails to obey all the commands that are in the Law.”\x + Deut. 27:26; Gal. 3:10\x* But Christ redeemed us from that curse by taking our place Himself as the one cursed. For it's written in the Holy Bible,
\q1 “The one who dies hanging on a wooden post is cursed.”\x + Deut. 21:23\x*
\m
\v 14 That was God's plan, so that the blessings promised to Abraham could be given to “every non-Jewish people group” too— not just to the Jewish people, which is to each of us who are one with Christ Jesus through fully believing. And through that faith, we also receive the Holy Spirit according to God's promise.\x + Acts 2:16-18; Joel 2:28-29\x*
\p
\v 15 Brothers and Sisters, let me give a simple example: If a person has made a promisory letter, or a will, and the letter has been made official, then no one may cancel it, or add other conditions to the letter.
\v 16-17 In the same way, the promise that God made official with Abraham and his descendants can't be changed. And at the time God promised this to Abraham, He didn't say, “to you and all of your descendants.” But He said to him, “to you and your descendant”— meaning Descendant, singular.\f + \fr 3:16 \fk your descendant… singular \ft In the Hebrew language, the promise of God literally said “to you and your seed.” Actually, in the Hebrew language and in the Indonesian language, which is almost the same, the word ‘seed’ is in the singular form, of course, but it's usually understood to mean plural. That's why most translations of the Old Testament use the plural form to translate these verses: Gen. 12:7, 13:15, 17:7, 24:7.\f* And the Descendant that's meant is Christ. So what I mean is this: The promise that was given by God to Abraham had long been official, before the Law existed— precisely 430 years before God gave the Law to Moses. Because of that, by giving the Law to Moses, God didn't cancel or change the promise that He made official with Abraham.
\v 18 So the blessing that we inherit from Abraham because of becomng one with Christ— who's the Descendant of Abraham, is not based on obeying the Law. For if it's based on our own deeds, then it isn't based on a promise. But of course the blessing was given by God, because of His kindness to Abraham, through the promise mentioned.
\p
\v 19-20 Because of that, there will of course be people who ask, “If man can only be made right by God by believing God's promise, then why did He give the Law too?” My answer: The Law was also given so that each of us would be aware of our transgressions. And the Law was in effect as long as man was waiting for the coming of the Descendant of Abraham, who had been promised. And note that God didn't give the Law directly to man by God Himself— like when He gave His promise to Abraham. But the angels gave it to Moses,\f + \fr 3:19 \fk angels gave it to Moses \ft The role of angels in giving the Law to Moses isn't mentioned in the Old Testament, but it became a teaching in Jewish tradition. What's mentioned in the Old Testament is that God sent His angels to lead the people of Israel. (See Ex. 23:20-23, Josh. 5:13) The Jewish teaching about the mediation of angels is affirmed by the New Testament. (See Acts 7:38, 53; Heb. 2:2.)\f* and Moses gave it to the people of God. Whereas with His promise to Abraham, God Himself gave it directly without an intermediary.
\p
\v 21 So, for sure some will want to ask, “If so, is the Law given by God in conflict with His promises to Abraham?” Certainly not! We must understand that the Law of Moses doesn't have power to give eternal life to anyone. The Law God gave not as a means for us to become right before God.
\v 22 And even the Holy Bible says that sin has control over the lives of all men.\x + Ps. 14:3, 53:4; Rom. 3:9-19\x* So the only way to be saved is by fully believing in Christ Jesus, and by believing, we receive the blessing that God promised to Abraham.
\p
\v 23 But while mankind was waiting for the coming of Christ— who was that Descendant of Abraham, and before we could be made right before God by believing, as mentioned, God gave the Law to control mankind. At that time, the Law of Moses became like a fence that confined us until the way was opened for us to believe and be given spiritual life.
\v 24 Or the Law of Moses can also be illustrated as a guardian who oversees, disciplines, and guides us to Christ, so that we have the opportunity to be made right by God through fully believing in Christ.
\v 25-27 But for those of us who now have believed and are one with Christ, we no longer need to be overseen and guided by that guardian.
\p All of us who are one with Christ Jesus through baptism have experienced new spiritual life— as if the character traits of Christ Himself cover us like new clothes. And through fully believing in God's Son, we all become God's children.
\v 28 So among us brothers and sisters in the faith, it isn't proper for us to distinguish any longer between Jews and people who aren't Jewish, or between slaves and free men, or between men and women. For we've all been united because of oneness with Christ Jesus.
\v 29 And as possessions of Christ, then through Him we all become descendants of Abraham who inherit God's promises.
