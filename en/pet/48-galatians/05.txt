\c 5
\s We've been set free by Christ
\p
\v 1 Christ has freed us from the obligation to live like slaves, so let us continue to be free! For that reason, stand strong and don't return to living like slaves still bound by the Law.
\p
\v 2-4 Listen to what I'm stressing: If you (men who aren't Jewish) follow the urging of those false teachers and allow yourselves to be circumcised by them, it's as if you're saying to God, “I don't need the salvation Christ worked on the cross anymore.” It's as if you've left Christ and are making an effort to save yourself according to Jewish religious rules. And I need to tell you that everyone who's circumcised by them is obligated to obey all the commands and all the rules that are found in the Law. For if you try to make yourself right before God by the Law, it's like you're breaking off your relationship with Christ, and as if you're telling God, “I don't need Your kindness!”
\p
\v 5 But this is the right way for us: We depend on the help of God's Spirit, and we truly wait for everything that's promised to those who fully believe God's promises. It is because of that that He accepts us as righteous people!
\v 6 Because for us who are one with Christ Jesus, there's no difference between people who are circumcised or uncircumcised. What's important is that we love our brothers and sisters in the faith because we completely believe in Christ!
\p
\v 7 I saw that you had progressed well earlier, and were becoming more mature spiritually. Don't listen to people who persuade you to stop following true teaching anymore.
\v 8 Those people's teaching doesn't come from God who called you to follow Christ.
\v 9 Remember this proverb, “A little yeast makes all of the dough rise”\f + \fr 5:9 \fk Verse 9 \ft In the Jewish culture, yeast illustrated sin or evil. Compare with 1 Cor 5:6-8.\f*
\v 10 Because I know that you're the Lord's own possessions, I'm also certain that you'll change your opinion like I've advised in this letter. But the people who confuse your thinking will be punished by God!
\p
\v 11 Pay attention, Brothers and Sisters, if I change my teaching by teaching that each of our male members must first be circumcised in order to be accepted by God, then I won't be persecuted anymore by the Jewish people. But I teach that we're made right before God only through what Christ did for us on the cross. That's what has become a huge issue for them.
\v 12 Circumcision alone isn't enough for the teachers who have confused you. Each of them should cut off his whole sexual organ!
\s Let's live by depending on the Holy Spirit
\p
\v 13 So Brothers and Sisters, we've been called by God to a life that's free from the bonds of the Law. But let's not use our freedom as an excuse to satisfy our bodily desires. Instead we must serve each other because we're motivated by the bond of brotherly love.
\v 14 For the whole law has been summed up in one command— which is, “Love your fellowman like you love yourself.”\x + Lev. 19:18; Matt. 22:39; Mark 12:31; James 2:8\x*
\v 15 But beware that you aren't like wild animals that keep biting and eating each other— to the point that you destroy each other!
\p
\v 16 So this is my advice to each of you: Live in obedience to the leading of the Holy Spirit. In that way, you won't satisfy your evil bodily desires.
\v 17 For the evil desires that come from our bodies always oppose the desires of the Holy Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit oppose our desires. For both of them oppose each other, and both of them are inside each of us. So we can't live as we please.
\v 18 But in every situation where we're led by the Holy Spirit, we don't need to be supervised by the Law anymore.
\p
\v 19 It's already very clear that if we live according to our evil bodily desires, then we will fall into these sinful deeds:
\q immorality, unnatural sexual relations, following lustful desires,
\v 20 worshiping idols, involvement in sorcery, hating other people,
\q fighting, jealousy, getting angry easily,
\q selfishness, causing division, being involved in groups teaching false things,
\q
\v 21 envy, drunkenness, partying without moral limits,
\q1 and all other sins.
\m Now I'm repeating what I had warned you when we were still together: People who do things like that won't become citizens of God's kingdom.
\p
\v 22 But if the Holy Spirit is leading our lives it will be shown thour our
\q loving each other, being joyful, living peacefully,
\q being patient in troubles, being generous, helping our fellowman,
\q keeping our promises,
\v 23 being gentle, and being able to control ourselves.
\m Things like this certainly aren't forbidden by the Law!
\p
\v 24 We who've becoming possessions of Christ are no longer controlled by lustful desires and all our bodily desires. It's as if we've nailed our lusts and bodily desires to Christ's cross.
\v 25 We were given new life by God's Spirit. For that reason, let's keep living in obedience to the leading of the Holy Spirit too.
\v 26 Let's not become arrogant and say in our hearts, “I'm better than other brothers and sisters in the faith.” Also don't say directly to someone, “I'm better in the Lord's eyes than you are!” And let's not be envious thinking, “My brother in the faith has become greater in the church than me.”
