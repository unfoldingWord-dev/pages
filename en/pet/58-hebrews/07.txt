\s The priest Melchizedek was greater than Abraham
\p
\v 1 Melchizedek was the king of Salem, and a priest of the Most High God. He's the one who met Abraham, when Abraham was coming back with his friends from war, having conquered all the troops from several kingdoms. On that day, Melchizedek blessed Abraham.\x + Gen. 14:18-19\x*
\v 2 And Abraham gave Melchizedek one tenth of all the treasure that he had captured in that war. Melchizedek's name means “king of justice.” But the name of his city was “Salem”— which means “peace.” So it can be said that he was the king of peace, too.
\v 3 But there's nothing written in the Holy Bible regarding his father, or where he came from. There's no explanation about where he was born either, or when he died. So the priest Melchizedek can be equated with God's own Son Himself— who has the role of priest forever.
\p
\v 4 So we see that Melchizedek was a very important person, of course, because Abraham— our famous forefather, gave him a tenth of all the best treasure that was carried off in the war.
\v 5 But in days to follow, the Law said that “only the ministers of God's Tabernacle— who were people from the tribe of Levi, had the right to receive a tithe from the people of Israel.”\x + Num. 18:21\x* They receive that tithe from their own brothers and sisters, who're also Abraham's descendants.
\v 6 Even though Melchizedek was not a Levite, he received that tithe from Abraham. And Melchizedek also blessed Abraham— our forefather, who had received God's promises.
\v 7 And we know that the person who blesses is always greater than the person who receives the blessing.
\p
\v 8 Think about these differences too: Those ministers from the tribe of Levi, who receive the tithe, are just humans who will die. Whereas the testimony of God's Word about Melchizedek is that he lives forever.
\v 9 And it can be said that Levi, himself— the forefather of those who have the right to receive the tithe, paid a tithe to Melchizedek through Abraham,
\v 10 because when Abraham met Melchizedek and gave a tithe, Levi wasn't born yet. So it may be considered that Levi was present even though he was still in Abraham's body.
\s Jesus is the Priest according to the pattern of Melchizedek
\p
\v 11 So now we can make a conclusion: It's obvious that spiritual perfection can't be achieved through the ministry of the descendants of Levi— even though their ministry is based on the Law. For if spiritual perfection could have been achieved through them, God wouldn't have needed to send a different Priest, who didn't come from the descendants of Levi and Aaron.
\v 12 And if God sent a Priest using a different way than what was already determined, it means the whole Law has to be changed.
\v 13-14 By that I mean, our Lord Jesus didn't come from the tribe of Levi— but from the tribe of Judah. People from that tribe have never served animal sacrifices on the altar in God's Temple, and Moses didn't permit people from that tribe to work as priests.
\p
\v 15 The difference that has happened becomes clearer when we realize that this new Priest is like Melchizedek.
\v 16 He was raised up as High Priest— not because of the old rule which was based on physical descendants, but because He possesses power which can't be destroyed, that is power to live forever.
\v 17 This is what was written in the Holy Bible about Him,
\q1 “You have the position of Priest forever— according to the pattern of the Melchizedek, the priest's appointment.”\x + Ps. 110:4; Heb. 5:6\x*
\p
\v 18 So now we see that the old Law has been cancelled, because that law was too weak and useless,
\v 19 because no one will ever become perfect before God by obeying the law. But now a new way has been opened up for us to reach what we hope for— where we can meet God directly.
\p
\v 20-21 And we can be more certain of this new way— which is through our High Priest, Jesus, because He was authorized by God with an oath, whereas the other priests were appointed without an oath. For God swore to Jesus, as it's written in the Psalms of David,
\q1 “The Lord has promised with an oath, and won't change His mind:
\q2 ‘You have the position of Priest forever— according to the previous pattern of the Priest Melchizedek's appointment.’”\x + Ps. 110:4; Heb. 5:6, 7:17\x*
\m
\v 22 So because God swore like that, it's clear that this new promise of God is guaranteed more than the old promise with Israel's forefathers. And it's also clear that Jesus is our Mediator\f + \fr 7:22 \fk Mediator \ft The word translated Mediator can also be translated ‘Sponsor’ or ‘Guarantor’.\f* in this new promise.
\p
\v 23 There's also this difference: According to the old rules, there's always a change of high priest, because every high priest is prevented from continuing in his position by death.
\v 24 But Jesus lives forever, so as High Priest, He'll never be replaced by anyone else.
\v 25 For that reason, Jesus can perfectly save each of us who come to God through Him, because He lives forever, and is always ready and willing to ask God to help us.
\p
\v 26 So Jesus is the High Priest who's really fitting for us, because He's holy, and in Him there's no sin or any wrong at all! He was also raised up to the place that's separated from sinners— which is the most honored place in heaven.
\v 27 He isn't like the other priests who needed to present sacrifices everyday, and they each had to present sacrifices for their own sins before serving offerings for the sins of others. But Jesus offered His own life as an offering just once, forever.
\v 28 Of course this difference happened because the Law appoints a high priest from normal human beings— even though they have weaknesses, whereas the promise that was accompanied by God's oath, and was given after the Law, appoints God's own Son as High Priest. So He's the High Priest who's really perfect and exactly right for us, forever!\f + \fr 7:28 \fk really perfect and exactly right for us \ft Literally, ‘has been perfected’. In Heb. 2:10-11 and 5:8-9, Christ was perfected through suffering, according to God's will. In this chapter, the writer of the Letter to the Hebrews shows that Christ is exactly right as our High Priest because of God's oath, and because He doesn't have limitations and weaknesses like every human high priest who was appointed according to the Mosaic Law.\f*
