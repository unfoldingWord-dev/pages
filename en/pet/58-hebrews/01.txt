\s God has spoken to us through His Son
\p
\v 1 Since the beginning, God spoke to our forefathers many times. He gave His messages through the prophets in different ways,
\v 2 but now, in the last days of this world,\x + 1 Cor. 10:11; 1 Pet. 4:17; 1Jn. 2:18\x* God has spoken to us through His own Son. God had determined long ago that His Son would own everything. Then He created everything that's in the heavens and on this earth through the work of His Son.
\v 3 His Son reflects all of God's glory, and He's the visible and true picture of God's existence. Through His powerful command, His son arranges so that everything that was created by Him still continues. After He died to cleanse us from our sins, He went back to heaven where He sits in the most honored place near the Most Glorious God— that is at His right side.
\v 4 That way it's clear that the status given to His Son is far higher than the status of any of the angels. So the relationship between the Son and His Father is also much closer than the relationship between God and the angels.
\p
\v 5 For God has never spoken like this to the angels:
\q1 “You're My Son.
\q2 Today I'm announcing that I'm Your Father.”\x + Ps. 2:7\x*
\m God also never spoke about angels like He spoke about His Son through the words of this prophet,
\q1 “I'll become His Father,
\q2 and He'll become My Son.”\x + 2 Sam. 7:14\x*
\m
\v 6 Furthermore, when God sent His firstborn Son into this world He commanded,
\q1 “Let all the angels worship My Son.”\f + \fr 1:6 \fk Let … My Son \ft These words are found in Deut. 32:43 in an old Greek translation, and in a Hebrew scroll from Qumran.\f*
\p
\v 7 But regarding the angels God only said,
\q1 “The angels do God's work as quickly as the wind.
\q2 The power that's given to them is like a flame of fire.”\f + \fr 1:7 \fk quote \ft This quote is from Ps. 104:4 in the Septuagint— which is the translation of the Hebrew language into the Greek language that was made over 100 years before Christ. In the Hebrew language, this verse can be translated, “He makes the (various kinds of) winds to become His spokesmen, and flaming fire is like His servant.” The translation in the TSI text is according to word order in the Greek language, however the Greek language doesn't depend on word order and can be understood like the Hebrew language above. The word ‘winds’ can also be translated ‘spirits.” What's important is that in the context of this chapter, and according to verse 14, the angels are just humble servants of God.\f*
\m
\v 8 Whereas to His Son, God says,
\q1 “My Son, You are God who'll rule from the throne of Your kingdom forever.
\q2 The authority that You'll show with the scepter of Your kingdom will always produce justice.
\q1
\v 9 You love people who do right, but hate people who do evil.
\q1 That's why I— as Your God, have already appointed You,
\q2 and anointed You with oil as a sign that Your kingdom brings joy.
\q2 And that joy is greater than the joy I give to all of Your friends.”\x + Ps. 45:7-8\x*
\m
\v 10 And God also said— not to the angels, but to His Son Jesus,
\q1 “You're also the Lord who created the foundation of this earth,
\q2 and with Your own hand You made everything in the heavens.
\q1
\v 11 All of creation will disappear, but You always exist forever.
\q2 All those things will be ruined like old clothing.
\q1
\v 12 And later on You'll roll up and throw away all of creation that's ruined— like when a person rolls up and throws away clothing that's ruined.
\q2 Then, like a person puts on new clothing, You'll replace everything that's ruined and make it new.
\q1 But You yourself will never change,
\q2 and Your life will never end.”\x + Ps. 102:26-28\x*
\m
\v 13 And God has never spoken like this to the angels,
\q1 “Sit at My right side and rule as King
\q2 until I defeat everyone who opposes You, and make them your slaves.”\x + Ps. 110:1; Mat. 22:44; Acts 2:34-35; 1 Cor. 15:25\x*
\m
\v 14 But the angels are spirits who serve God, who're sent by Him to help us who're being saved.
