\v 1 We know that every high priest of the Jewish religion was chosen from among normal people. And the high priest had the duty as a mediator between God and man, so that various voluntary gifts and sacrifices to pay for the sins of man could be given to God according to the rule of the Law that was in effect.
\v 2 Because every high priest was a normal human being, he was still aware of his own weaknesses too. In that way, he could have an understanding heart for with his fellowmen who had done wrong, because of their ignorance about God's will.
\v 3 And that's the reason a high priest had to offer a sacrifice for his own sin first, before offering a sacrifice for the sins of his fellowmen.
\p
\v 4 It was a great honor for someone to become a high priest, because a man couldn't appoint himself to be high priest, but God is the One who chose him— just like Aaron long ago.
\v 5 It's the same with Christ. He didn't appoint himself to become High Priest, but it was God who chose Him for that most honored position, when He said to Christ,
\q1 “You're My Son,
\q2 Today I'm announcing that I'm Your Father.”\x + Ps. 2:7; Ibr. 1:5\x*
\m
\v 6 And again in another verse God said to Him,
\q1 “You have the position as a priest forever, according to the pattern of Melchizedek, the former Priest's appointment.”\x + Ps. 110:4\x*
\p
\v 7 While Jesus lived in this world, He always prayed, requesting God's help, crying with many tears. For He believed that God could surely save Him from death. And God answered His request because Jesus always trully respected God.
\v 8 Even though Jesus is God's Son, He was also willing to suffer in order to prove that He was obedient to God.
\v 9 After He experienced all that suffering, His experience was perfect and complete in God's sight, so Christ has become the Savior and source of salvation forever, for all of us who're obedient to Him.
\v 10 And He's also the source of salvation for us because God appointed Him as High Priest— not following the descent of Aaron, but following the pattern of Melchizedek, the Priest's appointment.
\s Motivation to become mature spiritually
\p
\v 11 Actually, there are still many things about Jesus and Melchizedek that I want to explain to you. But these things aren't easy to explain because I already know that you don't want to try to understand.
\v 12 Of course, it's now time for you to become teachers, but until now you still need someone else to teach you the basics from God's Word. You're still like babies who can only drink milk, and can't eat solid food yet.
\v 13 For whoever still drinks only milk is still a baby. A person like that isn't ready to receive higher teachings yet, because they haven't yet been trained how to distinguish teaching that's true from teaching that's misleading.
\v 14 Whereas, people who're mature spiritually are ready to receive higher teachings, because they've trained themselves to distinguish between right teaching and teaching that's evil.
