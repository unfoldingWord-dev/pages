\s Various rules about the way to worship God according to the old promise
\p
\v 1 In the first promise, there were various ruless about how to worship God in the Lord's earthly Tabernacle.
\v 2 The yard of the Lord's Tabernacle was fenced, and the Tabernacle had two rooms in the back of that yard. The first was called the Holy Room. There was a lamp and a table in this room. And every Sabbath Day, bread was set out before the Lord on top of the table.
\v 3 The door of the Holy Room was separated by a cloth curtain. In back of that first room was an entrance to the second room, and that doorway was restricted by a second cloth curtain. That second room was called the Most Holy Room.
\v 4 In that second room there was a small altar made of gold— which was used to offer incense. And the Ark of the Covenant, which was all covered in gold, was there too. A golden bottle filled with the food called manna was kept in the ark.\x + Ex. 16:4-36]\x* And the staff of Aaron which had sprouted, and two stone tablets on which God's Ten Commandments were written were also in there. The two tablets were the proof of the first promise with God.
\v 5 On top of the ark, there were two carved guardian angels which faced each other— with the wings of the two angels opened wide to protect the cover of the chest. The carved angels symbolize the glory of God. The cover of the chest was called the ‘Place for Making Peace’.\f + \fr 9:5 \fk Place for Making Peace\ft The high priest sprinkled the blood of animals there for the forgiveness of the sin of the people of Israel.\f* But now isn't the time to explain all of these things in detail.
\p
\v 6 After all that was prepared, like I've explained, the priests went in and out of the Holy Room everyday to perform their duties.
\v 7 But only the high priest could enter the Most Holy Room, and that was just once a year. When he entered, he had to bring the blood of two animals to sprinkle on the Place for Mking Peace. The blood of the first animal was sprinkled for his own sin, and the blood of the second was for sins that weren't intentionally done by the people of Israel.
\v 8 Through those various rules, the Holy Spirit showed that the way to enter the Most Holy Room and come directly before God wasn't open yet. As long as the first room still existed, it meant that we as ordinary people couldn't enter there.
\p
\v 9 This is an illustration that shows the difference between the old system and the new system. In the old system, the voluntary gifts and sacrifices to forgive sin were offered to God, of course, yet it all couldn't make the consciences of the people who brought those offerings perfectly clean.
\v 10 All of those offerings were just religious rules about food, drink, and various customs of cleansing. Those were all just rules about physical things, and only valid until God improved everything with the new system.
\s The perfect ministry of Christ in the Lord's Tabernacle in heaven
\p
\v 11 So now Christ has become our High Priest. We receive all the good things that God promised to us through Him. The Most Holy Room where He serves, is the one in heaven, and is perfect— not the earthly tabernacle that was made by human hands.
\v 12 And when Christ entered that Most Holy Room, He didn't bring the blood of a male goat or bull calf, like the high priest did under the old system, but he brought His own blood to make the payment to buy us back, once forever.
\p
\v 13 Under the old system, the blood of a goat or bull was sprinkled on the worshipers to cleanse their bodies of uncleanness. Or in the ritual of cleansing, each person was sprinkled with a mixture of pure water and ashes from a burnt sacrifice of a young female cow.\x + Num. 19:9, 17-18\x*
\v 14 But in the new system, the blood of Christ—that is he who offered Himself as a sacrifice through God's Spirit, the Spirit who lives forever, is so much stronger! His blood, which was really perfect, purifies every part of us so that we no longer desire to involve ourselves in deeds that lead to spiritual death.\f + \fr 9:14 \fk deeds … spiritual death \ft See the footnote for Heb. 6:1.\f* In that way, we are truly free to serve the living God.
\p
\v 15 So with this new promise, Christ is the Mediator between us and God. In that way, we who've been called by God can receive all the blessings which were promised by Him— that is blessings that last forever, as if we inherit those blessings. And Christ is worthy to be the Mediator because His death was necessary to pay the price to buy back mankind, because no one could be completely forgiven through the various sacrifices done under the old promise.
\p
\v 16 And because of Christ's death, the new promise with God went into effect in a natural way— like an agreement made in a will. This is how it's done: A will only goes into effect when the maker of the will is proven to be dead,
\v 17 for a will becomes legal when the maker of the will has died. If that person is still alive, the will isn't in effect yet, of course.
\v 18 It was the same when the first promise of God with the people of Israel was legalized by the blood of animals.
\v 19 For after Moses told all of the commands of the Law to all of the people of Israel, he mixed the blood of some bulls and goats with water. Then he used a string of red wool, which had been tied to branches of the hysop plant as a tool for sprinkling, and with that tool, he sprinkled the mixture of blood on the Book of the Law and on all the people
\v 20 while saying, “This blood is the sign that the promise with God is legal, and we're obligated to follow these commands.”\x + Ex. 24:8\x*
\v 21 And in the same way, Moses also sprinkled that blood on the Holy Tabernacle and on all the utensils that were used in worship.
\v 22 And it can be said that according to the Law, almost everything had to be purified with the blood of the animal sacrifice, and sin wasn't forgiven without the blood of animal sacrifices.
\p
\v 23-24 Remember that the Holy Tabernacle on earth, which was purified like that, is only a picture or shadow of the true one in heaven. So if the earthly tabernacle, which was made with human hands, had to be purified with the blood of animals, of course the true tabernacle had to be purified with an offering that's far more glorious than the blood of an animal sacrifice. And that's what happened when Christ entered the true Most Holy Room, with His own blood! So He's still there as Mediator for us before God.
\p
\v 25-26 Christ isn't like the earthly high priest— who was forced to enter the Most Holy Room every year, bringing blood that wasn't his own. If Christ had been like that, it would mean that He would have had to suffer and offer Himself over and over again since the creation of the world. But according to the will of God, Christ came to this world just once to offer Himself as a sacrifice to erase sin. And in that way, in this current age, so many prophecies of the prophets became reality!
\p
\v 27 Of course, God has determined that we humans live and die only once, and after that we're judged.
\v 28 In the same way, Christ died as a sacrifice to bear all of our sins just once. But when He comes a second time, He won't have to do deal with the problem of sin again. That will be the time when all of us who're really longing for His coming will receive the salvation that we're hoping for!
