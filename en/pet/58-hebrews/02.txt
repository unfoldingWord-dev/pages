\s Let's not make the salvation that we receive directly through Jesus worthless
\p
\v 1 So let's pay attention to the teaching that we've received from Jesus, God's Son, and obey it more sincerely, so that we aren't led astray by the evil direction of this world.
\v 2-3 For if the commands of God which were given to Moses through angels must be obeyed, we must be more obedient to the teaching which was given directly to us by God's own Son, for sure! Israel's history shows that the whole Law was proven true, and whoever didn't obey it received pay back from God according to his deeds. So let's not think that we can escape God's punishment if we don't appreciate and don't follow the news of salvation which was given by the Lord Jesus Himself! And we need to remember that we received that news of salvation from the first people who heard it directly from the Lord. They firmly explained to us that this news is true.
\v 4 God Himself also proved that this news is true— by doing all kinds of miracles, and through various special abilities which were given to us by the Holy Spirit, according to the will of God.
\s Christ became a man for our salvation
\p
\v 5 For the angels weren't chosen by God to rule over ‘the new creation’,\x + Heb. 1:11-12\x* which we're talking about.
\v 6 But it's written in the Holy Bible that a person said frankly to God,
\q1 “Oh God, why do You care for man?
\q2 And why do you have compassion on us descendants of Adam?\f + \fr 2:6 \fk descendants of Adam \ft Literally, ‘sons of man’. Here the use of ‘sons of man’ is translated according to the normal meaning in the Hebrew language— which is ‘normal human beings’. In the New Testament, ‘Son of Man’ was usually specifically a name for the King of Salvation. See the notes in Matt. 9:6 or John 1:51.\f*
\q1
\v 7 You've made our status lower than the angels, for a short time,
\q2 but You've made us like glorious kings who are honored over all other creatures,
\q1
\v 8 because You've put everything under the authority of us human beings.”\f + \fr 2:6-8 \fk quote \ft This quote is from Ps. 8:5-7. Before Christ came, Psalm 8 was already considered to be included with the Psalms that appeared to be prophecies about Christ. After Jesus returned to heaven, His followers reinterpreted all of these prophecies about Christ, and began to understand things that weren't previously understood by readers before His coming. One example is the interpretation of the writer in verses 8b-9. It should be understood that all parts of the Psalms that are considered to prophecies about Christ can also be interpreted to be about normal human beings. For example, all the nouns about humans in the quote above can be understood as plural (‘descendants of Adam’ and ‘us’) or as singular ‘him’— which is appropriate for a prophecy about Christ. And regarding the words ‘sons of man’ especially— which are translated above as ‘descendants of Adam’, it's possible that the writer of Hebrews intentionally used that quote with two meanings— which are 1) the meaning of ‘normal human beings’ and 2) recalling the name Jesus often used for Himself.\f*
\m Of course the Lord's Word says that God has put ‘everything’ under our authority— meaning that there's no spirit or other creature who doesn't submit to us. But until now, we haven't yet seen that in reality— where we rule ‘as kings’ over ‘everything’.
\v 9 But the reality we see now is Jesus! As in God's Word earlier, when Christ lived in this world, “He was made lower in status than the angels for a short time.” But now, in heaven, God has crowned Him with the crown of the kingdom. This means that He's the one who's now the glorious ‘King’, who's ‘honored over all other creatures’. That happened to Him because He sacrificed His own life for all of us, according to God's kindness to us.
\p
\v 10-11 God Himself has created everything, and all creation was made to glorify God. Because of that, it's very proper for God to obtain many children— who we are, so that we'll live with Him in His glory. And God decided that His firstborn Son— Jesus, must be worthy to become the King of Salvation and the perfect Mediator through His suffering for us as God's adopted children. So it's Jesus— who made us holy, and we who're purified by Him also call God ‘our Father’. For that reason, Jesus isn't ashamed to call us His ‘brothers and sisters’!
\v 12 This agrees with what was written in the Holy Bible, when Jesus said to God,
\q1 “Oh God, I'll make You known\f + \fr 2:12 \fk make You known \ft Literally, “tell Your name.”\f* to My brothers and sisters.
\q2 I'll sing praise to You in the gathering of all Your people.”\x + Ps. 22:23\x*
\m
\v 13 He also said,
\q1 “I'll keep trusting in God's help.”\x + Is. 8:17\x*
\m And He also said,
\q1 “I'm here— along with the children God has given to Me.”\x + Is. 8:18\x*
\p
\v 14 Notice that we, whom Jesus calls His ‘children’, are normal human beings who consist of flesh and blood. For that reason, it was proper for Jesus Himself to become a normal human being, with a normal body too. In that way, through His death, He could destroy the devil— that is the one who has power over the kingdom of death.
\v 15 In that way, Jesus has already freed us— who used to be controlled by the fear of death for as long as we live.
\v 16 It's clear: It isn't the angels whom Jesus helped, but we who're the descendants of Abraham.
\v 17 Because of that, Jesus had to become a human being like us, His brothers and sisters, in every way. In that way, He could become a High Priest— who is full of compassion and very faithful in that role before God for us. As the priests always used to bring the blood of animal sacrifices to God, to make peace for man with God, now our High Priest, Jesus\f + \fr 2:17 \fk High Priest, Jesus \ft A priest was a leader in God's House. The duty of a priest was as a mediator (middleman) between man and God, and especially as the mediator of offerings which were given by the people to God. In the beginning, every man could bring his own offering to God, without a middleman. (Gen. 8:20, 12:7, 13:4, 26:25, 31:54, Job 1:5) Melchizedek was the first person who was called “a priest” in Gen. 14:18. Then, through the Prophet Moses, at the time God gave these rules to the people of Israel, it was determined that only Aaron's descendants could become priests, and many duties and rules were given to them in the books of Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy. Only the priests could enter the Holy Place, which was in the middle of the Tabernacle, and only they could handle the equipment that was there. Aaron came from the tribe of Levi. In the Rules of Moses, all male descendants of the tribe of Levi were appointed to become servants in God's Tabernacle, so that they could help in the affairs of God's Tabernacle. They couldn't function as priests, or perform specific ceremonies. At the time of King David, the priests were arranged into 24 groups— each of which took turns working in God's Temple for one month. At the time of Jesus, there was a council of priests. The members of that council were called ‘chief priests’. The head of the council was the high priest. Jesus is also called High Priest in the letter of Hebrews. (Heb. 5:5-6, 7:20-28, 8:1-2, 10:21) That's because Jesus is the greatest Mediator between man and God, and He made His people holy by Himself, being crucified as a sacrifice. Now every Christian can make requests directly to God when praying in the name of Jesus, and that's why every Christian is considered to be a ‘priest’ (1 Pet. 2:9, Rev. 1:6).\f* has made us at peace with God, through His own blood.\f + \fr 2:17 \fk the last sentence \ft Literally, “so that peace could be made for the sins of the people.” The words “made peace” are a special term, which in its root form encompasses the sacrifice to erase sin, so that God is no longer angry with the person who committed that sin. There is implicit information in this verse that was made explicit by the TSI translation team, so that today's readers could understand the role of the priest in the Jewish religious sacrificial system. This becomes important in chapter eight.\f*
\v 18 And because He Himself has suffered and was tempted, He understands our weaknesses, and is able to help us who're so often tempted.
