\s Jesus is far greater than Moses
\p
\v 1-2 So Brothers and Sisters, since God has chosen us to become citizens of heaven, let's get to know Jesus, whom we already acknowledge, better. He's the one who became God's representative\f + \fr 3:1 \fk God's representative \ft Literally, “apostle”— which also can be translated as “messenger.”\f* and our High Priest in this world. In carrying out His task, Jesus serves faithfully— just as Moses also had served faithfully in carrying out his task as leader of the people of Israel.
\v 3 But Jesus is more worthy to be honored than Moses. Moses can be illustrated as a caretaker in a big family, whereas Jesus is like the Head who built that family.
\v 4 Of course, if there's a family, there's also a head who built the family, but the Master Builder of all things is God.
\v 5 So as a caretaker, Moses was faithful in his ministry to the family of God, of course. And Moses' ministry illustrates what God would do and teach us later on through Christ.
\v 6 But Christ is the firstborn Son, who's faithful, and has full responsibility over God's family. And each of us are included as members of His family— if we keep holding firmly to our faith, and keep boldly witnessing about our hope.
\s How to enter God's “land of calm”
\p
\v 7 For that reason, remember what the Holy Spirit said in the Holy Bible,
\q1 “Today, when each of you hears the Lord's voice,
\q2
\v 8 don't harden your hearts like your forefathers did,
\q2 when they went too far in opposing Me, and tested My patience while they were traveling in the desert.
\q1
\v 9 Even though they had already seen the many miracles that I did in the desert for forty years,
\q2 they still kept testing Me and My patience.
\q1
\v 10 So I was really angry at all of them
\q2 and said, ‘Their hearts always want to follow the path that leads astray.
\q2 They always refuse to be obey My commands.’
\q1
\v 11 Because they made Me so angry, I swore,
\q2 ‘They'll never enter the land of calm\f + \fr 3:11 \fk land of calm \ft The writer of the Psalms reminds the readers about God's promise that the people of Israel would enter the land promised to Abraham and his descendants— which was the land of Canaan. But the writer of the Letter to the Hebrews used this verse with a spiritual meaning. To the writer, ‘the land of calm’ was 1) living calmly in the protection of God in this world, and 2) instead of trying to save one's self, it's better to hold on firmly to Jesus, in order to become a citizen of God's kingdom in heaven.\f* which I've prepared for them.’”\x + Ps. 95:7-11\x*
\p
\v 12 So Brothers and Sisters, be on guard so that none of you have evil hearts and refuse to believe, so that it makes you stop obeying the living God.
\v 13 But let's encourage each other everyday. God's Word, which was mentioned, began with, “Today.” So everyday, while it can still be called ‘today’, let's be careful so that none of us hardens our hearts because of being deceived by our own sins.
\v 14 For we've become friends in Christ's battle if we keep holding onto our faith until the end of our lives— just like when we first believed in Him.
\v 15 This is in agreement with God's Word, which I quoted earlier,
\q1 “Today, while each of you hears My voice,
\q2 don't harden your hearts like your forefathers did,
\q2 when they went too far in opposing Me.”\x + Ps. 95:7-8; Heb. 3:7-8\x*
\p
\v 16 Who heard God's voice and kept opposing Him? It was all of our forefathers, who were led out of Egypt by Moses!
\v 17 And who was God very angry at for forty years? It was with our forefathers who had sinned! That's why their dead bodies were scattered all along the road in the desert.
\v 18 Then whom did God mean when He swore, “They'll never enter the land of calm which I've prepared for them?” Yes, it was those who refused to obey Him.
\v 19 So it's clear that our forefathers weren't permitted to enter that land because they refused to believe in God.
