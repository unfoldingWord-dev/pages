\v 1 So let's be on guard with feelings of fear, because God's promise regarding the opportunity to enter that ‘land of calm today’\f + \fr 4:1 \fk land of calm \ft See the note in Heb. 3:11.\f* is still valid for us! For that reason, none of us should fail to take that opportunity!
\v 2 For we received the Good News about the way of salvation at first, just like our forefathers. Of course, they had heard that news from God, but it didn't help them, because they didn't completely believe that news.
\v 3 So we who believe are invited to enter now\f + \fr 4:3 \fk enter now \ft The verb in the Greek language isn't in future tense. If that were so, the meaning of this verse would only be for heaven. The verb in the Greek language is like “now entering.” Obviously, we experience this calmness in the world now, and also later on in heaven.\f* and have amazing calmness in God's protection. So we aren't like the people of Israel who failed to take this calmness— like God said,
\q1 “Because they made Me so angry, I swore,
\q2 ‘They'll never enter the land of calm which I've prepared for them.’”\x + Ps. 95:11; Heb. 3:11\x*
\m He spoke like that, even though that land of calm had already been made, because everything that God made had been ready since the creation of this world.
\v 4 We already know that because God had said in the Holy Bible,
\q “And on the seventh day God rested from all of His work in creating everything.”\x + Gen. 2:2\x*
\v 5 But in another verse it's written about that, “They'll never enter the land of calm which I've prepared for them.”\x + Ps. 95:11; Heb. 3:11\x*
\p
\v 6 So that land is still open, and we still have the opportunity to enter there. But our forefathers, who first heard that Good News, failed to enter because they refused to believe in God.
\v 7 Because of that, God determined yet another day as an opportunity to enter into that land. That's the verse which I quoted from Psalms above which says, ‘today’— where after many years God spoke about that day through King David,
\q1 “Today, if you hear My voice,
\q2 don't harden your hearts like your forefathers did.”\x + Ps. 95:7-8; Heb. 3:7-8, 3:13, 4:1\x*
\m
\v 8 For if Joshua\f + \fr 4:8 \fk Joshua \ft After Moses died, Joshua became the leader of the Jews. Joshua is the one who brought the people of Israel into the land of Canaan— the land which God had promised to them.\f* alone had really succeeded in bringing the people of Israel into the ‘land of calm’ which was promised by God, then God wouldn't have needed to determine yet another opportunity to enter that land!
\v 9 So this shows that there's still an opportunity for us, the people of God, to enter God's “land of calm”— which is a spiritual calmness that can be illustrated as when we stop working on the Sabbath Day.
\v 10 Everyone who enters that land, rests from all of all their own work,\f + \fr 4:10 \fk rests from all their own work \ft The meaning of the writer can be compared with Eph. 2:6, 2:8-10.\f* just like God, until now, still rests from all of His work, since the very first seventh day.
\v 11 For that reason, let's be all the more zealous and industrious to enter and live in that ‘land of calm’. Don't let any of us fail, like our forefathers did, who refused to believe in God.
\p
\v 12 Oh, God's Word truly lives and is powerful! For we experience that His Word has great power in us. That power is sharper than the sharpest two-edged sword. God's Word is so very powerful that it can pierce our hearts\f + \fr 4:12 \fk pierce our hearts \ft Literally, “pierce even to dividing between soul and spirit (and) joints and marrow, and judges thoughts …” The author of Hebrews uses the body parts ‘joints and marrow’ as a figure of speech which symbolizes very precise or deep distinctions in our consciences and in our spiritual lives.\f* — so that the thoughts, desires, and true intentions of our hearts are revealed to us.
\v 13 And remember: There's no creature that can hide itself from God. Everything is seen clearly by God— even all that's in our hearts is open before Him. And each of us will stand and give an account to Him.
\s Jesus is very fitting in His duty as High Priest for us
\p
\v 14 So we're very fortunate because Jesus, God's Son, has gone before us to heaven— where He has the duty as our High Priest.\f + \fr 4:14 \fk High Priest \ft See note in Heb. 2:17.\f* For that reason, let's keep holding on firmly to Jesus— according to our faith that we acknowledge.
\v 15 For even though our High Priest is in heaven, He can sympathize with all of our weaknesses, because He has lived in this world, and experienced every kind of trial that we experience. But He never sinned.
\v 16 For that reason, we can approach God's throne directly in prayer. And we may come without fear, because our High Priest is already next to His throne— where we'll be received by God's kindness. In that way, whenever we need help, God will have compassion and show the kindness of His heart to us.
