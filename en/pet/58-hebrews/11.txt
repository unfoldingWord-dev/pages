\s Heroes of the faith
\p
\v 1 By ‘completely believing’ I mean being certain that we'll surely receive what we hope for from God— even though we don't yet see it.
\v 2 For by completely believing, our forefathers became pleasing in God's eyes.
\p
\v 3 By completely believing we understand that by His word alone, God created everything that's on earth and in the heavens. So everything that we can see came from things that we can't see.
\p
\v 4 Because Abel believed completely in God, he offered a sacrifice that was better than the sacrifice offered by Cain. For that reason, God was pleased with Abel, and accepted him as a righteous person. So even though Abel is long dead, yet he's still an example for us because of his faith.
\p
\v 5 It's the same with Enoch: Because he believed completely, he was taken up to heaven without experiencing death. As it's written in the Holy Bible, “He suddenly disappeared, because he was taken up by God.”\x + Gen. 5:24\x* For before he was taken up, he was known as a person whose life always pleased God.
\v 6 It's clear that without completely believing, we can't possibly please Him, because everyone who wants to come to Him must believe that God really exists, and that He blesses everyone who sincerely seeks Him.
\p
\v 7 Noah is another example: He believed completely when God told about things that had never been seen by man. Because Noah believed and respected God, he built a ship to save his family. And because by completely believing, he proved that the people of the world at that time were wrong, God accepted him as a righteous person.
\p
\v 8 And the faith of Abraham is also an example: He believed God completely when he was told to go to another land— that is the land that God promised to give him and his descendants as an inheritance. Then by believing completely he left, even though he didn't yet know where he should go.
\v 9 Because he believed completely, he endured life as a foreigner in the land which God promised he would possess. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob just lived there in tents, and they inherited the same promise together.
\v 10 It's obvious that Abraham was waiting for a city that was planned and built by God, so that he would become a resident of that city— that is a city whose foundation will never be shaken.
\p
\v 11 The faith of Abraham also became an example when Sarah would give birth to Isaac. Even though they were already old and Sarah was barren, yet God made Sarah able to get pregnant so that they would have a descendant. This happened because Abraham believed completely that God is faithful, and would keep His promises.
\v 12 So because just one man— Abraham, believed completely when he was old and almost dead, “his descendants are countless— like the stars in the sky or the sand on the sea shore.”
\p
\v 13 All of those people mentioned believed completely until death. Even though they hadn't yet seen what God had promised them, it was as if they saw its shadow in the distance, and welcomed those things by believing completely. Then they became aware and acknowledged that they were just like guests and foreigners on this earth.
\v 14 In speaking like that, it's clear that they waited for a homeland which would become their own possession.
\v 15 What they were talking about wasn't the land that they had left, for if they had missed that land, they had many opportunities to return there.
\v 16 What they were longing for was a land— the land of heaven, which is far better than that land. So God has prepared a city for them, and He's happy to be called their God.
\p
\v 17 Abraham also became an example when his faith was tested by God— that is when God ordered him to offer up Isaac. Abraham believed completely, then willingly sacrificed his only son (by Sarah)— even though Abraham had received God's promises,
\v 18 including this promise:
\q1 “Only Isaac's descendants will be your descendants before Me.”\x + Gen. 21:12; Rom. 9:7\x*
\m
\v 19 Even so, he was willing to sacrifice Isaac, because he believed completely that God had the power to bring his son back to life from death. And actually, when God said, “Don't kill him,” it was like Abraham received Isaac back to life from death.
\p
\v 20 And Isaac also believed completely that God would fulfill His promises in times to come. Because of that he remembered those promises when he blessed Jacob and Esau.
\v 21 And Jacob also believed completely when he was already very old and almost dead, when he placed his hands on the heads of Joseph's two sons and blessed them. Then he praised God while leaning on the tip of his cane.
\v 22 Joseph also believed completely in the same way. When he was almost dead, he reminded the family of Israel about God's promise to take them out of Egypt, and he ordered that his body be brought out at a later time too.
\p
\v 23 Moses' parents are also examples of people who believed: They believed completely in God, and because of that they weren't afraid to break the king's law. After Moses was born, they hid him for three months. They were aware that God had given them an unusual son.
\p
\v 24 Then Moses himself was also an example of people who believed completely: For when he was an adult, he refused to be called the daughter of King Pharoah's son.
\v 25 He thought it was better to be tortured and be in trouble with the people of God, than to live a pleasant life of sin in the king's palace. He was aware that a pleasant life like that was just temporary.
\v 26 By believing completely, he waited for a future time— when Christ would come to save the people of Israel. Because of that, he considered it was far more worthwhile to be persecuted for Christ's sake than to have all the riches of Egypt. He felt it was far better to wait for the reward that God would give Him.
\v 27 And because Moses believed completely in God, he dared to leave Egypt. He wasn't afraid of the anger of the Pharoah, but with his eyes firmly focused ahead, he walked as if seeing the invisible God.
\v 28 And also because of that faith, Moses held the first Passover Day, by sprinkling blood on all the doors of the houses of the people of Israel, so that every house of the Israelites was protected from the angel who would kill the firstborn sons.
\p
\v 29 The people of Israel are also examples of people who believed completely: Because of their faith, they could cross the Red Sea— as if passing through on dry land. But the soldiers of Egypt drowned when they tried to cross it.
\p
\v 30 They believed completely. Because of that, after they had walked around outside the walls of Jericho for seven days, the city walls fell down.
\p
\v 31 And because Rahab the prostitute believed completely in God, she received the two spies of Israel who spied on their region, and helped them. For that reason, she wasn't destroyed along with all the residents of that city who refused to believe in God.
\p
\v 32 And there is still much more that I could tell, but there isn't enough time to tell about Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel, and the prophets!
\v 33 They also believed completely. Because of that they were given power to snatch lands from the power of foreign kings, and some among them were given power to rule with justice over their enemies, others received what God promised them, and some others were protected by Him so that they weren't eaten by lions.
\v 34 Some of the others escaped the danger of great fire,\f + \fr 11:34 \fk escaped the danger of great fire \ft Literally, “quenched the power of fire.” The TSI (and PET) are translated according to the interpretation that these words are a figure of speech referring to the story of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in Dan. 3.\f* others were protected from wars, and there were those who were very weak, who were given amazing strength. There were also those of them who became heroes in war, and there were only a few soldiers of Israel, but they defeated the enemy's troops, and then the enemies ran away.
\v 35 Also because they believed completely in God, several women experienced miracles where members of their families came back to life from death.
\p But there are also examples of other people who believed completely: There were those who were constantly tortured in prison. The people who tortured each of them said, “Insult your god and we'll release you!” But they refused to be set free, because they believed completely that as a result of their faithfulness, they would be brought back to a far better life from death, for sure.
\v 36 And among them were also those who kept enduring when their faith was tested— even though they were insulted and almost beaten to death, or left in prison, being bound with iron chains.
\v 37-38 Among those believers there were also those stoned to death, those whose bodies were cut in two with a saw, and those who were killed with the sword. And among them, there were those who were so poor that they didn't have a place to live, and only had the clothes on their backs which were made of sheep or goat skin. They had little food, were made to suffer, and were tortured continually. People like that were too good to live in this world, so they lived just like nomads— either in the desert, or on the mountains, and were forced to live in caves, or in holes underground.
\p
\v 39 Now those people have become good examples for us, because it's proven that they believed completely in God. Even though they died before receiving what God had promised them, God was still pleased with them because of their faith.
\v 40 For the plan of God isn't just for them, but it's for us too. God determined that it was better for them to wait for us, and when our faith has finally been tested and is perfected, only then will all of us receive the amazing blessing that is prepared for us!
