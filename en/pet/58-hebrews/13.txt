\s The way of life that pleases God's heart
\p
\v 1 You should always love each other as brothers and sisters in the faith.
\v 2 Remember this: The doors of all your homes should be frequently open to people who need a place to stay. For in doing that— without being aware of it, some people have received angels into their homes!
\v 3 And don't forget to pray for, and help our brothers and sisters in the faith who're now imprisoned. Do it as if you yourself were also suffering with them in that prison, and sympathize with the troubles of our brothers and sisters in the faith who're now suffering— as if you were also suffering like them.
\p
\v 4 All of us should value the relationship of our marriages as something that's holy, and the sexual relationship of husband and wife should be guarded so that it's kept pure, because God will punish everyone who commits immorality or adultery.
\v 5 Let's not allow our lives to be contolled by money. Instead, we should be satisfied with what we have, for God says,
\q1 “I'll never neglect you,
\q2 I'll never leave you alone.”\x + Deut. 31:6\x*
\m
\v 6 So as it's written in Psalms, we can say with certainty,
\q1 “The Lord is my Helper!
\q2 I won't be afraid.
\q1 People who oppose me can't do anything to me.”\x + Ps. 118:7\x*
\p
\v 7 Remember our leaders who delivered God's Word to us, and who've gone before us to heaven. Meditate on their good way of life, and imitate their faith.
\v 8 Christ Jesus never changes— past, present and forever.
\p
\v 9 Let's not be led astray by people who bring all kinds of other teachings. It's better if your heart is encouraged because of depending on God's kindness, than to follow those who're busy with many rules about food, for no one has ever succeeded in becoming perfect in the eyes of God, by following rules like that.
\p
\v 10 In the old system of sacrifices, the priests could eat two pieces of meat from the animal sacrifices, whereas in the new system, we're blessed through the heavenly altar, and the priests who serve in God's earthly Temple don't have the right to eat anything from that altar.
\v 11 But it can be said that the new system resembles the old system. For with the sacrifice of forgiveness for sin, none of the meat was eaten by the priests. After the high priest brought the blood of that animal into the Most Holy Room— which is the blood of forgiveness for sin, then all the body parts of that animal were completely burned to ashes in another place, outside of the camp of the people of Israel— not on the altar in the Lord's Tabernacle.
\v 12 In a similar way, Jesus suffered outside the city of Jerusalem, so that we're purified by His own blood, and become His people.
\v 13 For that reason, let's go to Jesus outside of the city walls in a spiritual way.\f + \fr 13:13 \fk city walls \ft Literally, “camp.” The writer of the Letter to the Hebrews uses this word figuratively, which reminds the reader of the history of the Israelites before God's Temple was in Jerusalem.\f*By that I mean, let's not be ashamed to leave the old Jewish rules, and let's consider it an honor if we're insulted just because of following Jesus.
\v 14 For in this world, we don't have a city that lasts forever, but we're waiting for the new Jerusalem.
\v 15 So through Jesus, let's always give spiritual offerings to God— that is, we should praise God through all our words, and tell that Jesus is our Lord with boldness.
\v 16 And let's not forget to do good things to other people and help each other, because that's also an offering that pleases God.
\p
\v 17 We should respect and obey our leaders in the faith because God has given them the duty to guard each of our lives spiritually, and they know that they're responsible to give an account to God later on. So always respect and obey them, so that they can do their duties with glad hearts. For if they work with sad hearts, that certainly won't bring us blessing.
\p
\v 18 Keep praying for me, and for everyone who works with me, because we're sure that our consciences aren't guilty, and we always try to do what's right.
\v 19 And I especially request that you pray for me, that God will soon send me back to you.
\s Prayer of blessing and final words
\p
\q1
\v 20-21 May God—
\q2 who is He that always guards us so that we live with feelings of calm,
\q2 and who raised our Lord Jesus from death,
\q1 equip you with everything that you need to do His will.
\q1 And may God, through the help of Christ Jesus—
\q2 our Great Shepherd, who made the new promise with God valid
\q2 through the sacrifice of His own blood,
\q1 enable you to do everything that pleases God.
\q1 Give glory to Him forever and ever. Amen.
\p
\v 22 Brothers and Sisters, I ask that you listen patiently to my advise in this letter when it's read in the church, because this letter isn't too long.
\v 23 I want you to know that our brother, Timothy, was set free from prison. If he comes here soon, the two of us will visit you.
\p
\v 24 Give my greetings to all your leaders, and to all our brothers and sisters in the faith— that is to everyone who has been purified by the Lord. And all the brothers and sisters in the faith in Italy send greetings to you.
\p
\v 25 I pray that God will always be kind to each of you.
