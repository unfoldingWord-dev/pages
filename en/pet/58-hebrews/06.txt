\v 1 So, because you need teachings that lead you to spiritual maturity, I don't want to repeat the basic teachings about Christ to you again. Let's rise now to higher teachings, so I won't repeat these basic teachings
\q1 about repenting of all kinds of deeds which actually lead you to spiritual death,\f + \fr 6:1 \fk deeds … spiritual death \ft Literally, “dead deeds.” The author of the Letter to the Hebrews used the same expression in 9:14. About fifty percent of commentators say that what was intended is keeping the old rules of the Jewish religion. In this interpretation “dead deeds” can be understood as ‘useless deeds’. (See 2 Cor. 3:6 and Gal. 4:8-12, and the footnote for verse 10.) Other commentators say that writer's intent is repentance from all kinds of evil deeds. And evil deeds also bring us to spiritual death, of course.\f*
\q1 about believing in God,
\q1
\v 2 about the differences between the baptism of the Jewish religion, John's baptism, and baptism as Christ's followers,
\q1 about various blessings done by laying on hands,\f + \fr 6:2 \fk various blessings … laying on hands \ft It's likely that what's intended are teachings about various blessings that were normally only done by church leaders, by placing their hands on someone involved— including a blessing for baptism, a blessing to ask for anointing or spiritual gifts from God's Spirit, blessings when one became an elder, deacon, or a messenger from the church, and all kinds of general blessings— for example healing of the sick.\f*
\q1 about our belief that people who've died will live again,
\q1 and about the eternal punishment which God will give to everyone who does evil.
\m
\v 3 So with God's help, let me give a higher lesson that can make us spiritually mature!
\p
\v 4-6 Watch out! Don't let anyone go back to living in darkness! For we can't possibly lead a person like that back to repentance, like when he first followed Christ. A person like that has already felt God's kindness, which he received through Jesus, and he has also experienced the Holy Spirit's help. He has also experienced how beautiful the Good News from God is, and experienced the spiritual abilities that we'll enjoy in the age to come. So if a person like that leaves Christ, he can't possibly repent again. For when he leaves Christ, in the eyes of many people, it's as if he has trampled on God's Son. If a person like that tries to repent again, it's as if he's asking Christ, “Jesus, please die on the cross again for me to pay for the sins that I committed after I left You!”
\p
\v 7 Our spiritual lives can be illustrated by a field. For if by God's kindness a field gets plenty of rain, then becomes fertile and produces many plants for the farmers, then God will continue to bless that field.
\v 8 However, if that field only produces weeds and thorny plants, then that field will be considered useless. And in the end, that field will be cursed by God, then burned.
\p
\v 9 My beloved Brothers and Sisters, don't be disappointed! Even though I've written these heavy things to you, I'm certain that you aren't people who'll leave Jesus, but are included with us who're being saved.
\v 10 For God is just. He'll keep remembering what each of you has done for Him, especially when you show love to brothers and sisters in the faith, in order to glorify God. He notices how you've often served them, and still continue to serve them until now, and He'll never forget to bless you.
\v 11 But what I really long for is that you stay inspired and keep doing visible acts of love to the end of your life, because in that way you'll make certain that you'll receive what we hope for in heaven.
\v 12 In that way, you won't become a lazy person either. But you should follow the example of the brothers and sisters in the faith who've gone to heaven ahead of us. Notice how they remained patient and completely believed in Christ until the end of their lives. Think of how they're now enjoying all of God's promises.
\s God will never break a promise
\p
\v 13-15 Abraham is an example for us. God promised him by ‘swearing by Himself’, when God said,
\q “I swear by My own self: … I sincerely promise to bless you and give you many descendants.”\x + Gen. 22:16-17\x*
\m Then, after Abraham waited with complete faith and patience, he also received what was promised by Him. And this is why he could be certain of God's promise: God strengthened His promise by “swearing by Himself.” For of course, there's no one greater than God, so that's the reason He strengthened His promise by naming Himself.
\p
\v 16 We know that people always swear by calling on the name of a person who has more authority, and usually call on the name of God. And if he swears before a court by calling on the name of God, that means God will punish that person if he lies, so his testimony is considered legitimate.
\v 17 In the same way, when God wanted to strengthen the truth of His promise, He strengthened His promise with an oath. For God wants us spiritual descendants of Abraham to be aware of this, “What God promised us will be fulfilled, for sure.”
\v 18 So God has given His promise and His oath. Both of those things can't possibly be changed by Him, because God can't possibly lie. For that reason, we who depend\f + \fr 6:18 \fk depend \ft Literally, “run away (from danger and) hold on to.” As an illustration of this expression, several times in the Old Testament, men who were under threat of the death sentence fled to God's Temple and held onto the corners of the altar— which were shaped like bull's horns. (See 1 Kings 1:50 and 2:28, or compare with Ps. 61:3 (61:4 in the Indonesian Bible) and Pro. 18:10.)\f*completely on God's kindness to save us, feel encouraged by hoping like this, “God will fulfill all of His promises to us, for sure!”
\v 19-20 May our hope function like a strong and safe anchor for us, so that we're strengthened and not carried away by any current. For our Hope is really Jesus Himself, who has opened the way into the Most Holy Room in God's Temple in heaven for us. So now we can approach Him there directly, in prayer, because Jesus has been given the duty as High Priest for us forever, according to the pattern of the Priest Melchizedek.
