\s Jesus is our High Priest
\p
\v 1 So the main point of all I wrote above is that our High Priest sits in the place of greatest honor next to the throne of God Almighty in heaven.
\v 2 He also serves there in the most holy worship center\f + \fr 8:2 \fk most holy worship center \ft Literally, “holy (places).” The word that's used here is different than what's used for the Holy Room and the Most Holy Room in Heb. 9:3-4. Because it's plural, it's interpreted that the whole complex of God's Tabernacle is intended.\f* — that's in the true Tabernacle of the Lord. That Tabernacle was set up by God Himself in heaven — not the old tabernacle that was made by human hands.
\p
\v 3 Of course, every high priest has the duty to offer various kinds of gifts and sacrifices to God. It's the same with our High Priest: He had to have something to offer.
\v 4 If Jesus still lived on this earth, he couldn't possibly have been appointed to become a priest, because there are already people from a different tribe who serve all of the offerings according to the Law.
\v 5 But God's earthly Tabernacle, where the earthly priests served, was only a picture or shadow of the real Tabernacle of the Lord in heaven. Notice that before Moses built the Lord's first Tabernacle, God ordered him,
\q1 “You must make everything exactly the same as the example that I showed you up on the mountain.”\x + Ex. 25:40\x*
\m
\v 6 But now Jesus has been given a ministry that's far more glorious than the ministry of the earthly priests, because He has become the Mediator who manages the new promise between God and us. And that new promise is far more glorious than the old promise, because God has promised better things— like what I'll go on to explain.
\p
\v 7 If the former promise that was made through Moses as mediator had been satisfactory, then a second promise wouldn't have been needed.
\v 8-10 But God Himself wasn't satisfied with the old promise, so He said to the people of Israel,
\q1 “This is the word of the Lord: In days to come,
\q2 I'll set up a new promise
\q2 with you people of Judah, and with all the people of Israel.
\q1 The new promise isn't the same as what I set up with your forefathers,
\q2 when I had compassion on them, and with My own hand
\q2 led them out of Egypt.
\q1 But they didn't keep living according to all the rules of that promise,
\q2 so I took My hands off them.
\q1 But this is the new promise which I'll later set up with you, the people of Israel:
\q1 I'll put My law in your minds,
\q2 and I'll write My law on your hearts.
\q1 Then I'll become your God,
\q2 and you'll become My people.
\q1
\v 11 For that reason, you won't need to remind each of the brothers in the faith later on
\q2 like this, ‘Know the Lord’,
\q1 because all of you— great or small, will truly know Me.
\q1
\v 12 For I'll forgive all of your evil with great compassion,
\q2 and won't remember your sins anymore.”\x + Jer. 31:31-34\x*
\p
\v 13 So because God spoke about a new promise, it's clear that the promise made with Moses as mediator was considered outdated. This means that the old promise won't be valid anymore.
