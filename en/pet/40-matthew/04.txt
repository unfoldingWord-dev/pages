\c 4
\s Jesus is tempted by the devil
\r (Mark 1:12-13; Luke 4:1-13)
\p
\v 1 After that, Jesus was led by the Holy Spirit into the desert, to be tempted by the devil.
\v 2 And He didn't eat anything for forty days and forty nights, and he was finally very hungry.
\v 3 Then the tempter— who is the devil, approached Him and said, “You're God's Son\f + \fr 4:3 \fk God's Son \ft Before Jesus was born on this earth, God had announced in Ps.2:7, “You're My Son. Today I proclaim that I'm Your Father.” The writer of the Letter to the Hebrews in the New Testament states (in Heb. 1:5) that this verse is about Jesus. And before Jesus was born, the angel Gabriel told Mary (in Luke 1:35), “The Holy Spirit will come to you, and the power of the Most High will come upon you, so that the holy Child whom you give birth to will be called God's Son.” So God Himself is the one who told that Jesus was His Son before He was born on this earth, and we call Him 'God's Son' in agreement with God's Word. And from Luke 1:35, it's clear that Mary conceived Jesus, not because of a sexual relationship with God or man, but because of the power of the Holy Spirit.(John 4:24).\f* — right?! Make these stones become bread!”
\p
\v 4 But Jesus answered, “It's written in the Holy Bible,
\q1 ‘The life of man doesn't depend only on bread,\f + \fr 4:4 \fk depend only on bread \ft In the land of Palestine and all of the kingdom of Rome, the main food was bread. So in Indonesia, bread can be compared to rice.\f*
\q2 but it depends on every word that's expressed by God.’”\x + Deut.8:3\x*
\p
\v 5 Then in just a short time, the devil took Him to the holy city of Jerusalem and placed Him on top of God's Temple.
\v 6 So he said to Him, “If you\f + \fr 4:6 \fk you \ft Even though the devil knew that Jesus was God's Son, 'you' with a lower case letter is used, because the devil didn't respect Him as he should.\f* are God's Son, jump down! For it's written in the Holy Bible,
\q1 ‘God will order the angels to protect you,’
\q2 and ‘their hands will hold you,
\q1 so that your foot won't even hit a stone.’”\x + Ps. 91:11-12\x*
\p
\v 7 Jesus answered, “It's also written,
\q1 ‘Don't tempt the Lord your God.’”\x + Deut.6:16\x*
\p
\v 8 Then in a miraculous way the devil took Him to the top of a very high mountain, and showed Him all the kingdoms on earth, and all the splendor of each of those kingdoms.
\v 9 So he said to Jesus, “I'll give all of this to you if you bow down and worship me.”
\p
\v 10 Jesus said to him, “Hey Satan,\f + \fr 4:10 \fk Satan \ft “Satan” is a name for the devil, which is written in the Greek language in this verse. The name Satan comes from the Hebrew language, and means ‘adversary’.\f* go away! For it's written in the Holy Bible,
\q1 ‘Worship the Lord your God,
\q2 and serve Him only.’”\x + Deut.6:13\x*
\p
\v 11 Then the devil left Jesus, and the angels came and served Him.
\s Jesus begins His ministry in Galilee
\r (Mark 1:14-15; Luke 4:14-15)
\p
\v 12 When Jesus heard that John had been imprisoned, He left the province of Judea and returned to the province of Galilee.
\v 13 He didn't stay in Nazareth anymore, but in the city of Capernaum (on the shore of Lake Galilee)— which is the region of Zebulun and Naphtali.
\v 14 Jesus did this so that what was prophesied by the Prophet Isaiah would be fulfilled,
\q1
\v 15 “Listen, you who live in the area of Zebulun and Naphtali,
\q2 which is the region along the road toward the sea,
\q2 and as far as the other side of the Jordan River.
\q2 That region is called Galilee— where many non-Jewish people live.
\q1
\v 16 Those who live in darkness,
\q2 will see a great light.
\q1 Like when the sun rises, the light has risen on those
\q2 who live in a region that's dark and dangerous because it's controlled by the kingdom of death.”\x + Is.9:1-2\x*
\p
\v 17 From that day on, Jesus told this message to the crowd, “Repent of your sins, for God will come to set up His kingdom on this earth not long from now.”
\s Jesus chooses His disciples
\r (Mark 1:16-20; Luke 5:1-11)
\p
\v 18 While Jesus was walking along the shore of Lake Galilee, He saw two fishermen— who were Simon who is also called Peter and Andrew, his younger brother. They were catching fish in the lake.
\v 19 He said to them, “Come and follow Me. Your work will no longer be fishermen, but I'll teach you to catch people so that they become My followers.”
\v 20 At that very moment, Simon and Andrew immediately left their nets and followed Jesus.
\p
\v 21 When He had walked a little farther from there, He saw two other brothers— who were James and his younger brother John. They were in a boat with Zebedee, their father, and were repairing their nets. Then Jesus called James and John to follow Him.
\v 22 At that very moment also, the two of them immediately left the boat and their father, and followed Jesus.
\s Jesus teaches and heals
\p
\v 23 Then Jesus went through the whole province of Galilee and taught in the Jewish synagogues,\f + \fr 4:23 \fk Jewish synagogues \ft Synagogue is a Greek word. In New Testament times, the synagogues were used for general meetings for the local Jewish people, and were also used as places for Jewish people to pray and study God's Word. The synagogues were different from God's Temple— which was in Jerusalem. The offering of burned sacrifices was only done in God's Temple, whereas synagogues were built in every city or village where the Jews lived.\f* and told the Good News about God's kingdom. He also healed every kind of sickness they had.
\v 24 News about Him spread widely from Galilee, through the whole province of Syria. So they brought many sick people to Him. The people were suffering from all kinds of diseases— including those possessed by evil spirits, those sick with seizures, and those who were completely paralyzed. Then all of them were healed by Him.
\v 25 For that reason, many people followed Him. There were those who came from the provinces of Galilee, Judea, Ten Cities province,\f + \fr 4:25 \fk Ten Cities \ft See the footnote about Decapolis at Mrk. 5:10.\f* and also the city of Jerusalem, and even from across the Jordan River.
