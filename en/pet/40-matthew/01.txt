\s List of the forefathers of Christ Jesus
\r (Luke 3:23-38)
\p
\v 1 This is the list of the forefathers of Christ Jesus. He came from the descendants of David, who was a descendant of Abraham.
\li
\v 2 Abraham was the father of Isaac,
\li Isaac was the father of Jacob,
\li Jacob was the father of Judah and his brothers.
\li
\v 3 Judah was the father of Perez and Zerah, and their mother was named Tamar.
\li Perez was the father of Hezron.
\li Hezron was the father of Ram.
\li
\v 4 Ram was the father of Amminadab.
\li Amminadab was the father of Nahshon.
\li Nahshon was the father of Salmon.
\li
\v 5 Salmon was the father of Boaz, and Rahab was his mother.
\li Boaz was the father of Obed, and Ruth was his mother.
\li Obed was the father of Jesse.
\li
\v 6 Jesse was the father of King David.
\li David was the father of Solomon, and the mother of Solomon was the former wife of Uriah.
\li
\v 7 Solomon was the father of Rehoboam.
\li Rehoboam was the father of Abijah.
\li Abijah was the father of Asa.
\li
\v 8 Asa was the father of Jehoshaphat.
\li Jehoshaphat was the father of Joram.
\li Joram was the father of Uzziah.
\li
\v 9 Uzziah was the father of Jotham.
\li Jotham was the father of Ahaz.
\li Ahaz was the father of Hezekiah.
\li
\v 10 Hezekiah was the father of Manasseh.
\li Manasseh was the father of Amos.
\li Amos was the father of Josiah.
\li
\v 11 Josiah was the father of Jechoniah\f + \fr 1:11 \fk Jechoniah \ft His other name was Jehoiachin.\f* and his brothers. At that time, many Jewish people were taken as prisoners of war to the land of Babylon.
\li
\v 12 While the Jewish people were still prisoners of war in Babylon:
\li Jeconiah was the father of Shealtiel.
\li Shealtiel was the father of Zerubbabel.
\li
\v 13 Zerubbabel was the father of Abiud.
\li Abiud was the father of Eliakim.
\li Eliakim was the father of Azor.
\li
\v 14 Azor was the father of Zadok.
\li Zadok was the father of Achim.
\li Achim was the father of Eliud.
\li
\v 15 Eliud was the father of Eleazar.
\li Eleazar was the father of Matthan.
\li Matthan was the father of Jacob.
\li
\v 16 Jacob was the father of Joseph.
\li Joseph was the husband of Mary,
\li and Mary was the mother of Jesus, who was called the Christ.\f + \fr 1:16 \fk Christ \ft is a word from the Greek language which means ‘anointed one’. In the Hebrew language, the same term is called ‘Messiah’. That term denotes a position, like ‘district head’ or ‘governor’. In Old Testament times, each king was anointed with olive oil by a prophet, as a sign of being chosen and confirmed by God. And all of the priests and prophets of that time were also anointed. It's appropriate to call Jesus ‘The Anointed One’, because He holds the position as a prophet, High King, and our High Priest (Heb. 4-10). Because of some of the prophecies in the books of the prophets and the Psalms, at the time of Jesus, the Jewish people in general knew the meaning of ‘Christ’ as the King of Salvation, whom God promised, who would come from the descendants of King David, and would free the nation of Israel from those who opposed them, set up a government with the power of God, and rule with justice. See Is. 9:5-6 [Indonesian verse numbering]; Gen. 3:15; Deut. 18:18-19; Mic. 5:2; Zec. 12:10-14; Mal. 3:1, 4:5-6; Ps. 2, 16, 22, 40, 110)\f*
\p
\v 17 So, there were fourteen descendants from Abraham to David, and fourteen descendants from David until the time the Jewish people were taken to Babylon. And from the time the Jewish people began to live in the land of Babylon until Christ was born, there were also fourteen descendants.
\s The birth of Christ Jesus
\r (Luke 2:1-7)
\p
\v 18 This is the story about the birth of Christ Jesus: A young woman named Mary was engaged to Joseph. Mary was the one who would later become Jesus' mother. But before they were married, it turned out that Mary got pregnant because of the power of the Holy Spirit.
\v 19 Joseph, Mary's fiance, was an honest and kind-hearted man. When Mary told Joseph about her pregnancy, he didn't want to shame Mary in public by saying that she had committed adultery. So, he planned to break off his engagement with Mary in a quiet way.
\p
\v 20 But while Joseph was thinking about that, an angel of the Lord came to him in a dream. The angel said, “Joseph, descendant of David, don't be afraid to take Mary as your wife, because the child that's in her womb came from the Holy Spirit.
\v 21 Mary will give birth to a boy Child, and you will name Him Jesus,\f + \fr 1:21 \fk Jesus \ft The name Jesus in the Greek language is the same as the name Joshua in the Hebrew language. Both names mean “the LORD saves.”\f* because He's the one who will save His people from their sins.”
\p
\v 22 God was obviously arranging all of these things to happen so that what God spoke through the word of His prophet would be fulfilled,
\q1
\v 23 “A virgin will conceive and give birth to a boy Child, and He'll be named Immanuel.”\x + Is.7:14\x*
\m (The name Immanuel means, “God is with us.”)
\v 24 So Joseph got up from his sleep and did what the angel of the Lord told him— that is to quickly marry Mary.
\v 25 However, Joseph didn't have sexual relations with Mary until the Child was born, and after He was born, Joseph named Him Jesus.
