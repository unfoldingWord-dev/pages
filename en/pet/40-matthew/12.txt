\s Jesus is the Lord over the Sabbath Day
\r (Mark 2:23-28; Luke 6:1-5)
\p
\v 1 On a certain Sabbath Day, Jesus and we disciples of His walked through a large field of wheat. Because we felt hungry, we began to pick some stalks of wheat and eat the grains.
\v 2 At that time, there were some Pharisees who saw what happened and said to Jesus, “Why're your disciples doing that? They're breaking the command about the Sabbath Day.”
\p
\v 3 But He answered them, “You know what happened, of course, when David and the people who were with him were hungry and needed food.
\v 4 He entered God's Holy Tabernacle and accepted the bread that was always placed in the Holy Room of God's Tabernacle. David took it to the people who were with him, and then he ate the bread with them. According to the rules of the Law, only the priests could eat it.\x + Lev. 24:9, 1 Sam. 21:1-6]\x* Even so, because they needed it, no one considers what David did to be sin.
\v 5 And as another example: You know, of course, that every Sabbath Day there are priests who work in God's Temple. That isn't considered to be an offense either.
\v 6 And I'm telling you that what God is doing now through Me\f + \fr 12:6 \fk what God is doing now through Me \fk Literally, “something.” According to the tradition of the Jews at that time, Jesus didn't directly say ‘Me’, but the people who heard Him knew that He was speaking about Himself. Jesus meant that just as the priests' ministry in God's Temple was considered to be more important than the rules of the Sabbath Day, His presence among them was also more important than His disciples eating wheat in a field on the Sabbath Day.\f* is more important than God's Temple!
\v 7 In the Holy Bible, God says, ‘Instead of sacrificing many animals to Me, I want you to show compassion to other people.’\x + Hos. 6:6\x* If you understood the meaning of that verse, you wouldn't blame My disciples, who weren't wrong, of course.
\v 8 For I, as the Son of Man, am the Lord who has the right to determine what may or may not be done on the Sabbath Day.”
\s Jesus heals a man's hand on the Sabbath day
\r (Mark 3:1-6; Luke 6:6-11)
\p
\v 9 Then Jesus left that place and entered one of the Jewish synagogues.
\v 10 And there was a man there who had one paralyzed hand. There were also some Pharisees there who wanted to find a reason to accuse Jesus, so they asked Him, “Is anyone allowed to heal a person on the Sabbath Day?”
\p
\v 11 Jesus answered them, “If one of your sheep falls into a hole on the Sabbath Day, won't you go quickly and try to get the sheep out of the hole? You wouldn't leave the sheep there, of course!
\v 12 People are much more valuable than sheep! For that reason, we're allowed to do good to a person, for sure— even if it's on the Sabbath Day.”
\p
\v 13 Then he said to th man, “Stretch out your hand.” So the man stretched out his paralyzed hand, and at that very moment, his hand was made well, just like his other normal hand!
\v 14 But the Pharisees went out of the synagogue and began to make plans to kill Jesus.
\s Jesus, the chosen servant of God
\p
\v 15 When Jesus knew what the Pharisees were planning, he left that place. But many people followed Him, and He healed everyone who was sick.
\v 16 But Jesus forbid them to tell other people about Him.
\v 17 He did those things on purpose so that the testimony of His ministry matched exactly this prophecy of the Prophet Isaiah about Him:
\q1
\v 18 “This is My servant, whom I've chosen.
\q1 I love Him, and He pleases My heart.
\q1 I'll give Him My Spirit,
\q2 and He'll tell people that God will judge all non-Jewish people with justice.
\q1
\v 19 He won't argue with other people, or oppose people with a harsh voice.
\q2 And He won't cause a commotion in the streets.
\q1
\v 20 He won't break the hopes\f + \fr 12:20 \fk break the hopes … \fk Literally, “He won't break a bamboo branch that's damaged, and He won't extinguish the wick (lamp) that has almost gone out.”\f* of weak people,
\q2 and He'll be gentle with people who've almost given up.
\q2 In that way, He'll keep fighting until He wins in every situation, and is proven to be just.
\q1
\v 21 Then people from all non-Jewish people groups will put their hope in Him.”\x + Is. 42:1-4\x*
\s According to the Pharisees, Jesus works with the power of the devil
\r (Mark 3:20-30; Luke 11:14-23, 12:10)
\p
\v 22 Then a man who was blind and mute, because he was possessed by a demon, was brought to Jesus, and Jesus healed the man so that he could see and speak.
\v 23 Everyone who witnessed it was really amazed and said, “Maybe this man is the Descendant of David who was promised.”\f + \fr 12:23 \fk Descendant of David… \fk See the note in Matt. 9:27.\f*
\p
\v 24 But when the Pharisees heard that, they said, “The devil— who's also called Beelzebul,\f + \fr 12:24 \fk Beelzebul \fk See the note in Matt. 10:24-25.\f* the one who leads all kinds of evil spirits, is the one who has given Jesus power so that he can drive out demons.”
\p
\v 25-26 But Jesus knew what the Pharisees were thinking, so He said to them, “It isn't possible that the devil would drive out spirits who're on the same side as he is. If the devil's cohorts are divided and oppose each other, his kingdom will be destroyed. It's the same for a certain country or city. If the residents of a certain country or city oppose each other and go to war, that country or city will be destroyed. The same is true if with division happens among family members.
\v 27 But if it's true that I drive out demons by the authority of the devil, that means we need to ask, ‘By whose authority do other members of the Pharisees drive out demons?’ Your members themselves will surely say that you're wrong.
\v 28 But if I drive out demons by the authority of God's Spirit, it shows that God has already begun to set up His kingdom among you with His authority.
\v 29 I'm here as an enemy of the devil, who came to take away his treasure. No one is brave enough just to enter the house of a very strong man in order to steal. But before he enters that strong man's house, he has to bind him first, and only then can he enter that house and steal his possessions.
\v 30 Whoever isn't on My side opposes Me. nd whoever doesn't help shepherd the flock of sheep, scatters them.
\p
\v 31 “For that reason, I'm telling you that God is ready to forgive people of every kind of sin, including the sin of insulting Him. But the person who insults God's Spirit\f + \fr 12:31 \fk insults God's Spirit \fk Jesus advises them against the sin of insulting God's Spirit because the Pharisees said, “Jesus works with the power of the devil.” (verse 24) Their hearts were so closed to Jesus that the good things He did by the power of God's Spirit were considered to be evil. It isn't possible for a person who thinks like that to repent. Thought that insult God's Spirit can be compared with 1 John 5:16— where John writes about “the sin which brings death,” that also can't be forgiven. But for Christians nowadays, we don't need to be afraid, thinking, “Have I ever insulted God's Spirit so that God won't forgive me?” If we still feel sad and ask for forgiveness when we fall into sin, and if we still want to live well in God's eyes, then it's clear that God's Spirit is still working in our hearts. If we're still willing to repent, it means we haven't yet committed the sin of insulting God's Spirit.\f* will never be forgiven.
\v 32 Everyone who insults the Son of Man— who I am, can be forgiven, but the person who insults the Holy Spirit, will never be forgiven— neither at this time or in time to come!”
\s We are known and will be judged by our own words
\r (Luke 6:43-45)
\p
\v 33 “Everyone knows that if you want to eat delicious fruit, you pick it from a tree that's good. Fruit from a tree that isn't good will definitely not be delicious, because every tree is evaluated by the fruit it produces.
\v 34 Hey you, descendants of poisonous snakes! How can you evil people possibly say things that are good?! For the words that come out of a person's mouth depend on the heart of that person.
\v 35 If a person is good, his heart is good too, so the words that come out of his mouth are also good. If a person is evil, his heart is evil too, so the words that come out of his mouth are also evil.
\v 36 But I'm telling you that on the Judgment Day, everyone will be responsible for every word that he has ever expressed— even what he said carelessly.
\v 37 When God judges all , every word that you've ever expressed will prove whether you'll be punished or made right.”
\s The miraculous sign that will be given to people in an evil age
\r (Mark 8:11-12; Luke 11:29-32)
\p
\v 38 On a certain day, some Pharisees and Law experts said to Jesus, “Teacher, we want to see you perform a miraculous sign as proof that you were sent by God.”
\p
\v 39 He answered them, “You're evil people who aren't faithful to God, and that's why you want to see a miraculous sign! But I won't give any miraculous sign to people like you, except for the miraculous sign that happened to the Prophet Jonah.\f + \fr 12:39 \fk Prophet Jonah The story about the Prophet Jonah is found in the book of Jonah, in the Old Testament. Jonah was sent by God to the city of Nineveh.\f*
\v 40 Just like Jonah was in the stomach of a big fish for three days and three nights, I— the Son of Man, will also be in the grave for three days and three nights before I'm resurrected.
\v 41 At the Judgment Day, the residents of the city of Ninevah will stand up and testify against each of you who're now living in this age. For at the time Jonah gave God's message to them, they repented. But even though I'm here and I'm greater than Jonah, you don't want to repent!
\v 42 And on the Judgment Day, the queen of the South\f + \fr 12:42 \fk queen of the South That is the Queen of Sheba, who traveled about 1,500 kilometers to learn wisdom from Solomon. That story is found in 1 Kings 10:1-13.\f* will stand up to testify against each of you who're now living in this age. For that queen came from faraway to learn wisdom from King Solomon. Pay attention, I'm greater than Solomon, and I'm here in front of you, but you don't want to hear Me!”
\s A warning for the people in this evil age
\r (Luke 11:24-26)
\p
\v 43 “Remember this example: When an evil spirit leaves a person, the spirit is forced to look here and there, and even in the desert to find another person. For the evil spirit wants to take control of a person so that the spirit can be calm. When it doesn't succeed in finding a new person,
\v 44 it thinks, ‘I'll return to the person whom I left.’ When it returns, it sees that the person has become like an empty house which has been swept clean and neatly arranged.
\v 45 Then it goes out and invites seven other spirits that are more evil than it is, to join it. When they enter and overpower that person, the situation of that person becomes much worse than before. Something like that will also happen to you who're now living in this evil age.”
\s Traits of people whom Jesus considers to be His family
\r (Mark 3:31-35; Luke 8:19-21)
\p
\v 46 While Jesus was still talking with the crowd, His mother and brothers came and stood outside and wanted to talk to Him.
\v 47 Then someone told Him, “Teacher, your mother and brothers are waiting outside. They want to talk to you.”
\p
\v 48 Jesus answered, “Now I'll show you the people whom I consider to be My mother and brothers!”\f + \fr 12:48 \fk Verse 48 \fk Literally, “Who's My mother? Who're My brothers?” Jesus began teaching a point with a rhetorical question that was translated as a statement.\f*
\v 49 And while pointing in the direction of us, His disciples, He said, “People like these are the ones I consider to be My brothers and sisters, and My mother—
\v 50 that is people who follow the will of My Father in heaven. They're the ones whom I consider to be My mother, and My brothers and sisters.”
