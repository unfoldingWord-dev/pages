\c 10
\s Jesus sends out His disciples
\r (Mark 3:13-19, 6:7-13; Luke 6:12-16, 9:1-6)
\p
\v 1 On another day, Jesus got us— His twelve disciples together, and gave us authority to drive out evil spirits and heal all kinds of diseases.
\v 2 He sent us out as His apostles. Our names were:
\li first Simon— who was also called Peter,
\li with his younger brother, Andrew,
\li then James and John— the two sons of Zebedee,
\li
\v 3 Philip, Bartholomew,
\li Thomas, and me, Matthew— who used to work as a tax collector,
\li James— the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus,
\li
\v 4 Simon— who had once followed the movement of people that fought to free Israel from the colonization of Rome,
\li and Judas who was from the village of Cariot— the one who would betray Jesus.
\p
\v 5 Before Jesus sent out us twelve apostles, He ordered us, “Don't go to the region of non-Jewish people, and don't enter Samaritan cities.
\v 6 For I'm sending each of you to the people of Israel who've wandered like a flock of sheep that has no shepherd.
\v 7 Go and tell them that God will soon set up His kingdom in this world.
\v 8 Heal sick people, bring dead people back to life, heal people who have contagious skin diseases, and drive out demons. Just as each of you were freely blessed by God, help and bless other people freely in the same way.
\v 9 Don't bring money in any form.
\v 10 And don't bring a bag, a change of clothes, a change of sandals, or a walking stick on your trip, because everyone who works deserves to receive what he needs.
\p
\v 11 “Wherever you go— whether to a city or village, look for a person who's kind-hearted who'll open the door of his home to you. Stay there until you leave again.
\v 12-13 When you enter the home of a person, express greetings to everyone who's in the house, and ask God that His feeling of peace will bless them. If they're truly good people, they'll receive you, and receive that blessing from God. But if not, go, and they won't be blessed either.
\v 14 If anyone doesn't receive you, or doesn't want to hear what you teach, remove the dirt from your feet and sandals when you leave that house or city.\f + \fr 10:14 \fk remove the dirt \fk Literally “shake the dust off.” At that time, it had become the tradition of Jews that if they were forced to make a trip into a region of non-Jewish people, the moment they left that region, they cleaned off the soles of their feet and their clothes. They did that because they considered non-Jewish people and their land to be ritually unclean and dirty. Jesus ordered His disciples to do the same thing to Jewish people who rejected God's teaching. In that way, the disciples showed that God considered people who were hard-headed like that to be dirty. That also became a sign that they would be punished by God if they didn't repent. See another example of this in Acts 18:6.\f*
\v 15 I'm telling you the truth, on the final judgment day, the residents of that city will receive a punishment that's more severe than the punishment that'll be given to the residents of Sodom and Gomorrah.”\f + \fr 10:15 \fk Sodom and Gomorrah \fk were two cities destroyed by God because of the evil of their residents. (Gen.19)\f*
\s Beware of the trouble that will happen
\r (Mark 13:9-13; Luke 21:12-17)
\p
\v 16 “Pay attention! I'm sending you into a terrifying situation— like the situation of sheep are being attacked by a pack of wolves. For that reason, each of you should be as wise as a snake and as innocent as a dove.
\v 17 Beware! You'll be arrested and taken to face various religious courts. And the leaders of Jewish synagogues will sentence you to be punished by ordering people to whip you.
\v 18 There'll also be those of you who'll be dragged to face government officials and kings because you tell about Me. This is an opportunity for you to testify about Me to them and to other people who aren't Jews.
\v 19 If you are tried, don't be afraid of what to say, or how you should defend yourself, because at that very moment what you should say will be made known to you.
\v 20 For what you actually say in that moment won't come from yourself, but from the Father's Spirit who is in you.
\p
\v 21 “Later on, the persecution against you will be really horrible, so that there'll be brothers who hand over their own biological brother to be killed. And the same thing will happen between a father and his own biological child. Children will also oppose their parents, and hand them over to be sentenced to death.
\v 22 And many people will hate you because you believe in Me.\f + \fr 10:22 \fk in Me \fk Literally, “because of My name.”\f* But the souls of everyone who remain faithful to me until the end will be saved.
\v 23 If you're persecuted in one city, run to another city. I'm telling you the truth: Before you finish visiting every city in Israel, I— the Son of Man, will have returned.
\p
\v 24-25 “Don't think that you'll be treated better than Me, My children. A student isn't accepted better than his teacher, and a worker isn't treated better than his master. A student should be satisfied if he's treated like his teacher. And a servant should be satisfied if he's treated like his master. Those who oppose Me have called Me Lucifer,\f + \fr 10:25 \fk Lucifer Literally, “Beelzebul.” Beelzebul is another name for Lucifer or satan— who is the leader of the evil spirits. See Matt. 9:34.\f* so they will call you children of Mine the same thing too, of course.”
\s Fear and respect God— not humans
\r (Luke 12:2-9; Mark 8:38)
\p
\v 26 “For that reason, don't be afraid of those who oppose us, because everything that people try to hide now, will be revealed at some later day. And everything that people try to keep secret now, will be known at some later time.
\v 27 In the same way, what I'm telling you secretly, say it openly, and what I whisper to you, broadcast it to everyone.
\p
\v 28 “Don't be afraid of men, because they can only kill your body, but they can't kill your soul. Instead, just fear and respect God, because He's able to destroy both your body and soul in the fire of hell.
\v 29 Remember this example: a pair of sparrows are sold for the price of the least valuable coin, yet none of them dies without our Father's knowledge.
\v 30 In fact, He even knows the total number of hairs on your head.
\v 31 So don't be afraid of those who oppose us, because you're far more important to our Father than many sparrows!
\p
\v 32 “Whoever admits to other people that he's My follower, I'll also admit that he's My follower to My Father who's in heaven.
\v 33 But whoever denies that he's My follower to other people, I'll also deny that he's My follower to My Father who's in heaven.”
\s The trouble that Jesus' followers will experience
\r (Luke 12:51-53, 14:26-27; Mark 8:34-37)
\p
\v 34 “Don't think that I came to this earth to bring peace. I didn't come to bring peace, but to bring a sword— meaning strong opposition.
\v 35 For I came to be the reason for what was prophesied in the Holy Bible,
\q1 ‘A son will oppose his father,
\q2 a daughter will oppose her mother,
\q1 and a daughter-in-law will oppose her mother-in-law.
\q2
\v 36 In fact, even your closest family members will become like enemies in disguise.’\x + Mic.7:6\x*
\p
\v 37 “Everyone who loves his father or mother more than Me, doesn't deserve to be called My follower. Everyone who loves his son or daughter more than Me doesn't deserve to be called My follower.
\v 38 Everyone who follows Me has to think, ‘I'll keep following the Lord, even to the point of death by crucifixion.’\f + \fr 10:38 \fk even to the point of death by crucifixion \fk Literally, “he must carry his own cross.”\f* Anyone who doesn't think like that doesn't deserve to be called My follower.
\v 39 Everyone who tries to hold onto his life will lose his life, but whoever loses his life because of following Me, will gain true life.”
\s God blesses those who accept you
\r (Mark 9:41; John 13:20)
\p
\v 40 “In God's eyes, a person who accepts you as My messenger is considered to accept Me directly. And whoever accepts Me, accepts God who sent Me.
\v 41 Whoever welcomes a prophet because he's aware that the prophet is God's messenger, will then take part in receiving God's blessing, like that given to a prophet. And whoever welcomes a righteous person because he truly is a righteous person, will take part in receiving God's blessing like that given to a righteous person.
\v 42 I'm telling you the truth: whoever helps one of My followers— even if it's simply giving a cup of cold water to the lowliest follower, that person will definitely receive a reward from God because of his deed.”
