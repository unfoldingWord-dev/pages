\s Jesus heals a paralyzed man in Capernaum
\r (Mark 2:1-12; Luke 5:17-26)
\p
\v 1 After that, Jesus and His disciples got into a boat and crossed the lake to return to His own city.
\v 2 When they arrived, some people brought a paralyzed man to Him who was lying on a mattress. When Jesus saw that they completely believed He had power to heal the paralyzed man, He said to the man, “Young man, take courage in your heart. I've now forgiven your sins.”
\p
\v 3 Some of the Law experts who heard Jesus' words, thought in their hearts, “This man is insulting God.”\f + \fr 9:3 \fk insulting God \fk The way they thought Jesus insulted God is shown in Mark 2:7— where people thought, “This man is too bold to speak like that! He has insulted God! No one can forgive the sins of man other than God Himself.”\f*
\p
\v 4 But Jesus knew what they thought, so He said to them, “You were wrong to think evil things about Me in your hearts!
\v 5 Of course it was hard for you to accept it when I said to the paralyzed man, ‘I've forgiven your sins.’ Is it easier for you to accept it if I say to him, ‘Get up, pick up your mattress and go home’?
\v 6 But by these words I'm proving to you that I, as the Son of Man,\f + \fr 9:6 \fk Son of Man \fk See the note in Matt. 8:20\f* have the right to forgive the sins of man!” Then Jesus said to the paralyzed man, “Get up, pick up your mattress and go back to your house!”
\p
\v 7 The man just stood up and went home to his house.
\v 8 When the crowd witnessed that, they were very amazed and praised God, who had given power like that to men.\f + \fr 9:8 \fk to men \fk When the people witnessed that miracle, they praised God, of course, because He had given power to Jesus, the Son of Man, to forgive sins and to do miracles. But in this verse, Matthew wrote 'men', plural— not 'a Man/Son of Man', which could be understood to be Jesus. People aren't actually given the power to forgive the sins of a person like God and Jesus forgive. But Jesus has given power to His followers— especially to the elders of the church, to tell about God's forgiveness of sins, and to make decisions about things that are considered to be sin among members of the church. (Matt. 16:19, 18:18; 1 Cor. 5:9-13; James 5:15-16, 19; 1 John 5:16-18)\f*
\s Matthew follows Jesus
\r (Mark 2:13-17; Luke 5:27-32)
\p
\v 9 When Jesus left that place, He saw me— Matthew,\f + \fr 9:9 \fk me— Matthew \fk Literally, just “Matthew.” In agreement with Indonesian grammar, 'I / me' and 'we / us' are used in this translation so that the reader understands that the writer of this Gospel was also an eyewitness. Matthew had another name, Levi.\f* sitting in my office. At the time, I was still working as a tax collector.\f + \fr 9:9 \fk tax collector \fk See note in Matt. 5:46.\f* Jesus said to me, “Follow Me!” So I just stood up and followed Him.
\p
\v 10 Then when Jesus ate supper at my house, many tax collectors and other people who were also considered to be sinners\f + \fr 9:10 \fk also considered to be sinners \fk All tax collectors were considered to be sinful people. See the footnote in Matt. 5:46.\f* came and ate with Him, and with us disciples of His.
\v 11 When the Pharisees\f + \fr 9:11 \fk Pharisees \fk See the note in Matt. 3:7.\f* saw that, they asked us, “Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and other sinful people?”
\p
\v 12 When He heard the Pharisees' question, Jesus answered them with this analogy, “A healthy person doesn't need a doctor. The one who needs a doctor is the sick person.
\v 13 Go and learn what God meant when He said, ‘Instead of sacrificing animals to Me, it's better for you to show compassion to other people.’\x + Hos. 6:6\x* It's the same with Me. I came to call people who are sinners to repent— not to call people who feel they're righteous.
\s Jesus answers a question about fasting
\r (Mark 2:18-22; Luke 5:33-39)
\p
\v 14 Then John the Baptist's disciples came to Jesus and said, “We often fast, and it's the same with the members of the Pharisee group too. But why don't Your disciples fast?”
\p
\v 15 Jesus answered by giving an example that showed a similarity, “It would never happen that the guests at a wedding feast would be ordered to fast as long as the groom was still with them! In the same way, as long as I'm still with My disciples, they won't fast. But think about what will happen when the groom is arrested by the people who oppose Him. That's what will happen to Me, and at that time My disciples will fast.”
\p
\v 16 Then Jesus gave them two other examples: “If a person owns an old tunic that's already torn, he can't patch the tunic with new cloth. For when the tunic is washed, the new patch of cloth will shrink, and will tear that part even more.
\v 17 It's the same with new wine.\f + \fr 9:17 \fk new wine \fk New grapes are pressed, and the grape juice is called new wine, and tastes sweet. New wine that's kept for a certain time will experience the process of fermentation. The longer it's kept, the higher the content of alcohol will be. In Bible times, what was called 'new wine' might still contain alcohol, but not as high a content as old wine.\f* That wine can't be poured into an old skin bag, for when the wine expands, and the air can't get out, the bag will be ruined. In the end, the wine will spill out, and the skin bag will be thrown away. For that reason, new wine has to be poured into a new skin bag too, so that the two of them will be stored well.”\f + \fr 9:17 \fk Verses 16-17 \fk In these two examples, Jesus compares something that's old with something that's new. And this lesson was given when He was asked about the tradition of fasting of the Jewish forefathers. Obviously, like new cloth and new wine, Jesus' teaching can't be combined with the forefather's old teachings.\f*
\s Jesus heals a woman with a bleeding disorder and brings the daughter of a Jewish leader back to life
\r (Mark 5:21-43; Luke 8:40-56)
\p
\v 18 While Jesus was teaching them those things, a Jewish leader came. He bowed in front of Jesus and said, “My daughter has just died, but I'm asking you to come to my house and lay your hands on her, so she'll live again.”
\p
\v 19 Then Jesus stood up and followed the leader to his house, along with us disciples of His.
\p
\v 20 But as Jesus was walking, a woman approached Him from behind and touched the fringe of His robe.\f + \fr 9:20 \fk fringe of His robe \fk Jewish robes had fringes, as commanded by Moses, as a reminder to follow all of the commands of the Law. See Num. 15:37-41.\f* That women had been continuously sick with a bleeding disorder for as long as twelve years,
\v 21 so she did that because she thought, “If I can just touch His robe, I'll definitely get well.”
\p
\v 22 Jesus turned around, saw the woman, and said, “My child, take courage at heart. Because you believe in Me completely, you'll be healed.” And at that very moment she was healed.
\p
\v 23 When Jesus arrived at the home of the Jewish leader, He saw the flute players who had begun to play mourning music, and the noisy crowd crying for the child.
\v 24 Then He said, “Get out, because this child isn't dead, she's just sleeping!” But they laughed at Jesus.
\v 25 After the crowd was chased out, He entered the child's room and held her hand, and the child woke up!
\v 26 Then the news about this event spread throughout that whole region.
\s Jesus makes two blind men able to see, and expels a demon from a mute man
\p
\v 27 When Jesus left that house, two blind men followed Him. They cried out, “Hey, Descendant of David,\f + \fr 9:27 \fk Hey, Descendant of David \fk Literally, “David's Son.” When the two blind men called Jesus 'Descendant of David', it didn't just mean that Jesus was from the family of David, because since before Jesus came, the prophets had prophesied that the King of Salvation would come from the descendants of King David. So all the Jews called the King of Salvation 'Descendant of David'. Because of that prophecy, they also thought, “He'll heal sick and blind people too.” So these two men already knew that Jesus was no ordinary person. See Is. 29:18-19, 35:4-6, 42:6-7\f* have compassion on us!”
\p
\v 28 Then he entered a house, and the two blind men came and approached Him. Jesus asked them, “Do you believe that I'm able to make you see again?”
\p They answered, “Yes, Lord, we believe.”
\p
\v 29 While touching their eyes, He said, “It'll happen according to your faith.”
\v 30 And they could see again! Then He firmly forbid them, “Don't tell anyone about what happened to you.”
\v 31 But they went and told the news about Jesus in that whole region.
\p
\v 32 The moment those two men left the house, some people came to Him bringing a mute man who was possessed by a demon.
\v 33 As soon as Jesus drove the demon out of the mute man, that very moment he could speak! The crowd there was amazed and said, “No miracle like this has ever happened in Israel!”
\p
\v 34 But the Pharisees said, “Jesus drives out demons by the power of the devil— who's the leader of all the demons.”
\s Jesus feels compassion for the crowd
\p
\v 35 Then Jesus visited many cities and villages. He taught in their synagogues and told the Good News about God's kingdom. He also healed people from many different kinds of diseases.
\v 36 When He saw the crowd that had come to Him, He felt such compassion for them because they were in trouble, and really needed help, like sheep that don't have a shepherd.
\v 37 Then He used this analogy to speak to us disciples of His, “All of these fields of wheat are ready to be harvested, but there are only a few people to harvest them.
\v 38 For that reason, pray that the Lord who owns these fields will send workers to harvest this wheat.”\f + \fr 9:38 \fk Verses 37-38 \fk To understand the analogy in these two verses, read John 4:35-38.\f*
