\c 21
\s Jesus is welcomed like a King in Jerusalem
\r (Mark 11:1-11; Luke 19:28-38; John 12:12-19)
\p
\v 1 When Jesus and we disciples of His were near Jerusalem, we came to the village of Bethphage, which is below the Mount of Olives. Then Jesus ordered two of His disciples to walk ahead
\v 2 and said to them, “Go to the village up ahead. As soon as you enter, you'll see a female donkey tied up with her colt. Untie both of them and bring them to Me.
\v 3 And if anyone asks you what you're doing, just say, ‘The Lord needs both of these donkeys,’ and they'll quickly allow you to take them.”
\p
\v 4 This happened so that what was spoken by God through a prophet would be fulfilled, which is,
\q1
\v 5 “Tell all of the residents of Jerusalem,
\q2 ‘Pay attention, your King is coming to you!
\q1 He's humble and carried by a pack donkey—
\q2 even a young donkey.’”\x + Zach. 9:9\x*
\p
\v 6 Then the two disciples went and did exactly what Jesus told them to do.
\v 7 They brought the donkey, along with her colt, and placed their robes on the backs of both donkeys as a covering to sit on. Then Jesus climbed onto the young donkey.\f + \fr 21:7 \fk the young donkey \ft What Matthew wrote can be interpreted, “climbed on top of the cloaks,” or “climbed on top of the two donkeys.” The second interpretation can mean that Jesus rode one of the donkeys, then rode the other, because it's impossible to ride both donkeys at the same time. According to the way Matthew writes in this Gospel, he liked using the two donkeys, because the quote in verse 5 mentions two kinds of donkeys— namely “onon” (donkey) and “polon” (young donkey). This translation chooses the colt as the one ridden by Jesus, because Mark and Luke's Gospels say that Jesus rode a young donkey that had never been ridden by anyone else. See Mark 11:2 and Luke 19:30\f*
\v 8 In order to honor Jesus, most of the crowd who had gathered there took off their robes and spread them on the road, and there were also some who covered the road with leafy branches.\f + \fr 21:8 \fk In order to honor Jesus … \ft The crowd did these traditional things to welcome the coming of a king. The main road was covered so that the feet of the king didn't touch the ground, and by putting their cloaks under the feet of the coming king, it meant they were submitting to the rule of that king. But according to the Word of the Lord quoted in verse 5, Jesus' coming wasn't like a king's coming. A king would usually come riding a tall, strong horse, like a war horse. But Jesus just rode on a pack donkey to show that He came with a humble heart.\f*
\v 9 The people who went ahead of Jesus, and also behind Him all shouted,
\q1 “Hosanna!\f + \fr 21:9 \ft \fk Hosanna \ft In the ancient Hebrew language, hosanna meant, 'Lord, save us!' or 'Praise the Lord!' But at the time of Jesus, the meaning had changed into being praise for the king, similar to the word 'dirgahayu' in the Indonesian language, or 'long live the king', in English. In using the word hosanna, it's clear that the crowd was praising God because they accepted Jesus as the Messiah— the King of Salvation who had been promised.\f* Praise God for the coming of this Descendant of David!
\q2 May God bless this king who comes to represent the Lord.\x + Ps. 118:25-26\x*
\q1 Praise to God in the highest level of heaven.”
\p
\v 10 When Jesus entered Jerusalem, all the inhabitants of the city were stirred up, so the people were asking, “Who's this man?”
\p
\v 11 The crowd following Jesus answered, “This man is Jesus! He's the prophet that comes from Nazareth in the province of Galilee!”
\s Jesus drives out people who made God's Temple into a market
\r (Mark 11:15-19; Luke 19:45-48; John 2:13-22)
\p
\v 12 Then Jesus entered the courtyard of God's Temple and drove out all the people who were buying and selling there. He turned over the tables that were used by the money changers.\f + \fr 21:12 \fk money changers \ft At that time, the king of Rome governed the whole Jewish region, and many other provinces. For that reason, the money used daily was the currency of Rome. But all the chief priests had declared that, “The money of the country of Rome can't be offered to the Lord.” So people who came to God's Temple had to change their money first, so that they could use the money that was allowed, and valid for use in God's Temple. At that time, the money that was allowed to be used was the currency from Tyre. The chief priests also had authority over everything that was sold in God's Temple, so they became rich from the profits of the sellers and the money changers.\f* And He also overturned the benches that were used by the dove sellers.
\p
\v 13 He said to them, “In the Holy Bible God says,
\q ‘My House will be called the house of prayer.’\x + Is. 56:7\x*
\m But you have changed it into ‘a hiding place for thieves!’”\x + Jer. 7:11\x*
\p
\v 14 Then many blind and lame people came to Him in God's Temple courtyard, and He made all of the blind people see and all of the lame people walk.
\v 15 And when the chief priests and Law experts saw the miracles Jesus did, and heard the little children shouting in the courtyard of God's Temple, “Hosanna, praise God for this Descendant of David,” they became very angry.
\v 16 They said to Him, “You hear those children, don't you?! Why don't you forbid them to say that?!”
\p He answered them, “Yes, I hear. But how long will it be before you understand God's Word?! For the writer of the Psalms said to God,
\q1 ‘You've taught children and babies to give perfect praise to Me.’”\x + Ps. 8:3\x*
\v 17 Then Jesus and we disciples left them, and went out of the city to the village of Bethany, to spend the night there.
\s Jesus curses a fig tree that doesn't bear fruit
\r (Mark 11:12-14, 20-24)
\p
\v 18 Very early the next morning, as Jesus was returning with us to the city of Jerusalem, He felt hungry.
\v 19 He saw a fig tree on the side of the road and approached the tree to see if it had any fruit. But there was obviously no fruit, just leaves. So He said to the tree, “From now on you'll never bear fruit again.” And at that very moment the tree dried up.
\p
\v 20 When we disciples of His saw that, we were extremely amazed and asked, “How could the fig tree dry up right away?!”
\p
\v 21 Jesus answered, “If each of you believes in your heart without doubting, you'll also be able to do miracles like I did to this tree— and even greater miracles than this. For example, you can ask God to move this mountain into the sea, and it'll happen.
\v 22 Everything that you ask for in prayer, believe that God is giving it, and then you'll receive it.”
\s Jesus is asked about His right to teach
\r (Mark 11:27-33; Luke 20:1-8)
\p
\v 23 When Jesus had returned to the courtyard of God's Temple and was teaching there, the chief priests and Jewish leaders came to Him and said, “Who gave you the right to teach and change our traditions— like you did yesterday?! In whose name did you do that?”
\p
\v 24 He answered, “I want to ask you something too. If you answer Me, then I'll also tell you Who gave Me that right.
\v 25 Who gave John the Baptist the right to baptize people? Was it God who gave it, or did he work of his own will?”
\p Then they said to each other, “If we answer ‘God gave it,’ then he'll ask us, ‘If so, why didn't you believe in John?’
\v 26 But we can't answer, ‘He worked of his own will,’ because we're afraid that this crowd will get mad at us!” They were afraid of the crowd, because everyone who gathered there believed that John was a prophet.
\v 27 So they answered Jesus, “We don't know.”
\p Then He said to them, “If that's so, I won't tell you Who gave Me the right to do things like that either.”
\s The parable of the vineyard owner's two sons
\p
\v 28 “Now tell me your opinion about this story: There was a father who had two sons. One day he told the first one, ‘Son, go work today in the vineyard.’
\p
\v 29 “His son said, ‘I don't want to,!’ But later he regretted that, and went to work in the vineyard.
\p
\v 30 “Then the father told the second son to work in the vineyard. The son answered, ‘Yes, Dad, I'll go.’ But he didn't go.
\p
\v 31 “In your opinion, which of the two sons did his father's will?”
\p They answered, “The first one.”
\p Then Jesus said to them, “What I'm saying is true: Sinners— like tax collectors and prostitutes, will more likely be allowed to enter God's kingdom than you will be!
\v 32 For John came and showed you what it means to live according to God's will, and you didn't want to believe his teaching. But the tax collectors and prostitutes believed in him. Even though you witnessed that amazing thing, you had no regret and you didn't start believing in John's teachings.”
\s The Jews always reject God's messengers
\r (Mark 12:1-12; Luke 20:9-19)
\p
\v 33 “Listen to this other story: There was a land owner who ordered his servants to make a large vineyard— complete with a fence around it. Then they dug a hole as a place for pressing grapes, and built a tall guard building— so that the watchman could see if there were thieves or animals trying to get into the vineyard. After that, he rented out the vineyard to several tenant farmers, and then went to another land with his servants.
\v 34 When the harvest season came, he ordered his servants to go back to the tenant farmers to collect his share of the vineyard's produce.
\p
\v 35 “But the tenant farmers captured the servants. They beat one, killed another, and threw stones at another one until he died.
\v 36 The vineyard owner sent other servants— more than the first time. But the tenant farmers treated them the same way.
\v 37 Finally he sent his own son to the tenant farmers thinking, ‘They'll certainly respect my own son.’
\p
\v 38 “But when they saw the son coming, they said to each other, ‘Look! The guy who's coming is the owner's own son! He'll be the owner of this vineyard when his father dies later on. Let's kill him, so that the vineyard becomes ours.’
\v 39 So they caught him and dragged him out of the vineyard, and then killed him.”
\p
\v 40 Then Jesus asked them, “So, when the owner of the vineyard returns, what will he do to those tenant farmers?”
\p
\v 41 One of the people who heard Him answered, “He'll torture those tenant farmers and destroy them, of course! Then he'll rent out the vineyard to other tenant farmers who'll faithfully give him his share of the produce when the harvest season comes.”
\p
\v 42 Then Jesus said to them, “How long will it be before you understand God's Word?! For it's written,
\q1 ‘The stone that the builders considered useless
\q2 God made into the most important foundation stone.
\q1 What God did is truly amazing to us!’\x + Ps. 118:22-23\x*
\p
\v 43 “For that reason, I'm telling you that the rights of citizenship in God's kingdom will be taken from you Jewish people and will be given to other people groups— that is to those who faithfully do God's will.
\v 44 Everyone who trips on that foundation stone will be destroyed. And everyone on whom that stone falls will be totally demolished into tiny pieces.”
\p
\v 45 When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard those parables, they understood that Jesus spoke about them.
\v 46 So they looked for a way to arrest Him. But they couldn't, because they were afraid of the crowd who believed that Jesus was a prophet.
