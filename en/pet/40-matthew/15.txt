\s What makes us spiritually unclean in God's eyes
\r (Mark 7:1-23)
\p
\v 1 After that, some of the Pharisees and Law experts came from Jerusalem to meet with Jesus. They said to Him,
\v 2 “We don't approve of your students who don't follow the rules that were given by our forefathers, because they don't pour water\f + \fr 15:2 \fk pour water over their hands \fk What is meant by pouring water over their hands here isn't like what we usually do now— which is washing our hands with soap before we eat. This custom of hand washing wasn't commanded in the Old Testament, and apparently was only done by the Pharisees. They dipped their hands in water, or a servant poured water over their hands. This was done as a religious regulation, and not like washing hands with soap. See Mark 7:3-4.\f* over their hands before eating!”
\p
\v 3 Jesus answered, “And I don't approve of you who break various laws of God just to obey the cultural customs of our forefathers!
\v 4 For God commanded, ‘Honor your mother and father,’\x + Ex. 20:12; Deut. 5:16\x* and ‘A person who insults his mother and father must be given the death penalty .’
\v 5-6 But you teach that a person may say to his mother or father, ‘I can't help you any more because I've promised to give all my possessions to God later on.’ You teach that a person who has done that, doesn't need to honor his mother and father, or listen to their requests. In doing that, you cancel God's Law in order to follow the cultural customs of our forefathers.
\v 7 You only pretend to be good! The prophecy of Isaiah about you was very precise when he said,
\q1
\v 8 ‘These people respect Me with their mouths,
\q2 but their hearts are actually far from Me.
\q1
\v 9 They worship Me for no reason,
\q2 because they only teach men's rules.’”\x + Is. 29:13\x*
\p
\v 10 Then Jesus called the crowd and said, “Listen to Me, all of you, and try to understand.
\v 11 Whatever a person puts into his mouth doesn't make him unclean in God's eyes, but what comes out of the person's mouth is what makes him unclean in God's eyes.”
\p
\v 12 Then we disciples of His came and said to Him, “Do You know that the Pharisees were offended because of what You said?”
\p
\v 13 So Jesus used an illustration to answer us, saying, “Every plant that isn't planted by My Father who's in heaven will be pulled up by its roots.
\v 14 You don't need to pay attention to the Pharisees, because they're like blind people leading blind people. Both of them will fall into a hole, for sure.”
\p
\v 15 Peter said, “Explain the meaning of that new analogy to us.”
\p
\v 16 Jesus said, “Don't you understand yet either?!
\v 17 For sure you understand that all the food that enters through the mouth goes down into the stomach, and then it's passed out into the toilet,
\v 18 but what comes out of a person's mouth comes from his heart. That's what makes him unclean in God's eyes,
\v 19 because all evil thoughts come from within the heart, including thoughts of murder, adultery, sex before marriage, stealing, lying and insulting people.
\v 20 Things like that are what make a person unclean, not because he doesn't pour water over his hands before eating!”
\s Jesus tests the heart of a woman who isn't Jewish
\r (Mark 7:24-30)
\p
\v 21 Then Jesus left that place with us disciples of His, and went to the region around Tyre and Sidon.
\v 22 Then a woman who came from that region— that is the region of Canaan, came to Him. She cried out, “Lord, Descendant of David,\f + \fr 15:22 \fk Descendant of David \fk See the note in Matt. 9:2.\f* help me, because my young daughter is possessed by a demon and is really suffering.”
\p
\v 23 Jesus didn't answer the woman at all, so we came to Him and said, “Order that woman to go away, because she keeps on following us and crying out.”
\p
\v 24 Jesus answered, “God sent Me just to shepherd the sheep of Israel who've strayed.”
\p
\v 25 But the woman came, and then bowed down before Him and said, “Lord, help me!”
\p
\v 26 Then Jesus said to her, “You aren't a Jew, so if I help you, that would be like a person taking his children's food and giving it to the dog.”
\p
\v 27 Then the woman answered, “That's true, Sir. Let the Jewish children eat first. But usually the dogs eat the leftover food that falls from their master's table.”
\p
\v 28 Then Jesus answered, “Woman, you really do have faith in Me! Because of that it'll happen just like you've requested”, and at that very moment her daughter was well.
\s Jesus heals many sick people
\p
\v 29 Jesus left that region and returned to walk along the shore of Lake Galilee. Then He climbed a hill and sat there.
\v 30 Many people came to Him, bringing various kinds of sick people, including those who were paralyzed, lame, blind, mute, and sick with other diseases. They placed all the sick people in front of Jesus, and He healed them!
\v 31 The crowd was really amazed when they saw that the people who used to be paralyzed or lame were able to walk well, the mute could talk, and the blind could see. hey all praised the God of Isra becase of that.
\s Jesus feeds more than four thousand people
\r (Mark 8:1-10)
\p
\v 32 Then Jesus called us disciples of His and said, “I have so much compassion on this crowd because they've been with Me for three days already, and now they don't have anymore food. I don't have the heart to order them to go home hungry. I don't want them to faint on the way.”
\v 33 We said to Him, “Where can we buy enough bread for the needs of this many people in a lonely place like this?!”
\p
\v 34 Jesus answered, “How many pieces of bread do you have?”
\p We answered, “Just seven pieces, and there are some small fish.”
\v 35 Then He ordered the crowd to sit down on the ground.
\v 36 Jesus just took the seven pieces of bread and the fish. After giving thanks, He broke the bread and the fish, and then He gave it to us, so we distributed it to the crowd.
\v 37 The whole crowd ate until they were satisfied. After that, as many as seven large baskets of leftover food were gathered.
\v 38 The people who ate it were about four thousand men, not even counting women and children.
\v 39 After that, Jesus ordered them to go home. Then He climbed into a boat with us and went to the region of Magadan.
