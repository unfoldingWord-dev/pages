\s The parable of ten young unmarried women
\p
\v 1 “When I— the Son of Man, return and am welcomed as King of this world, that event can be illustrated in this story: On a certain night, there was a wedding feast. There were ten young unmarried women who were getting ready to attend the wedding feast, and each of them brought a lamp and went to welcome the groom.
\v 2 As it turned out, five of the young women were wise and the other five were foolish.
\v 3-4 Each of the wise young women brought an extra bottle of oil for their lamps, but the five foolish ones just brought their lamps without bringing extra oil.
\v 5 But the groom took a long time coming, so all of the young women got sleepy and fell asleep.
\p
\v 6 “At midnight someone cried out, ‘The groom's coming! Let's welcome him!’
\p
\v 7 “The young women quickly wike up and fixed their lamp wicks so that they shone brighter.
\v 8 Then each of the foolish ones asked the wise ones, ‘Give me a little of your oil, because my lamp is going out.’
\p
\v 9 “But each of the wise ones answered, ‘Oh, I can't! If I give you some, there won't be enough for me anymore. It's better that you go and buy some from the oil merchant.’
\p
\v 10 “While they went to buy oil, the groom arrived. The five wise young women who were ready went into the place of the wedding feast. Then the door was locked.
\p
\v 11 “Not long after that, the foolish young women came too and said, ‘Sir, sir, please, open the door for us!’
\p
\v 12 “The groom answered, ‘I'm telling you the truth: I don't know you.’
\p
\v 13 “For that reason, always be prepared, because you don't know the day or the hour of My return!”
\s The parable of faithful and unfaithful servants
\r (Luke 19:11-27)
\p
\v 14 “The situation of those of you waiting for the beginning of God's kingdom can be illustrated by this parable: There was a rich man who was preparing to visit another land far away. Before he left, he said to his servants, ‘Keep working and trading with my wealth that I'm going to entrust to you.’
\v 15 Then he distributed his wealth to those servants according to each one's ability. For example, the first servant received five bags of gold coins.\f + \fr 25:15 \fk bags of gold coins \ft Literally, “talents.” One talent was approximately the price of 26-36 kilograms of gold or silver.\f* The second servant received two bags of gold coins, and the third servant received just one bag of gold coins. Then the rich man left.
\v 16 The first servant, who received five bags of gold coins, quickly went to use the money as capital for buying and selling, and he made a profit of five bags of gold coins.
\v 17 It was the same for the second servant, who had received two bags of gold coins. He made a profit of two bags of gold coins.
\v 18 But the third servant, who received one bag of gold coins, went and dug a hole in the ground, and hid the money in the hole so that it would be safe.
\p
\v 19 “After a long time, the rich man came home. Then he called his servants to give a report about the results of their efforts.
\v 20 So the first servant came and turned over ten bags of gold coins saying, ‘At that time, you entrusted five bags of gold coins to me, Sir, and now look! Because of my efforts that money has become two times more.’
\p
\v 21 “Then his master said to him, ‘Great! You're a good and faithful servant! Because you can be trusted with a small responsibility, I'll give you greater responsibilities. Come and take part in my homecoming party, and share my joy with me.’
\p
\v 22 “Then the second servant came and turned over four bags of gold coins, saying, ‘At that time, you entrusted me with two bags of gold coins, Sir, and now look! Because of my efforts, that money has become two times more.’
\p
\v 23 “And his master said to him, ‘Great! You're a good and faithful servant! Because you can be trusted with a small responsibility, I'll give you greater responsibilities. Come and take part in my homecoming party, and share my joy with me.’
\p
\v 24 “Then the third servant came too, and said to his master, ‘Sir, I know that you're a harsh man, who makes a lot of profit from other people's efforts. For example, you harvest in places where you didn't plant, and you take produce from places where you didn't scatter seeds.
\v 25 Because of that I was afraid, and thought, “I don't want to cause loss to my master!” So I went and kept the money safe in the ground, and now look! Here's your money.’
\p
\v 26 “So his master answered him, ‘You're a lazy, evil servant! You know that I make a lot of profit from the efforts of other people, including taking produce where I've never planted or scattered seeds.
\v 27 So you should've saved my money in the bank, so that they could use it, and I could've gotten my money back with interest.’
\p
\v 28 “Then the rich man said to his other servants, ‘Because of that, take that money from him and give it to the first servant who already has ten bags of gold coins.’”
\v 29 Then Jesus summarized it like this, “God will give even more to every person who works faithfully with what God gave him, until he has an abundance. But for everyone who doesn't work faithfully with what was given to him, whatever he still has will be taken from him.
\v 30 And after that, the rich man said to his other servants, ‘Throw this useless servant out into the darkest prison. The people will always weep there because of suffering severely.’”
\s The Son of Man will judge the righteous and wicked people
\p
\v 31 “When I come with My angels, and in My glory as the Son of Man and High King, I'll sit on the throne that displays My glory.
\v 32 Then the angels will gather people from every ethnic group in front of Me. And I'll separate them into two groups, like a shepherd separates sheep from goats.
\v 33 I'll place those whom I determine to be sheep on My right side, and the goats on My left side.
\p
\v 34 “As the King who judges, I'll say to those on My right side, ‘Come, you who've been blessed by My Father! Take part in My kingdom which has been prepared for you since the world was created.
\v 35 For when I was hungry, you were the ones who fed Me. And when I was thirsty, you were the ones who gave Me a drink. When I came as a foreigner to your land, you were the ones who gave me a place to stay.
\v 36 And when I needed clothing, you were the ones who gave Me clothes. When I was sick, you were the ones who took care of Me, and when I was in prison, you were the ones who visited Me.’
\p
\v 37 “Then the people who're righteous will ask Me, ‘Lord, when did we see You hungry and feed You, or thirsty and give You a drink?
\v 38 When did we see You as a foreigner, and give You a place to stay, or when did You need clothing and we gave clothes to You?
\v 39 And when did we see You sick and we took care of You, or when were You in prison and we visited You?’
\p
\v 40 “And I'll answer them, ‘I'm telling you the truth: Every time you took the opportunity to do things like that for one of these brothers and sisters of Mine— even for the lowliest person, you've done it for Me.’
\p
\v 41 “Then I'll say to the people who're on My left side, ‘Hey, you who're cursed! Get away from Me and go into the fire that won't be extinguished forever— which is the place that was prepared for the devil and all the angels who are on his side.
\v 42 For when I was hungry, you didn't feed Me, and when I was thirsty, you didn't give me a drink.
\v 43 When I was a foreigner, you didn't give Me a place to stay, and when I needed clothing, you didn't give Me clothes. When I was sick, or in prison, you didn't visit Me either.’
\p
\v 44 “Then they'll ask, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty, or as a foreigner, or needing clothing, or sick, or in prison, and we didn't pay attention to Your needs?’
\p
\v 45 “And I'll answer them, ‘I'm telling you the truth: Every time you didn't take the opportunity to do those things for one of My lowliest brothers or sisters, you didn't do it for Me either.’
\p
\v 46 “So those people will enter the place of eternal punishment, but the righteous people will enter the place of eternal life.”
