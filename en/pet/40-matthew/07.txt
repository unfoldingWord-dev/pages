\c 7
\s Jesus teaches about judging
\r (Luke 6:37-38, 41-42)
\p
\v 1 “Don't make yourself a judge of other people's wrongs, so that God won't judge you either, if you do wrong to other people in the same way.\f + \fr 7:1 \fk Verse 1 \ft Literally, “Don't judge, so that you yourself aren't judged.” This verse is well known as a verse that is commonly misused. This prohibition doesn't go against other verses in the Bible, which show many ways God's people need to determine if other people's deeds are right or wrong. This verse needs to be understood according to Jesus' teaching that follows in verses 2-5.\f*
\v 2 For you'll be judged by God the same way you judge other people. And you'll be given as heavy a punishment by God as you give other people, .
\p
\v 3-4 Don't blame another person for a small wrong. Whoever does that is like a person who notices the sawdust in his brother's eye, while he doesn't even notice the beam of wood in his own eye. Then he arrogantly says to his brother, ‘Let me take the sawdust out of your eye!’
\v 5 Hey, you who're just pretending to be a good person! Take the beam of wood out of your own eye first, and only after that will you see clearly enough to take the sawdust out of your brother's eye.
\s People who don't deserve to study the teaching about spiritual matters in depth
\p
\v 6 “Don't give lessons that are holy to people who're like dogs, for they'll turn and attack you later on. And don't throw spiritual wisdom at people who're like pigs, because they'll just trample on it.”
\s Jesus' advice to persist in prayer
\r (Luke 11:9-13)
\p
\v 7 “Keep on asking from God, then you'll receive it. Keep on seeking, then you'll find it. Keep on knocking, then the door will be opened for you.
\v 8 For everyone who diligently asks, will receive what he's asking for. Everyone who diligently looks, will find what he's seeking. And the door will be opened for anyone who knocks on it continuously.
\p
\v 9 “If your child asks for food,\f + \fr 7:9 \fk food \ft Literally, “bread.” The main food in Israel, at the time Jesus taught, was bread. The translation team translated it as 'food', because for most of the people in Indonesia, bread isn't the main food, but is special.\f* you wouldn't give him a stone, of course— would you?!
\v 10 Or if your child asks for fish, you wouldn't give him a poisonous snake, of course— would you?!
\v 11 If you who're evil know how to give good things to your children, your Father in heaven will do even more! He'll give what's good to each of us who asks Him, of course.”
\s The most important law
\p
\v 12 “Treat everyone like you want them to treat you, because this is the core principle that's taught by the Law, and the teaching of the prophets.”
\s The way to heaven and the way to hell
\r (Luke 13:24)
\p
\v 13 “Go through the door that's narrow to go toward eternal life, because the door of the gate to hell is wide and easy to go through, and many people enter through that gate.
\v 14 Whereas the door that goes toward eternal life is narrow and hard to go through, and only a few people will seek until they find it.”
\s The way to know a false prophet
\r (Luke 6:43-44, 13:25-27)
\p
\v 15 “Be careful about false prophets. When one of them comes into your fellowship, he'll say, 'I'm a lamb of God just like you are.' However, he's a dangerous wolf.
\v 16 You can know false prophets from their teaching and their deeds. Just as wild plants with thorns can't produce grapes or figs, so an evil person can't produce good things either.
\v 17 In the same way, every tree that's good produces good fruit. And every tree that isn't good produces bad fruit.
\v 18 A tree that's good can't produce fruit that can't be eaten, and a tree that's bad can't produce fruit that's good.
\v 19 Every tree that doesn't produce good fruit will be cut down and burned.
\v 20 You'll know the false prophets the same way, by their teaching and their deeds.
\p
\v 21 “Not everyone who calls Me, ‘Lord, Lord’, will become a citizen of God's kingdom.\f + \fr 7:21 \fk God's kingdom \ft Literally, “kingdom of heaven.” See the note in Matt. 6:33.\f* But those who'll become citizens of God's kingdom are each of those who do the will of My Father who's in heaven.
\v 22 On the Judgment Day, many people will say to Me, ‘Lord, Lord, we've prophesied in Your name. And by calling on Your name we've cast out demons and done many miracles.’
\v 23 But at that time I'll answer them frankly, ‘Hey, all of you who do evil: Get away from My presence! I never said that you were friends of Mine.’”\f + \fr 7:23 \fk said that you were friends of Mine \ft Literally, “knew you.”\f*
\s A wise person and a foolish person
\r (Luke 6:47-49)
\p
\v 24 “For that reason, everyone who hears My teachings and does them, is like a wise person who builds his house on a very large, solid rock which is used as the foundation of that house.
\v 25 Then heavy rains fall and a flood rises and strikes the house. A strong wind blows against the house too. But the house keeps standing firm, because it was built on a foundation of solid rock.
\p
\v 26 “But everyone who hears My teachings and doesn't do them, is like a foolish person who builds his house right on the bare sand.
\v 27 Then heavy rains fall and a flood strikes the house. A strong wind blows against the house too. Then the house collapses and is seriously damaged.”
\p
\v 28 When Jesus finished teaching all that, the crowd who heard Him was really amazed at His teachings,
\v 29 because He didn't teach like the Law experts. He taught with authority, like an important person who has the right to give commands that must be followed.
