\c 23
\s Don't imitate the way of life of the Law experts
\r (Mark 12:38-40; Luke 11:37-52; 20:45-47)
\p
\v 1 Then Jesus said to the crowd and to us disciples of His,
\v 2 “The Law experts and the Pharisees sit in the position of Moses as legitimate judges, to explain and teach Moses' Law.
\v 3 For that reason, obey and do everything they teach you. But don't imitate the deeds of the Law experts and the Pharisees, because they don't do what they teach.
\v 4 They burden us with many religious rules which are very difficult to follow, yet they themselves only pretend to to be people that carry out all those rules And when we feel it's difficult to carry out all those rules, they who teach the rules don't care about us. In fact, they're too lazy to lift a finger to help us overcome our difficulties.
\v 5 And all the good deeds that they do are just for show. For example, they enlarge their reminder boxes\f + \fr 23:5 \fk reminder boxes (phylacteries) \ft At that time, the Jews tied small boxes to their foreheads or arms that were filled with four important parts from the Holy Bible. (Ex. 13:1-10; 11-16; Deut. 6:4-9; 11:18-21). The small boxes were made from leather, and were used to help remind them that they had inherited the Law. (Deut. 6:6-9) But people in the Pharisee group made those boxes bigger than normal, in order to brag about themselves that they were more devout than others.\f* and lengthen the tassels on the four corners of their robes.\f + \fr 23:5 \fk tassels on the four corners of their robes \ft According to the Law's rules, all Jewish men had to attach tassels to the four corners of their robes. (Numb. 15:38-40; Deut. 22:12) Those tassels were to remind all the Jewish people to faithfully follow all the Law's commands too.\f*
\v 6 In the synagogues, or at dinner parties, they like to sit in the front row seats.
\v 7 And when they walk in the market, they're really happy when people greet them respectfully, like this, ‘Good day, Teacher.’
\p
\v 8 “But don't any of you let other people call you ‘Teacher.’ For you have just one Teacher, and you're all brothers.
\v 9 And don't call anyone in this world, ‘Father.’ For we only have one Father— our Father who is in heaven.
\v 10 And don't desire to be called, ‘Leader’, either. For you only have one Leader— and that's Me, the Christ.
\v 11 Instead, the person whom God considers to be the greatest among you, is the person who is humble and serves all of you.
\v 12 Whoever makes himself seem great, will be humbled by God. And whoever humbles himself will be made great by Him.”
\p
\v 13-14 Then, while the crowd was still there, Jesus rebuked the Jewish leaders directly, “You Law experts and you Pharisees are so unfortunate! You just pretend to be good people! You hinder the way for other people, so that it's difficult for them to become citizens of God's kingdom, while you yourselves don't follow the way to enter God's kingdom. Instead, you become a huge obstacle for other people who want to enter there.\f + \fr 23:13-14 \fk Verse 14 \ft Several ancient Greek copies add these words from Mark 12:40— which after several hundred years have been considered to be verse 14: “All of you Law experts and you Pharisees are so unfortunate! You usually deceive widows using this excuse, ‘I'll help you manage the possessions of your husband who died.’ But you actually only pretend to help, because you want to steal those possessions until they're all gone. And to cover up that evil, you pray long prayers in the synagogues, so that people think you're a good person. As the result of deeds like that, God will certainly give you a very harsh punishment.”\f*
\p
\v 15 “You Law experts and you Pharisees are so unfortunate! You only pretend to be good people! Not many people want to become members of your group, so you look far and wide, even crossing land and sea, to find one person who wants to become a member of your group. And when that person becomes a member of your group, you make him a candidate for hell who is twice as evil as you are yourselves.
\p
\v 16 “You're so unfortunate because you want to be guides for other people, but you yourselves are blind! You teach, ‘If a person strengthens his promise by calling on God's Temple alone,\f + \fr 23:16 \fk strengthens his promise … \ft In the Ten Commandments, it was forbidden to say the name of God casually. For that reason, Jewish people used other words to keep from directly expressing 'God'. So when a Jewish person swore, or promised something, they rarely said, “May God see me if I lie!” If a person strengthened a promise by saying God, it meant he was held to that promise. For that reason, they usually strengthened their promises by using other words. For example, a person could say, “May Heaven see me if I lie,” or “May God's Temple see me …,” So because of their custom, the Law experts needed to determine which words that were used truly bound a person to his promise or oath in God's eyes, and which words were considered insignificant.\f* he doesn't have to keep his promise. But if he strengthens his promise by calling on the gold that's in God's Temple, then he has to keep his promise.’
\v 17 You're blind and stupid people! How can you not realize that in God's eyes, His Temple is more important than the gold mentioned, because God's Temple is what makes that gold holy?!
\v 18 You also teach, ‘If a person strengthens his promise by calling on the altar in God's Temple, he isn't bound to keep his promise. But if he strengthens his promise by calling on the offering on the altar, he has to keep that promise.’
\v 19 You're blind people! How can you not realize that in God's eyes, the altar is more important than the offering, because it's the altar that makes the offering on it holy?!
\v 20 For whoever strengthens his promise by calling on the altar, has involved both God's altar, and all the offerings on that altar.
\v 21 And whoever strengthens his promise by calling on God's Temple, has involved both God's Temple, and He who lives there.
\v 22 And whoever strengthens his promise by calling on heaven, has involved the throne of God Himself, and He who sits on the throne.
\p
\v 23 “You Law experts and you Pharisees are so unfortunate! You just pretend to be good people! You only follow the rules of the Law that are easy, but forget to do God's most important commands. For example, each of you gives a tithe to God's Temple of the spices produced in your gardens— such as basil, dill, and cumin.\f + \fr 23:23 \fk tithe \ft Moses' Law said that the Jews were to give a tithe of all food produced in their fields (Lev. 27:30-32; Deut. 26:12). That didn't include the small plants that were mentioned in that verse. This meant that the Law experts and the Pharisees had given more than the Law demanded, in order to show how great they were at keeping the Law.\f* But you forget to follow God's most important commands, which are— showing compassion, doing what's just, and keeping your promises to other people. You should do those things that are most important, and not forget to do the things that are easy, too.
\v 24 Hey, you who want to become guides for other people, even though you yourselves are blind! The way you follow God's commands can be illustrated by someone who takes a gnat out of his drinking water, but just swallows the camel that's in the water!
\p
\v 25 “You Law experts and you Pharisees are so unfortunate! You just pretend to be good people! The way you follow God's commands can be illustrated by a person who only washes a plate or cup on the outside, but forgets to wash the inside, which is very dirty. Your hearts are full of filth like that too— that is you don't control yourselves, and you deceive people to get money.
\v 26 Hey, you Pharisees who're blind, how long will it be before you become aware that you have to clean the inner part first, and then the outer part will be clean too!
\p
\v 27 “You Law experts and you Pharisees are so unfortunate! You just pretend to be good people! You're like graves that have been painted white. The outsides look good of course, but inside they're full of rotting flesh and bones, and many kinds of filth.
\v 28 It's the same with you, because when other people see you from the outside, you look like righteous people, yet your hearts are actually full of desires to break God's commands, and you only pretend to be righteous.
\p
\v 29-31 “You Law experts and you Pharisees are so unfortunate! You just pretend to be good people! You're descendants of the people who murdered the prophets! Your forefathers are the ones who killed the prophets, and now you're rebuilding and decorating the prophets' graves. And with your own mouths you say, ‘If we had lived in the time of our forefathers, we certainly wouldn't have taken part in killing those righteous people’. But by saying that, it's clear that you admit that you're descendants of those murderers!
\v 32 So if that's true, go on and finish the work begun by your forefathers!
\p
\v 33 “You're just like poisonous snakes, and your forefathers were poisonous snakes! How can people like you possibly escape from the punishment of hell?! It's impossible, of course.
\v 34 For that reason, pay attention! I'll keep sending you prophets, wise people, and teachers of God's Word. You'll kill some of them, crucify some of them,\f + \fr 23:34 \fk crucify \ft See the footnote for Mat. 27:22.\f* and whip some others in your synagogues. You'll persecute some of the others, and chase them from one city to another.
\p
\v 35-36 “For that reason, God has decided to lay the most severe punishment on you Jewish leaders, for the blood of all the righteous people you've killed, because they taught in His name. I'm telling you the truth: You who've witnessed My ministry will bear the punishment for all the murders of righteous people in our history, beginning with the murder of Abel up to the murder of Zechariah,\f + \fr 23:35-36 \fk Abel … Zechariah \ft Abel was the first person to be murdered in the Old Testament, and Zechariah was the last to be killed. (Gen. 4:8; 2 Chron. 24:21)\f* the son of Barachiah. (Abel was killed just because he lived righteously, whereas Zechariah was the person you killed between the Holy Room and the altar in God's Temple.)”
\s Jesus warns the people in Jerusalem
\r (Luke 13:34-35)
\p
\v 37 “Hey, all of you residents of Jerusalem: You're the ones who always kill God's prophets and messengers who come and prophesy in the name of My Father! You've stoned some to death, and you've killed some in other ways. I've stretched out My hands to hug and protect you many times, like a mother hen gathers her chicks and protects them under her wings, yet you always refuse to come to Me.
\v 38 Since the time of Moses, God has camped among you people of Israel, but pay attention: The time has almost come, when God won't dwell here in His Temple anymore.
\v 39 Believe this, that from now on you won't see Me again until I return, and you'll say, ‘May God bless our King, who's coming to represent the Lord!’”\x + Ps. 118:26; Mat. 21:9\x*
