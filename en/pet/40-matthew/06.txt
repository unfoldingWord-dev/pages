\c 6
\s Jesus teaches about how to do good deeds
\p
\v 1 “Be careful! Don't show off your good deeds in public so that people notice you and praise you. If you do that, you won't receive a reward for your good deeds from your Father who's in heaven.
\p
\v 2 Whenever you give to the poor, don't do it for show like what's done by people who only pretend to be good people. They like to give to the poor in public— in the synagogues or at street corners, accompanied by a trumpet sound. They do that so that they'll be seen and praised by many people. I'm telling you the truth: That's their only reward.
\v 3 Instead, when you give to the poor, give secretly. Your left hand doesn't need to know what your right hand is doing.
\v 4 By that I mean, other people don't need to know about your gift to the poor. And your Father— who sees everything you do secretly, will reward you.”
\s Jesus teaches how to pray
\r (Luke 11:2-4)
\p
\v 5 “Don't pray like people who only pretend to be good people, because they like to stand showing off by praying in public— in the synagogues and on street corners. I'm telling you the truth: That's their only reward.
\v 6 But when you pray, go into the innermost room of your house, shut the door, and pray to your Father who's in that hidden place. And your Father— who sees what's done in that hidden place, will reward you.
\p
\v 7 And when you pray, don't pray like people who don't yet know God. For they repeat their requests over and over many times, because they think that God will hear better if the prayers are repeated.
\v 8 So don't imitate them. For your Father already knows what you need before you ask for it.
\v 9 For that reason, you should pray like this:
\q1 ‘Our Father who's in heaven,\f + \fr 6:9 \fk you … our \ft Because Jesus uses 'our' in this example of prayer, the reader could have the opinion that this prayer is only to be used when praying together in a service. That opinion is wrong. Jesus and our Father God are definitely happy to receive it when we pray following the example of this prayer, and adapt it to whoever's praying. So you can pray, “My Father in heaven,” and “Forgive me for all my wrong-doings …” and so on.\f*
\q2 may everyone honor You\f + \fr 6:9 \fk You \ft Literally, “Your name.” According to the Jewish culture, at the time of Jesus, 'Your name' here meant the whole personality of God.\f* as God who's holy.
\q1
\v 10 May you come and rule as King,
\q2 and may Your will be done on this earth,
\q2 just as Your will is always done in heaven.
\q1
\v 11 Give us the food that we need today.
\q1
\v 12 And forgive each of us for our wrong-doings,
\q2 just as we forgive people who've done wrong to us.’
\q1
\v 13 And don't allow us to be tempted to do evil,
\q2 but save us from the power of the devil.
\q1 [For You're the only One who has power to rule as king over everything,
\q2 and You're the only one worthy to be praised forever and ever. Amen.]\f + \fr 6:13 \fk For … Amen \ft The traditional ending of this prayer wasn't written by Matthew, and it isn't found in the best ancient copies.\f*
\m
\v 14 Forgive people who've wronged you. For if you forgive them, your Father who's in heaven will also forgive you.
\v 15 But if you don't forgive people who've wronged you, your Father who's in heaven won't forgive you either.”
\s Jesus teaches how to fast
\p
\v 16 “When you fast, don't show a sad face, or rub your face with mud, like people do who only pretend to be good. Those who do that only want to show off that they're fasting. I'm telling you the truth: That's their only reward.
\v 17 Instead, when you fast, comb your hair and wash your face as usual.
\v 18 In that way, no one will know that you're fasting, but only your Father who's unseen will know it, for He sees everything that's done in a hidden way, and He'll reward you.”
\s You can't be a servant of God and be a servant of money at the same time
\r (Luke 11:34-36, 12:33-34, 16:13)
\p
\v 19 “Don't collect treasures for yourself in this world— where moths and rust will destroy your treasures, and thieves can break in and steal them.
\v 20 Instead, collect treasures for yourself in heaven— where moths and rust can't destroy them, and thieves can't break in and steal them.
\v 21 For where your treasures are, your heart and thoughts are there too.
\p
\v 22 “Your eye is like a window that allows light into your body. If your eye is good, your whole life will be lighted up.
\v 23 But if your eye is damaged because of looking here and there greedily, your whole life will become very dark. If the window of your body prevents light from entering, the darkness in your heart will be so great!
\p
\v 24 “Pay attention to this example: It's not good for a person to have two masters, because it's impossible for him to serve the two of them well. He'll love and be faithful to one of the masters, of course, but will hate and not care for the other master. In the same way, you can't be a servant of God, and be a servant of money at the same time.”
\s Put God's kingdom first
\r (Luke 12:22-34)
\p
\v 25 “For that reason I'm telling you: Don't worry about whatever needs you have in your life, such as food and drinks. And don't worry about everything you need for your body either, such as clothing. For there are things in your life that are more important than food and clothing, of course.\x + Matt.6:33\x*
\v 26 Pay attention to the birds. They don't need to plant or harvest, and they don't need to store food in a storeroom. Your Father who's in heaven provides food for the birds. So know this: You're far more valuable in your Father's sight than the birds.
\v 27 And with all of your worrying, you aren't able to add one second to your age. So you don't need to worry!
\p
\v 28 “For example, why're you worried about clothing? Notice that wild plants don't need to work hard to make their own clothes, because God makes those plants produce beautiful flowers.
\v 29 I'm telling you the truth: King Solomon— even though he was extremely rich, didn't wear clothing as beautiful as even one of those flowers.
\v 30 Since God gives beauty like that to wild plants, even though they live for such a short time, then wilt and are thrown into a fire, then you can be certain that He pays more attention to you than to those plants. And He'll supply clothes for you too— you who don't believe in God enough!
\p
\v 31 “So no need to worry like that and say, ‘What'll I eat?’ Or ‘What'll I drink?’ Or ‘What'll I wear?’
\v 32 All of those things are a constant worry for people who don't know God. However, your Father who's in heaven already knows that you need all those things.
\v 33 But the thing that you must make your top priority is to live in a way that's proper and right as a citizen of God's kingdom,\f + \fr 6:33 \fk God's kingdom \ft is 'the rule of God' over everyone who obeys Him. Just as Jesus obeyed the will of God to the point that He surrendered Himself as a sacrificial offering, so each of God's people also have to surrender themselves to follow His will. (Mrk. 8:34; Rom. 10:9-10, 12:1-2). In that way, we prove that we've become citizens of God's kingdom, and are worthy to receive everything God has promised to His chosen people, from the beginning. When Jesus comes back, God will rule visibly in this world— just as He always rules in heaven. See Dan.7:13-14, Matt. 6:10\f* and everything you need will be given to you too.
\v 34 So, you don't need to worry about tomorrow, for everyday has its own struggles. It's enough to go through today's struggles, don't add the struggles of the days to come.”
