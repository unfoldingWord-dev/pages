\c 17
\s Jesus appears to be shining on top of a mountain
\r (Mark 9:2-13; Luke 9:28-36)
\p
\v 1 Six days later, Jesus went with Peter, James, and John— the brother of James, up a high mountain to be alone.
\v 2 Then the three of them saw Jesus' body and clothing. His face shone like the sun, and His clothing became shining white, as if it glowed.
\v 3 Suddenly, His three disciples saw the Prophets Moses and Elijah talking to Jesus.
\p
\v 4 Then Peter said to Jesus, “Wow, Teacher, it's so wonderful that we're here together! If You want, I'll make three shelters here— one for You, one for Moses, and one more for Elijah.”
\p
\v 5 While Peter was talking, suddenly a very bright, white cloud came down and covered them. And a voice was heard from inside the cloud that said, “This is My Son, whom I love so much. He's the one who pleases My heart, so listen closely to Him.”
\p
\v 6 When the three of them heard that voice, they were very afraid, and bowed down with their faces to the ground.
\v 7 But Jesus came and touched them and said, “Stand up, and don't be afraid!”
\v 8 When they opened their eyes and lifted their heads, they saw Jesus all alone.
\v 9 While all of them were coming down from the mountain, Jesus strictly ordered them, “Don't tell anyone about what you saw on top of this mountain, until the Son of Man— who I am, comes back to life after death.”
\p
\v 10 Then those three disciples asked Him, “Why do the Law experts teach that the Prophet Elijah must come first, before the King of Salvation arrives?”\f + \fr 17:10 \fk Prophet Elijah must come first … \fk That teaching comes from Mal. 3:1, 4:5-6.\f*
\p
\v 11 Jesus answered them, “It's true, Elijah has to come earlier to prepare everything, before the Son of Man comes.
\v 12 But I'm telling you that Elijah already came earlier, before Me, but people didn't know him, and they treated him as they pleased! And they will cause Me— the Son of Man, to suffer in the same way.”
\v 13 That was when the disciples finally understood that He was talking about John the Baptist, who replaced the Prophet Elijah.
\s Jesus drives a demon from a boy who was sick with epilepsy
\r (Mark 9:14-29; Luke 9:37-43a)
\p
\v 14 When Jesus and His three disciples came back to the crowd, a man came and bowed down in front of Him.
\v 15 The man said, “Lord, have compassion on my child. He's sick with epilepsy and really suffers. He often falls into fire or into water.
\v 16 I brought him to Your disciples, but they weren't able to heal him.”
\p
\v 17 Then Jesus said to them, “This is no joke, you're really lost and don't believe in God! How long do I have to be patient with you! Haven't I been with you long enough! Bring that child here.”
\v 18 Then Jesus firmly ordered the demon to get out of the boy. At that very moment, the demon came out and the boy was healed!
\p
\v 19 Later we disciples of His came to Jesus privately way and asked, “Why couldn't we drive out that demon?”
\p
\v 20-21 Jesus said, “You couldn't drive out that demon because you don't have enough faith in the power of God. I'm telling you the truth: If you only have faith as big as a mustard seed,\f + \fr 17:20-21 \fk sawi seed \fk See the note in Matt. 13:31.\f* you can say to this mountain, ‘Move over there!’ And that mountain will move, of course. That way there won't be anything that you won't be able to do.”\f + \fr 17:20-21 \fk Verse 21 \ft Several ancient manuscripts add these words: “But demons of that type only can be expelled with prayer and fasting.” This addition came from Mrk. 9:29. Eventually over time those words became counted as verse 21.\f*
\s Jesus tells about His death again
\r (Mark 9:30-31; Luke 9:43b–45)
\p
\v 22 One time, when Jesus and we disciples of His were together in Galilee, He said to us, “I— the Son of Man, will be turned over into the hands of evil people.
\v 23 They'll kill Me, but on the third day I'll be raised up from death.” We were very sad to hear those words of His.
\s The teaching of Jesus about taxes
\p
\v 24 After Jesus returned with us to Capernaum, the time came to pay the annual tax for God's Temple. The people who collected it came to Peter and asked, “Does your teacher always pay the annual tax for God's Temple, or not?”
\p
\v 25 Peter answered, “He always pays it!”
\p Then when Peter went into the house where Jesus was staying, before he had a chance to speak, Jesus asked him, “In your opinion, from what kind of people do kings always collect taxes?— Do they collect it from their own close family, or from other people?”
\p
\v 26 Peter answered, “From other people.”
\p So Jesus said, “So we, the children of the greatest King, are free of that tax!
\v 27 But in order not to offend the feelings of those who collect that donation, go catch a fish in the lake. When you catch the first fish, open its mouth, and you'll find a silver coin that's enough to pay the annual tax for two people. Then give that money to them as payment for taxes for you and Me.”
