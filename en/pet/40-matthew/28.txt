\c 28
\s Jesus lives again, and reveals Himself to the women
\p
\v 1 Very early Sunday morning, after the Sabbath day was over, Mary— from the village of Magdalene, and the other Mary who was mentioned\x + Mat. 27:56, 61\x* went to see Jesus' tomb.
\p
\v 2 Suddenly, an unusual earthquake happened, when an angel came down from heaven and rolled the stone cover away from the door of the tomb. After that, he sat on top of the stone.
\v 3 The angel's body shone as bright as lightning, and his clothes were very white, like a white cloud.
\v 4 The guards were extremely frightened, to the point that they trembled and fainted, like dead men.
\p
\v 5 Then the angel said to the two women, “Don't be afraid! I know you're looking for Jesus, who was crucified.
\v 6 He isn't here, because He has been raised up by God, like He had said. Come in and see the place where His body had been placed.
\v 7 Now go quickly, and tell His disciples this, ‘Jesus has been raised up from the dead, and now He's going ahead of you to Galilee! You'll meet Him there.’ Pay attention to the news I've told you.”
\p
\v 8 Then the the two women quickly left the tomb. They ran to tell us disciples of His what had happened, feeling fearful mixed with gladness.
\v 9 On their way, Jesus suddenly met them and said, “Greetings.” So they approached Him, knelt down, held onto His feet and worshiped Him.
\v 10 Then Jesus said to them, “Don't be afraid! Go and tell My followers\f + \fr 28:10 \fk My followers \ft Literally, “My brothers.” Here that word doesn't mean the biological brothers of Jesus, but the disciples, and the brothers and sisters who believed in Him.\f* to go to Galilee. And they'll meet Me there.”
\s The guard soldiers' false story
\p
\v 11 While the two women were on there way to tell us what had happened, some of the soldiers guarding the tomb went to the city and reported to the chief priests about everything that had happened.
\v 12 So the chief priests quickly held a meeting with the Jewish leaders where they decided to give a lot of bribe money to those guards,
\v 13 with this order, “You must tell people this, ‘His disciples came in the night and stole His body while we were sleeping.’
\v 14 And if the governor hears this story, we'll talk to him so that you won't be punished.”
\v 15 Then they accepted the bribe money, and spread the false story like they were ordered to do, and up till now that false story is still spread among Jewish circles.
\s Jesus sends out His disciples
\r (Mark 16:14-18; Luke 24:36-49; John 20:19-23; Acts 1:6-8)
\p
\v 16 Then we eleven disciples of Jesus' went to a hill in Galilee that Jesus had told us about.
\v 17 When we met Jesus on that hill, we knelt down to worship Him, even though it was so amazing that some of us had a hard time believing this was actually happening.
\v 18 Then Jesus approached us and said, “God has given all authority to Me to rule over all of His creation— both things in heaven and things on earth.
\v 19 For that reason, go and teach people from every ethnic group so that they'll become My followers. Baptize them as followers of Me, My Father, and the Holy Spirit.\f + \fr 28:19 \fk as followers … \ft Literally, “in the name of the Father, in My name and in the name of the Holy Spirit.” According to the Jewish culture at the time of Jesus, 'name' meant the whole identity. Jesus didn't mean here isn't that it's just enough to state those three Names when people are baptized. At the time of Jesus, baptism was a ceremony which showed that the person being baptized had become a follower who would be faithful to the Trinity as named. Those three names don't show that there are three Gods, and don't show that one God has three names, nor that God is divided into three parts either. Those three ideas are wrong. What's clear is this: In His Word, the One and Only God has shown Himself to mankind in three Persons, and this can't be fully understood by human thinking.\f*
\v 20 Teach them to obey everything I've taught you, and be sure of this: I'll always be with you, even to the end of the world.”
