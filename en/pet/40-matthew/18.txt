\s Character of the person who is most important in God's kingdom
\r (Mark 9:33-37, 42-48; Luke 9:46-48, 17:1-2)
\p
\v 1 At that time, we disciples of Jesus came to Him and asked, “When You set up God's kingdom on this earth, which one of us will be number one?”
\p
\v 2 So He called a small child to come to Him, and placed him between us.
\v 3 Then He said, “I'm telling you the truth: If each of you doesn't repent of your own self-importance, and become humble like children, you won't become citizens of God's kingdom.
\v 4 For the person who's first in God's kingdom is the person who humbles himself like this little child.”
\p
\v 5 “If you accept and serve\f + \fr 18:5 \fk accept and serve \fk Literally, “welcome / accept.” In the Greek language, the root meaning of this word is to give hospitality and food to someone that you don't know yet.\f* a little child like this, for the purpose of glorifying My name, you've accepted and served Me.
\v 6 If a person causes a young child who believes in Me to sin, that person will receive a very harsh punishment from God. Before he does commit such a great sin, it would be better for a huge stone to be tied around his neck,\f + \fr 18:6 \fk huge stone \fk Literally, “a donkey's grinding stone.” This is a huge stone that's turned by the power of a donkey to grind grains of wheat to make flour.\f* and for him to be thrown into the deepest ocean. To experience that trouble would be much less than to experience eternal punishment from God for causing a person who isn't yet mature spiritually to fall into sin!
\p
\v 7 “A person who causes another person in this world to sin is so unfortunate! There'll always be temptations in this world, of course, but the person who causes another person to sin is very unfortunate.
\v 8 If your hand or foot causes you to sin, it would be better for you to cut it off and throw it away, so that you'll have eternal life in heaven. It's better to enter eternal life without a whole hand or foot, than for you to have a complete body, but be thrown into the fire of hell that burns forever.
\v 9 And if one of your eyes causes you to sin, dig it out and throw that eye away. It would be better for you to enter God's kingdom with just one eye, than to have two eyes, yet be thrown into the fire of hell.
\s Story of the lost lamb
\r (Luke 15:3-7)
\p
\v 10-11 “Beware, don't look down on any little children like these. For I'm telling you that they each have an angel who's always ready to speak to My Father in heaven.”\f + \fr 18:10-11 \fk Ayat 11 \fk Several ancient manuscripts add these words, and after a long time they became counted as verse 11: “For the Son of Man has come to save people who're lost.”\f*
\p
\v 12 “If you have a hundred sheep, and one of them strays, what would you do? You would leave the ninety-nine sheep on the hill, of course, and then go find the sheep that strayed.
\v 13 And I'm telling you the truth: If you succeed in finding that sheep, you'll be happier because of finding that one sheep, for sure, than for the ninty-nine who aren't lost.
\v 14 It's the same for your Father who's in heaven. He doesn't want even one of the little children who believe in Him to be lost and perish.”
\s The way to rebuke your brother in the faith who's wrong
\r (Luke 17:3)
\p
\v 15 “If your brother in the faith does wrong to you, go to him in a private way, and tell him what he did wrong. If he admits his wrong and repents, you'll be at peace with your brother again.
\v 16 But if he doesn't want to admit his wrong, meet with him again, along with one or two other brothers in the faith. Do that like the Law which says, ‘Every wrong has to be supported by two or three eyewitnesses, and only then can the problem be decided on in an official way.’\x + Deut. 19:15\x*
\v 17 If he still refuses to hear those eyewitnesses too, tell the whole church about it. And if he doesn't want to hear the advice of the church either, all the brothers in the faith should distance themselves from him— just like the Jews don't have relationships with people that don't know God, or with tax collectors.
\v 18 I'm telling you the truth: Every door that the church locks on earth, will be locked in heaven too, and every door that the church opens on earth, will be opened in heaven too.\f + \fr 18:18 \fk verse 18 \fk See the footnote for Mat. 16:19.\f*
\v 19 I'm also telling you that if two or more of you are of the same mind to ask for something in prayer, then that thing will be done by My Father who's in heaven.
\v 20 For if two or more of you gather and pray with the purpose of glorifying My name, it means that I'm there among you too.”
\s The parable of the employee who didn't forgive his fellowman
\p
\v 21 Then Peter approached Jesus and asked, “Lord, if my brother in the faith keeps doing wrong to me, how many times do I have to forgive him? Is seven times enough?”
\p
\v 22 Jesus answered, “Seven times? No. Seventy-seven times? No. But keep forgiving without counting.\f + \fr 18:22 \fk without counting \fk Literally, “seventy times seven times, which is 490 times.”\f*
\p
\v 23 “Let Me explain why I answered like that: The situation between brothers in the faith in God's kingdom is like this story: One day, there was a king who wanted to settle all of the accounting of money that he had loaned to his employees.\f + \fr 18:23 \fk his employees \fk Literally, “his slaves.” At the time Jesus told this parable, many high government officials were slaves of the king. In order that the situation of this parable doesn't seem too strange for today's readers, the word 'employee' is used.\f*
\v 24 When the accounting began, there was an employee who had a debt of thousands of kilograms of gold.\f + \fr 18:24 \fk thousands of kilograms of gold \fk Literally, “10,000 talents.” One talent is the same as 26-36 kilograms of gold, silver or copper coins. So the total was around 300,000 kilograms.\f* So that employee was brought before the king,
\v 25 but the employee wasn't able to pay his debt. Then the king commanded his soldiers to sell the employee, his wife and children, including all of his possessions. Then the proceeds from the sale would be used to pay his debt.
\p
\v 26 “So the employee knelt down and pleaded, ‘Oh, Sir, please be patient! I'll pay all my debt!’
\v 27 The king's heart was touched and he had compassion on him, so he and his family were released and all of his debt was erased.
\p
\v 28 “Then what happened to that employee whose debt was erased? He went out and met one of his friends, who was a fellow employee of the kingdom, who owed him just a hundred silver coins. He grabbed him, and choked him saying, ‘Pay your debt!’
\p
\v 29 “His friend knelt down and pleaded, ‘Oh, Sir, please be patient! I'll pay all my debt!’
\p
\v 30 “But he wouldn't be patient. Instead, he reported his friend to a judge in order to put him in prison until he paid all his debt.
\p
\v 31 “When the other employees saw what had happened, they were very sad. Then they reported what happened to the king.
\v 32 So the king called the evil employee and said, ‘Hey— you evil employee! I erased all your debt just because you asked me for patience,
\v 33 o you should have had compassion on your friend too, just like I had compassion on you!’
\v 34 The king was so angry that he ordered the evil employee to be imprisoned, and the prison guard was also ordered to beat him every day until his debt was paid in full.
\p
\v 35 “My Father in heaven will do the same thing to each of you, if you don't wholeheartedly forgive everyone who does wrong to you.”
