\c 11
\p
\v 1 After Jesus finished instructing us twelve disciples of His, He left that place and went to cities in the region of Galilee to teach and tell the people there about the Good News of God.
\s John the Baptist presents a question, and Jesus teaches about John's ministry
\r (Luke 7:18-35)
\p
\v 2 John the Baptist was in prison at that time, and he heard about the work done by the Christ.\f + \fr 11:2 \fk the Christ \fk See note in Matt. 1:16.\f* So John sent some of his disciples to Jesus
\v 3 to ask, “Sir, are you the Sent One whose coming was promised, or should we still wait for another person?”
\p
\v 4 Jesus answered, “Go back to John and tell him what you've heard and seen for yourselves today:
\v 5 that many blind people now see, paralyzed people are walking, people who were sick with contagious skin diseases have been healed, people who were deaf can hear, dead people have been resurrected, and the Good News of God is being told to poor people.
\v 6 And tell John that everyone who doesn't have doubts about Me is truly blessed.”
\p
\v 7 As soon as John's disciples left, Jesus began speaking to the crowd about John. He said, “Before My ministry began, you had already gone out far into the desert to see someone else— right? You didn't go so far just to see some ordinary thing— right?! Because people don't walk that far just to see a blade of grass that's blown by the wind, of course.
\v 8 What were you really looking for at that time? You didn't go to see a person dressed in really beautiful clothing, of course, because people who wear clothes like that aren't in the desert, but are in a king's palace!
\v 9 So what were you looking for there? A prophet— right?! Yes, I'm telling you that John's status was far more important than a prophet's,
\v 10 because he's the one who was meant by the verse in the Holy Bible which says,
\q1 ‘Pay attention: I'll send My messenger first,
\q2 so that he can prepare the way before I send You.’\x + Mal.3:1\x*
\p
\v 11-12 “From the time John the Baptist began serving until now, the work to set up God's kingdom grew very quickly, even though people strongly opposed it and tried to overpower it.\f + \fr 11:11-12 \fk Verse 12 \fk Can also be translated: From the time John the Baptist began serving until now, people actively opposed the work to set up God's kingdom in this world, and tried to overpower it.\f* I'm telling you the truth: John the Baptist is greater than everyone who has ever been born. But in the new kingdom that God has already begun to set up, everyone who becomes a member of His kingdom will be considered greater than John— even a person of the very lowest status.
\v 13 For all of the prophecies in the Law and the books of the prophets pointed to this present age in which God has begun to set up His kingdom. And this age began at the beginning of John the Baptist's ministry.
\v 14 If you're ready to accept this teaching, John was the person who replaced the Prophet Elijah— that is, he's the one whose coming was promised.\f + \fr 11:14 \fk Elijah … In Mal. 4:5-6, it's written that the Prophet Elijah would come before the Judgment Day.\f*
\v 15 You have ears— right?! So listen really closely!
\p
\v 16 “Now I'll give you an example that illustrates most of you who live in this age. Most of you are like two groups of children who're playing in a yard. One group calls to the other group,
\q1
\v 17 ‘Every time we invite you to play something,
\q2 you never want to play!
\q1 If we play a dance song with the flute,
\q2 you don't want to dance.
\q1 But when we pretend to play funeral music,
\q2 you don't want to pretend you're mourning.’
\m
\v 18 That means you reject the work of God— whatever its form, because when John the Baptist was serving the Lord among you, he often fasted, and didn't drink strong drinks. But you said, ‘He's possessed by a demon.’
\v 19 Then I— Son of Man came, and I eat and drink strong drinks like normal people do, but you say, ‘Look! He's eating and drinking greedily. He's also the friend of tax collectors and other sinful people.’ Even so, God's wisdom is always proven to be true by its results.”
\s People who don't want to believe, beware!
\r (Luke 10:13-15)
\p
\v 20 At that time, Jesus gave a harsh rebuke to the cities where He had done more miracles because many of the residents of those cities didn't want to repent.
\v 21 He said, “You people of Chorazin are so unfortunate! You people of Bethsaida are so unfortunate! God's punishment will be so terrible for you later on, because if the miracles which I've already done among you had also happened in former times in Tyre and Sidon, then they would have sincerely repented and wept over their sins long ago!\f + \fr 11:21 \fk sincerely repented and wept over their sins \fk Literally, “repented with (by wearing) sack cloth and ashes.” It means that they would have sincerely mourned for their sins, like when people mourn because of the death of a close relative. At that time, they wore rough cloth which was normally used just for sacks, and placed ashes on their heads.\f*
\v 22 So I'm telling you the truth that on the Judgment Day, the punishment that will fall on you will be far harsher than the punishment that will fall on the residents of Tyre and Sidon.
\p
\v 23 “And you residents of Capernaum think that you'll be lifted up so that you'll get great respect in heaven. No! You'll be thrown into hell,\f + \fr 11:23 \fk hell Literally, “Hades,” the place for every evil person after dying. See Luke 10:15, 16:23; Rev. 20:13-14.\f* because if the miracles that I've done among you had happened in Sodom in former times, they would have already repented, and that city would've remained until now.
\v 24 So I'm telling you the truth that on the Judgment Day, the punishment that will fall on you will be far harsher than the punishment that will fall on the residents of Sodom.”
\s Jesus invites His disciples to rest
\r (Luke 10:21-22)
\p
\v 25 At the same time, Jesus said again, “Oh Father, I praise You, the Lord of heaven and earth, because You've hidden these teachings about Your kingdom from people who're wise and have much knowledge, but You reveal these things to whoever's ready to accept true teaching with innocent hearts, like little children.
\v 26 Oh Father it's true, because that's what pleases Your heart.
\p
\v 27 “Everything has been turned over to Me by the Father. No one knows Me— His Son, except the Father. And no one knows My Father except Me, and the people whom I want to introduce to Him.
\p
\v 28 “Come to Me, all of you who're weary from bearing heavy troubles, because I'll help you overcome each of those troubles and you'll be relieved.
\v 29 Submit to Me and rely on Me.\f + \fr 11:29 \fk Submit to Me and rely on Me \fk Literally, “Accept My yoke.” A yoke is made of wood and is used to join two cows or water buffalo, so that they work together to pull a heavy load. The power of two animals is greater for plowing land, or moving something heavy. Jesus' illustration can be interpreted as that He'll take part in bearing the burdens of each one of us. Or for Jewish people, the yoke also illustrated the heavy burden that they experienced because of trying to keep all the rules in the Law. (See Acts 15:10; Gal. 5:1.)\f* Learn from Me, because I'm meek and humble, so you'll be relieved.
\v 30 For if you submit to Me and rely on Me, your heavy burdens will become lightweight, and the burden I give you is lightweight.”
