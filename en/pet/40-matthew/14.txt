\s Herod hears about Jesus
\r (Mark 6:14-16; Luke 9:7-9)
\p
\v 1 At that time, Herod— the king of the region of Galilee, heard the news about Jesus. He had already killed John the Baptist before this time.\f + \fr 14:1 \fk Before this … \fk The information that Matthew tells in verses 3-12 was already known by the first readers. It's expressed here to help today's readers understand verse 2.\f*
\v 2 Then Herod said to his servants, “That man is John the Baptist, for sure. Apparently he has risen from the dead, but he's now calling himself Jesus.\f + \fr 14:2 \fk calling himself Jesus \fk Soon after John was killed, Jesus suddenly became well known as a man who performed many miracles. So some people who had never heard of Jesus thought that maybe John had immediately come back from heaven and was calling himself by a new name. At the time of Jesus, there were many other people named Jesus. Jesus' name in Greek is the same as the name Joshua in Hebrew. The two names mean “God is My Savior.”\f* That's why he can do those miracles.”
\s How John the Baptist was killed
\r (Mark 6:17-29)
\p
\v 3-4 Long before this event, Herod had run off with Herodiana,\f + \fr 14:3-4 \fk Herodiana—\fk This name is often written in the Indonesian language as “Herodias.” The spelling Herodiana was chosen so that it's obvious that this is a woman's name.\f* the wife of his own younger brother, Philip. Then John the Baptist rebuked him over and over again, “According to the Law, you can't marry the wife of your younger brother.”\f + \fr 14:3-4 \fk Law … the wife of your younger brother \fk God forbid a man to marry or have sex with the wife of his brother, (Lev. 18:16; 20:21), except if his brother had died and had no children. Then he could marry the widow of his brother to have children that would be considered to be children from the brother who had died. Deut. 25:5–6; Mark 12:18-27).\f* For that reason, Herod ordered his soldiers to arrest John and put him in prison, bound with chains.
\v 5 Herod wanted to kill John, but he was afraid of the crowd who believed that John was a prophet.
\p
\v 6 After some time, and on the day of Herod's birthday party, the daughter of Herodiana danced in front of Herod and his guests. That really pleased Herod,
\v 7 so herod promised with an oath to give her whatever she wanted.
\v 8 Because she was influenced by her mother, the princess said to Herod, “I ask that the head of John the Baptist be cut off, put on a large plate, and brought here!”
\p
\v 9 When Herod heard her request, he really regretted it. But because he had taken an oath in front of all his guests, he gave the command to fulfill the princess' request.
\v 10 He ordered his soldiers to cut off John's head in prison.
\v 11 Then the head was brought on a large plate and given to the princess, and she gave it to her mother.
\v 12 When John the Baptist's followers heard the news, they went to the prison to take John's body, and they buried it. Then they went to Jesus and told Him what had happened.
\s Jesus feeds more than five thousand people
\r (Mark 6:30-44; Luke 9:10-17; John 6:1-14)
\p
\v 13 After Jesus heard the news of John's death, He went with us disciples of His by boat, to a quiet place. But the people heard that He had gone, so they left their cities to follow us on land.
\v 14 When Jesus got out of the boat, He saw how many people had gathered there and He had compassion on them, so He healed those who were sick.
\p
\v 15 Late in the afternoon, we came and said to Him, “It's already late afternoon, and this is a remote area, so it would be best if we order them to go to the villages to buy food.”
\p
\v 16 Jesus said to us, “They don't need to go, just feed them.”
\p
\v 17 We answered, “We only have five pieces of bread and two fish.”
\p
\v 18 He said, “Bring the bread and fish to Me.”
\v 19 Then Jesus ordered the crowd to sit down on the grass. He took the five pieces of bread and the two fish, and then looked up to the sky to thank God for the food. After that, He tore the bread and the fish and then gave it to us disciples of His so then we distributed the bread to the crowd.
\v 20 Everyone ate until they were satisfied. After that, we gathered the leftover food, which was as much as twelve baskets full.
\v 21 The total number of people who ate was about five thousand men, not even including women and children.
\s Jesus walks on the water
\r (Mark 6:45-52; John 6:15-21)
\p
\v 22 Then Jesus ordered us disciples of His to get into the boat first, and go ahead of Him to the other side while He ordered the crowd to go home.
\v 23 After that, He climbed up a hill alone to pray. As night was coming, He was still alone there.
\v 24 At the same time, our boat was already far from shore, and it was being struck by waves because a strong wind was blowing from the opposite direction.
\p
\v 25 Very early in the morning, He came toward us, walking on top of the water.
\v 26 When we saw Him walking on top of the water, we were really afraid and cried out, “It's a ghost!”
\p
\v 27 But Jesus immediately said to us, “Take courage in your hearts! It's Me, so don't be afraid.”
\p
\v 28 Then Peter said to Him, “Lord, if it's really You, order me to come walking to You on top of the water!”
\v 29 He said, “Come here.”
\p Then Peter got out of the boat and began to walk on top of the water toward Jesus.
\v 30 But when he saw the huge waves that were blown by the strong wind, he became frightened and began to sink, and then he cried, “Lord, help me!”
\p
\v 31 Jesus immediately held Peter and said, “You don't have enough faith in Me! Why do you doubt?”
\p
\v 32 After Jesus and Peter got into the boat, the strong wind just stopped blowing.
\v 33 So we knelt down to worship Him and said, “You really are God's Son!”
\s Jesus heals sick people
\r (Mark 6:53-56)
\p
\v 34 After arriving on the other side of the lake, we got out of the boat on the Gennesaret beach.
\v 35 When the people there recognized that He was Jesus, they went through the whole region telling people that Jesus had returned. Then all the sick people were brought to Him.
\v 36 And they asked Him just to let them touch the edge of His robe. And everyone who touched Him got well.
