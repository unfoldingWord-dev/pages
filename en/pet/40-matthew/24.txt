\c 24
\s Jesus teaches about the end of the age
\r (Mark 13:1-31; Luke 21:5-33)
\p
\v 1 After Jesus left the courtyard of God's Temple, as we walked, we disciples of His went up to Him and said, “Wow, God's Temple and all the buildings in this complex are so great!”
\p
\v 2 Then Jesus answered, “Yes, pay close attention to the greatness of these buildings! I'm telling you the truth: The time is coming when everything you see will be torn down— until there won't even be one stone on top of another.”
\p
\v 3 After that, Jesus went with us to the Mount of Olives. While He was sitting there alone, we came to Him and asked, “Please tell to us when this disaster will happen, and what signs will happen before You return and before this world ends?”
\p
\v 4 Jesus answered, “You should all be watching, so that you aren't deceived!
\v 5 For many people will appear and say, ‘I'm the Christ that you're waiting for’, and they'll lead many people astray like that.
\v 6 You'll hear about wars going on, or which will happen, but don't be worried. For God has determined that those things must happen, of course. But those events aren't signs that you're in the end times of the world.
\v 7 There'll be wars between tribes and countries. And later on there'll also be earthquakes and famines in various places.
\v 8 But all of those things are just the beginning. They're like a pregnant woman feeling pain when she's going to give birth, and then the pain gets even worse.
\p
\v 9 “At that time, people will hand you over to the authorities to be tortured— even to be killed. You'll be hated by all people groups because you believe in Me.
\v 10 Then many people will stop believing in Me because of that persecution, and people you had considered to be brothers in the faith will hate you and turn you over to the authorities.
\v 11 Many false prophets will appear, and they'll deceive many people.
\v 12 And because everyone will break the commands of God more and more, love between fellowmen will become lukewarm.
\v 13 But everyone who continues to believe and follow Me until the end of the world, or until the end of their lives, will be saved.
\v 14 The Good News of how God sets up His kingdom will be told in the whole world, so that people from every ethnic group have the opportunity to believe in the news of salvation. Only after that will the end of the world occur.
\p
\v 15 “I'm giving this sign to you: In agreement with the Prophet Daniel's prophecy, you'll see an enemy set up ‘something in God's Temple that truly defiles, and is a sign of destruction.’”\x + Dan. 9:27, 11:31, 12:11\x*
\q I, (Matthew), ask people who're reading this book to others: Please explain Daniel's prophecy to the listeners. Then Jesus continued His teaching:
\m
\v 16 “When you see that disaster take place, people who're in Jerusalem and the province of Judea should run away to the mountains.
\v 17 At that time, if any of you are on the terrace of your house,\f + \fr 24:17 \fk terrace of your house \ft Matthew literally wrote, “on the roof of your house”. In the land of Israel, the roofs of houses were flat, and were used like people in Indonesia use a terrace or a yard.\f* don't go back in to take anything. Just run away immediately!
\v 18 In the same way, if a person is working in a field, he shouldn't go back to his house to get his robe.
\v 19 At the time of that disaster, pity the women who're pregnant and nursing. They'll really suffer because it'll be so difficult for them to run away.
\v 20 Pray that this great trouble won't happen on a Sabbath Day, or in the winter. If so, it'll be too difficult for you to run away.
\v 21 For in those days, the most terrible trouble will happen. Trouble like this has never happened since the beginning of the world, until now. And after that, it'll never happen again.\x + Dan. 12:1\x*
\v 22 But because God has compassion on chosen people who still live on earth at that time, He decided that this terrible disaster won't be long. If it lasted too long, no one would be able to endure life on earth.
\p
\v 23 “At that time, if a person says, ‘Look! The Christ that we're waiting for is here,’ or, ‘He's over there,’ don't believe it.
\v 24 For later on, there'll be many people who come and do various great miracles in order to deceive you. They'll claim that they themselves are prophets who give news from God, or there'll also be those who claim, ‘I'm the Christ.’ Their deceptions will be truly amazing, to the point that God's chosen people will almost be led astray by them.
\v 25 Remember! I've told you about these things beforehand.”
\s Jesus teaches about His return from heaven
\r (Mark 13:24-31, Luke 21:25-28)
\p
\v 26 “So if people say to you, ‘Look! The Christ that we're waiting for is already in some remote area,’ don't go there. Or if a person says, ‘It's true! He's avoiding the crowds and He's in that house over there,’ don't believe it.
\v 27 For My (the Son of Man) coming won't happen in a secret way, but will be seen everywhere, like lightning that flashes from the east to the west.
\v 28 People often say, ‘Wherever there's a carcass, the birds of prey gather.’ In the same way, all of those things will be clear signs that My coming is near.\f + \fr 24:28 \fk In the same way … \ft The last sentence is added so that today's readers understand the meaning of the proverb that Jesus quoted.\f*
\p
\v 29 “And immediately after that time of great trouble,
\q1 ‘The sun will become dark,
\q2 and the moon won't shine anymore either.
\q1 The stars will even fall from the sky,
\q2 and all the leaders of the powers of darkness in the heavens will be thrown down.’\f + \fr 24:29 \fk Verse 29 \ft These things were prophesied in Is.13:10, 34:4; Ez. 32:7; Joel 2:10, 2:31, 3:15. The second line is literally, “and the authorities that are in the (levels of the) heavens will be shaken.”\f*
\p
\v 30 “At that time, a certain sign that will show My (the Son of Man) coming will appear in the sky. Then people from every ethnic group on earth, who don't believe in Me, will mourn in great fear, when they see Me coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.
\v 31 Then I'll order My angels to sound the trumpet of heaven, and gather all the people of God the Father. They'll be gathered from every place under heaven, even the corners from the east to the west, and from the north to the south.
\p
\v 32 “We can illustrate the signs of the end of the age with a fig tree. If the branches become soft and shoots from the branches can be seen, you know that summer's already near.
\v 33 In the same way, if you see those signs begin to happen, you should know that the time of My return is near.
\v 34 I'm telling you the truth: All those signs will happen while people of this age are still living.
\v 35 All of those things will definitely happen. Heaven and earth won't continue to exist, but these teachings of Mine will continue to be valid forever.”
\s Advice to be watching
\r (Mark 13:32-37; Luke 17:26-30, 34-36)
\p
\v 36 “But no one knows the day or hour of My return to this earth, not even the angels in heaven. Even I, God's Son, don't know. Just the Father knows.
\p
\v 37 “The situation when I— the Son of Man, return will be like what happened in the time of Noah.
\v 38-39 For in the days before that great flood came, people didn't ever think that a great disaster would fall on them. They were busy eating and drinking, men were marrying women and women were married by men. They kept living as usual until the time came when Noah went into that great ship, and the flood suddenly came and destroyed them. It'll be the same for people who don't believe in Me before I— the Son of Man, come back too.
\v 40 “Things like this will happen at the time of My coming: Two men will be working in a field; one will be carried away by the angels, and the other one will be left.
\v 41 And in another place, two women will be grinding wheat with a millstone; one will be carried away, and the other one will be left.
\p
\v 42 “For that reason, keep on guard and be ready, because you don't know the day your Master— who I am, will return.
\v 43 This is an important example: If the owner of a house knows that a thief will come tonight, he'll keep watching so that the thief can't break into his house.
\v 44 For that reason, you should always be ready too, because I— the Son of Man, will come when you aren't expecting it.”
\s Be a faithful and wise servant
\r (Luke 12:41-48)
\p
\v 45 “Prove that you're each My wise and faithful servants! If a land owner goes on a trip, certainly one of his wise and faithful servants will be entrusted with a special duty— which is to feed the other servants at the right time.
\v 46 If the master suddenly returns and finds his servant doing his duty, the master will be very happy with his servant and bless him.
\v 47 I'm telling you the truth: The master will entrust all of his possessions to that wise and faithful servant.
\p
\v 48 But if the servant who was given that duty is evil, he'll say in his heart, ‘My master won't return for a long time.’
\v 49 Then he'll begin to hit the other servants, and also eat and drink with drunkards.
\v 50 But without giving notice ahead of time, and on a day and hour when he isn't expected, the master will suddenly return.
\v 51 Then the master will destroy the evil servant, and make his fate the same as that of people who only pretend to be righteous people— that is, the master will throw him in a prison where the people continually weep and suffer severely.”
