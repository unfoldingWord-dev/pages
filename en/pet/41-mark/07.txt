\s The rules of the Jewish forefathers oppose God's teaching
\r (Mat. 15:1-9)
\p
\v 1 One day, people from the Pharisee group and the Law experts came from Jerusalem and gathered around Jesus.
\v 2 They noticed that some of Jesus' disciples were eating without following the Jewish ritual— which was that they didn't pour water over their hands according to the rules of their forefathers.\f + \fr 7:2 \fk didn't pour... \ft The two words used here from the Greek language mean 'normal hands' and 'pour'. The words 'normal hands' mean hands that hadn't yet been made holy again after being used for everyday work. According to Jewish tradition, 'normal hands' were considered ritually unclean, and needed to be made holy again before eating. The words that mean 'pour', meant that they hadn't yet done the cleansing ritual— which was to pour water over their hands. So in this verse, the problem was the Jewish custom of the forefathers— not that Jesus' disciples hands were dirty or needed to be washed with soap, and not because they were violating the Law of Moses.\f* Because of that, in their opinion Jesus' disciples had become ritually unclean before God.
\v 3 For all the Jews followed the forefathers' rules, of course, but the Pharisee group held very strictly to all of those rules. They couldn't eat without pouring water over their hands according to that rule.
\v 4 And if they came home from the market, they had to bathe in a special way before they ate. There were also many other rules of their forefathers, and they kept all of those rules, such as how to wash cups, kettles, and other cooking utensils.\f + \fr 7:4 \fk Difference in copies \ft After Mark wrote this book, many other people made copies to multiply the book. There's an ancient copy that adds “a reclining couch” to the objects that needed to be washed— which was used in those days while they lay down to eat. The word translated “ 'wash' here, is the same as the word 'baptize'. According to the cleansing custom of the Jewish religion, large objects could also be cleaned by ‘baptizing’. Even though in the beginning, this word meant 'immerse', the meaning of the word also included 'pour over' or 'cleanse in a religious way'.\f*
\p
\v 5 Then the Pharisees and the Law experts asked Jesus, “Why don't your disciples follow\f + \fr 7:5 \fk your \ft In this verse, the pronoun used to replace the name of Jesus begins with a small letter, because the one speaking wasn't a person who believed that Jesus was God's Son.\f* the rules of our forefathers— because they eat without pouring water over their hands first?”
\p
\v 6 But Jesus answered, “What the Prophet Isaiah said about you who only pretend to be good people was true, of course, when he wrote:
\q ‘This people group just honors Me with their words,
\q2 not with their hearts.
\v 7 They worship Me for no reason,
\q2 because they teach people to follow rules that are just made by humans,
\q2 and aren't My rules.’”\x + Is. 29:13\x*
\m
\v 8 Then Jesus said again, “You've left the commands of God behind to follow human rules alone.”
\p
\v 9 Then He said to them again, “You've become very clever at pretending to follow God's commands, but you're actually just following the rules taught by your forefathers.
\v 10 For example, it's written in the Law, ‘You must honor your father and mother. And if someone insults his father or mother, he must be sentenced to die.’\x + Ex. 20:12, 21:17; Deut. 5:16\x*
\v 11 But you teach that we don't need to obey our fathers and mothers in this matter: If someone says to his parents, ‘Whatever I should give to my mother and father I can't give anymore, because I've promised to give that to God.’
\v 12 By doing that, you're teaching other people not to help their parents anymore.
\v 13 So in continuing to follow the rules that our forefathers taught, you're no longer following the Ten Commandments that come from God. And there are still many other things that you're doing like that.”
\s Things that make people spiritually unclean in God's eyes
\r (Mat. 15:10-20)
\p
\v 14 Then Jesus called to the crowd again and said, “Listen to Me, all of you, and try to understand.
\v 15-16 Whatever you put into your own bodies through your mouths doesn't make you unclean spiritually before God. Instead, what comes out of yourselves is what determines whether you're spiritually unclean before God or not!”\f + \fr 7:16 \fk Difference in copies \ft There's an old copy of the Gospel of Mark which adds these words, which are included as verse 16: You already have ears— don't you! So listen closely.\f*
\p
\v 17 When Jesus left the crowd and entered a house, His disciples asked Him about the meaning of that statement.
\v 18 Then Jesus said, “Why do you find it's so hard understand too— when I said, 'Whatever goes into your bodies through your mouths doesn't make you spiritually unclean before God?!'
\v 19 For food doesn't enter the heart and mind, but enters the stomach, and then gets passed out into the toilet.” (By saying this, Jesus meant that there isn't any kind of food that can make people spiritually unclean before God. Every type of foods is permitted.)
\v 20 “But it's the things that come from inside yourself that make you spiritually unclean or not before God!
\v 21-22 For what comes from inside of you— that is from your hearts and minds, come from all of these kinds of desires
\q1 stealing, killing
\q1 having sex before marriage, adultery,
\q1 or wanting to do other lustful desires.
\q1 Also envy, greed,
\q1 wanting to do evil, wanting to deceive people,
\q1 wanting to insult other people, arrogance
\q1 and hard-headedness.\f + \fr 7:21-22 \fk list of sins \ft To make it easier to read, the order of these sins has been changed.\f*
\m
\v 23 All of those evil things come from within the hearts and thoughts of people, and that's what determines if you're spiritually unclean or not before God.”
\s Jesus tests the heart of a non-Jewish woman
\r (Mat. 15:21-28)
\p
\v 24 Then Jesus left that place and went to the region of Tyre. Jesus went into a house, and He didn't want people to know that He was there. But because He was already well-known everywhere, He couldn't hide Himself.
\v 25 There was a woman there whose daughter was possessed by an evil spirit. When she heard the news that Jesus had come, she immediately went and knelt down at Jesus' feet.
\v 26 That woman wasn't Jewish. She came from the region of Phoenicia in the province of Syria, and she spoke Greek. She asked Jesus to drive the evil spirit out of her child.
\p
\v 27 But Jesus said to her, “You aren't Jewish, so if I help you, it would be like a person throwing his children's food to the dogs. Let them be fed first, until they're full.”
\p
\v 28 But the mother answered, “True, Sir. Let the Jewish children eat until they're full. But the dogs can usually eat the leftover food that the children don't eat.”
\p
\v 29 Then Jesus said, “Because you answered like that, you may go home, Ma'am. The evil spirit has already gone out of your child, now.”
\v 30 Then the mother went home and saw her daughter lying peacefully on her bed, because the evil spirit had already gone out of her.
\s Jesus heals a man who was deaf and couldn't talk well
\p
\v 31 After that, Jesus and His disciples left the region of Tyre. They walked through the city of Sidon and went to the region near Lake Galilee, which was called the Ten Cities.
\v 32 There were some people there who brought a man to Jesus. The man was deaf and couldn't talk well. They asked Jesus to lay His hands on the man so that he would be healed.
\p
\v 33 Then Jesus invited just that man to go away from the crowd with Him. Then He put His fingers into both of the man's ears. After that, He spit on His own hand and then rubbed the spit onto the man's tongue.
\v 34 Then Jesus looked toward the sky, and He took a deep breath, as if He was preparing Himself to do something difficult,\f + \fr 7:34 \fk breath...something difficult \ft translates one word in the Greek that means 'to let out a long breath',” or 'breathe hard with noise'. By breathing like that, Jesus showed that He was offended, or was facing something difficult (Mark 8:12), or the meaning of this verse could have been that He was doing something very miraculous.\f* then He said to the man's ears, “Ephphatha.” In the Hebrew language it meant “Open up.”
\v 35 At that very moment, the man could hear, his tongue immediately became well, and he was able to speak clearly.
\p
\v 36 Jesus forbid them to tell about this healing to anyone. But the more He forbid them, the more they were inspired to tell what He had done.
\v 37 Everyone who heard about it was really amazed and said, “Everything that Jesus does is really awesome. He can even heal a deaf mute person!”
