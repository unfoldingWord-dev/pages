\s Jesus is welcomed in Jerusalem like a king
\r (Mat. 21:1-11; Luke 19:28-40; John 12:12-19)
\p
\v 1 When Jesus and His disciples were almost to Jerusalem, they arrived at the villages of Bethphage and Bethany, below the Mount of Olives. Then Jesus told two of His disciples to walk ahead of them,
\v 2 and He said to them, “Go to the village that's up ahead, and as soon as you enter it, you'll see a young donkey that hasn't been ridden on yet, tied up near a house. Untie its rope and bring it here.
\v 3 And if someone asks, ‘Why're you taking that donkey?’ answer, ‘The Lord needs it. He'll return it soon.’”
\p
\v 4 Then the two disciples went and found the young donkey tied up near the door of a house on the road, so they untied its rope.
\v 5 Some people standing there asked, “Why are you untying that donkey?”
\v 6 So they answered just the way Jesus told them to, and the people let them take the donkey away.
\v 7 The donkey was brought to Jesus, and they covered the back of the donkey with their robes. Then Jesus got up and sat on it.
\v 8 The crowd who had gathered took off their robes and spread them on the road that Jesus was going to pass by on. There were also some who covered the road with leafy branches that they had cut down near the road.
\v 9 The people who walked in front of Jesus and also behind Him all shouted,
\q1 “Hosanna! Praise the Lord!\f + \fr 11:9 \fk Hosanna! Praise the Lord! \ft Literally, “Hosanna.” In the ancient Hebrew language, it meant, 'Lord save us!' or 'Praise the Lord!' But at the time of Jesus, the meaning had changed to become a praise to the king, that meant the same as the word 'dirgahayu' in the Indonesian language. (Or 'Long live the king!' in English.) In using the word ‘hosanna’, it is clear that the crowd was praising God because they accepted Jesus as the Messiah— which means the King of Salvation that had been promised.\f* May God bless our King who comes to represent the Lord.
\q1
\v 10 May God bless this descendant of King David, so that He rules us well. Praise the Most High God!”
\p
\v 11 When Jesus reached Jerusalem, He entered God's Temple and saw all that was happening there. Because it was almost night already, He and His twelve disciples went to the village of Bethany.
\s Jesus curses the fig tree that didn't bear fruit
\r (Mat. 21:18-19)
\p
\v 12 The next day, when they were walking back from Bethany to Jerusalem, Jesus felt hungry.
\v 13 From a distance He saw a fig tree that had many leaves on it. Then He went closer to see if the tree had any fruit, but there was obviously no fruit, just leaves of course, as it wasn't the season for figs yet.\f + \fr 11:13 \fk wasn't the season for figs yet \ft Of course, this story reminded the first readers that the Prophet Jeremiah had prophesied that God would allow His Temple to be destroyed by people who opposed Him. (Jer. 7:8-13). In spite of that prophesy, the Jewish people at the time of Jesus still felt safe, and thought the land of Israel wouldn't be attacked by people who opposed them as long as the offerings were still being held at God's Temple. So they felt that they could oppress the poor and God wouldn't punish them. They were like the tree which didn't produce good fruit.\f*
\v 14 Then Jesus said to the tree, “From now on, people won't ever eat your fruit again”, and His disciples heard Him say that.
\s Jesus drives out the people who made God's Temple a marketplace
\r (Mat. 21:12-17, Luke 19:45-48, John 2:13-22)
\p
\v 15 Upon arriving in Jerusalem, Jesus entered the courtyard of God's Temple and began to drive out the people who were selling there. He turned over the tables used by the money changers.\f + \fr 11:15 \fk money changers \ft At that time, the high king of Rome governed all of the Jewish regions and many other provinces. For that reason, the money they used daily was Roman money. And the chief priests had forbidden that Roman money be offered to God. So the people who came to God's Temple had to exchange their money for money that was permitted, so that they could offer their money to God. The money that was permitted was the money of Tyre. The chief priests were also in charge of everything that was sold in God's Temple, so they became rich from the profits of the things that were sold, and from the money changing.\f* And He also upset the benches used by the people who sold doves.
\v 16 He forbid people to bring things through the courtyard of God's Temple too, because it wasn't a road.
\v 17 And Jesus taught them like this, “You already know, of course, that in the Holy Bible God says,
\q ‘My Temple will be called a house of prayer for all people groups.’\x + Is. 56:7\x*
\m But you've changed it to become ‘a hiding place for thieves!’ ”\x + Jer. 7:11\x*
\p
\v 18 When the chief priests and the Law experts heard that Jesus had done this, they began to look for a way to destroy Him, but they were afraid of Jesus, because many people liked his teaching and were amazed at it.
\p
\v 19 When it was getting dark, Jesus and His disciples left the city.
\s Jesus teaches about the fig tree that He cursed
\r (Mat. 21:20-22)
\p
\v 20 The next morning, when Jesus and His disciples were walking and passed near the fig tree, they saw that the tree had died and had dried up to the roots.
\v 21 Then Peter remembered what had happened the day before and said, “Teacher, look! The tree that You cursed yesterday is already dry.”
\p
\v 22 Then Jesus answered him, “Believe in God completely.
\v 23 I'm telling you the truth: If each of you believes completely, you can also do miracles like this. For example, you can ask God, 'Let this mountain be moved into the sea.' But you must believe completely, and not doubt that God will definitely do what you ask.
\v 24 For that reason, I'm advising all of you that when you pray and ask for something, believe like this: ‘God has already given what I asked of Him’, then God will give it to you.
\v 25-26 When you ask for something in prayer, examine yourself to see if you're bitter at another person. Forgive that person, so that your Father who's in heaven will also forgive all of your wrongs.\f + \fr 11: 25-26 \fk Verse 26 \ft An ancient copy adds these words, “But if you don't forgive other people, your Father who's in heaven won't forgive your wrongs either. In the Greek language, the word that's translated as, ‘maafkanlah’, is the same word that's translated as, ‘mengampuni’. In English there is just one word too, 'forgive'. The difference in translation occurs because in the Indonesian language, man can't possibly 'mengampuni' his fellowman's sins. In the Indonesian language, only God is able to 'mengampuni' sins.”\f*
\p
\s Jesus is asked who gave Him the right to teach and change traditions
\r (Mat. 21:23-27; Luke 20:1-8)
\p
\v 27 When Jesus and His disciples had returned to Jerusalem, and He was walking around in the courtyard of God's Temple, the chief priests, the Law experts and Jewish leaders came to Him.
\v 28 Then they asked, “Who gave you the right to teach and change our traditions— like what you did yesterday?! In whose name did you do that?”
\p
\v 29 Then Jesus said to them, "I want to ask you something too, and if you answer Me, then I'll tell you Who gave Me that right.
\v 30 Please answer this question of Mine: Who gave John the Baptist the right to baptize people? Did God\f + \fr 11:30 \fk God \ft Here and in verse 31, literally, “from heaven.”\f* give it to him, or did he do it of his own will?\f + \fr 11:30 \fk of his own will \ft In this verse and verse 32, literally, “from man.”\f*
\p
\v 31 Then they said to each other, “If we answer ‘God is the one who gave it to him,’ we will be defeated in the sight of this crowd when he says, ‘If so, why didn't you believe in John?’
\v 32-33 But it wouldn't be good for us to answer, ‘He did it of his own will’ either, because then this crowd will get angry at us!” So in the end they answered, “We don't know.” They answered like that because they were afraid of the crowd, because everyone who was gathered there believed that John was a prophet.
\p Then Jesus said to them, “If so, I won't tell you Who gave Me the right to do the things that I did yesterday either.”
