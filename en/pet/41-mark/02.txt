\s Jesus heals a paralyzed man
\r (Mat. 9:1-8, Luke 5:17-26)
\p
\v 1 After several days, Jesus returned to the city of Capernaum. So the news that Jesus had returned spread quickly in the city.
\v 2 Then many people came and gathered to hear Him teach the Lord's Word. The house became so full that there wasn't even room to stand in front of the door.
\v 3 Meanwhile, four men came to Him carrying a paralyzed man on a mattress.
\v 4 But because there were too many people, they weren't able to carry him directly to Jesus. So they carried him on the mattress up to the roof of the house, and opened it up at the exact place where Jesus was. Then they let the paralyzed man down on the mattress, in front of Jesus.
\v 5 When Jesus saw them do that, He knew that the men firmly believed that He had power to heal the paralyzed man. So Jesus said to the paralyzed man, “Young man, I have forgiven your sins.”
\p
\v 6 But there were some Law experts sitting there. When they heard Jesus say that, they found fault with Him, thinking,
\v 7 “This man is too daring to speak like that! He has insulted God! No one can forgive the sins of man, except God Himself.”
\p
\v 8 At that very moment, Jesus knew what they were thinking, so he rebuked them, saying, “I know that you doubt in your hearts what I said!
\v 9 Certainly you will have difficulty accepting that I said to this paralyzed man, ‘I've forgiven your sins.’ Will it be easier for you to accept it if I say to him, ‘Get up, pick up your mattress and go home’?
\v 10 But with these words I'm proving to you that I, as the Son of Man,\f + \fr 2:10 \fk Son of Man \ft When Jesus lived on this earth, He often called Himself “Son of Man.” But the meaning of this term isn't directed at the word 'son'. In Hebrew, 'son of man' means 'normal human being'. Jesus called Himself that to remind His listeners about what the Prophet Daniel had witnessed in a vision of the King of Salvation. (Dan. 7:13-14) For Daniel saw Jesus in heaven in the form of a 'son of man'— meaning in the form of a 'normal human being', when God appointed Him King over everything. In this translation, 'who I am' is often added so that it's obvious that Jesus is speaking about Himself.\f* have the right to forgive people's sins!” Then Jesus said to the paralyzed man,
\v 11 “Get up, pick up your mattress and go home!”
\v 12 At that very moment, the paralyzed man got up, picked up his mattress, and went out of that house. Everyone who saw that was very amazed, and they praised God saying, “We've never seen a miracle like this!”
\s Jesus calls Matthew
\r (Mat. 9:9-13, Luke 5:27-32)
\p
\v 13 When Jesus returned again to the shore of Lake Galilee, many people came to Him, so He taught them.
\v 14 After teaching, while Jesus was walking away from that place, He saw a government official who was sitting in his office. That man's job was to collect taxes\f + \fr 2:14 \fk collect taxes \ft In Jesus’ time, Israel was colonized by the kingdom of Rome. So if a Jew became a tax collector, he was considered to be a person who had betrayed his own people. For that reason, tax collectors were considered sinners by all other Jews. They were also hated because they liked to collect more taxes than the actual amount. (Luke 3:12-13) Because of that, the tax collectors became rich.\f* from the people to give to the Roman government. His name was Matthew,\f + \fr 2:14 \fk Matthew \ft Mark wrote Matthew's other name— which is “Levi.” Today we know him better as Matthew— as it is written in Mat. 9:9-13, 10:3.\f* and he was the son of Alphaeus. Jesus approached him and said, “Come and follow Me!” At that very moment, Matthew got up and followed Jesus on the trip.
\p
\v 15 Then Jesus and His disciples ate supper at Matthew's house. Matthew's co-workers, and other people, who were also considered to be sinners,\f + \fr 2:15 \fk also considered to be sinners \ft All tax collectors were considered to be sinners. See the footnote for verse 14.\f* were eating there. At that time, many other people who weren't considered to be good often followed Jesus.
\v 16 There were some Law experts there at the time, who were also members of the religious group called the Pharisees.\f + \fr 2:16 \fk the religious group called the Pharisees \ft a group of Jews who maintained that all of Moses' rules, and those added by the Jewish forefathers, had to be strictly followed. For that reason, many of them bragged like this, “We're the ones who're very pleasing in God's sight.” Many of them didn't like Jesus either, because He didn't join their group, and they were jealous because many people followed Him. Jesus rebuked the Pharisee group along with the Law experts in Mat. 23, because they just pretended to be good people.\f* They came and saw that Jesus and His disciples were eating with people who were considered to be sinners. So they said to His disciples, “Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and other sinners?”
\p
\v 17 When Jesus heard their words, He said to them, “A healthy person doesn't need to go to a doctor. The one who needs to go to a doctor is the sick person. It's the same with Me. I came to call sinful people to repent— not people who feel they're righteous!”
\s Jesus answers a question about why His disciples don't fast
\r (Mat. 9:14-17, Luke 5:33-39)
\p
\v 18 On another day, John the Baptist's disciples were fasting, as was the tradition of the Jewish forefathers. So were the members of the Pharisee group. Then some people came to Jesus and asked, “Why do other religious groups fast, but Your disciples don't?”
\p
\v 19 Jesus answered by giving an example that shows a similarity, “It would never happen that the guests at a wedding feast would be ordered to fast as long as the groom was still with them! So as long as I'm with My disciples, they won't fast either.
\v 20 But think about what will happen if the groom is killed by his enemies. That's what will happen to Me, and at that time My disciples will fast, as a sign of mourning.”
\p
\v 21 Then Jesus gave them two more examples: “If a person has an old tunic that's already torn, he can't patch the tunic with new cloth, because if the tunic is washed, the new cloth patch will shrink, and it'll make the torn part tear even more.
\p
\v 22 It's like that with new wine too.\f + \fr 2:22 \fk new wine \ft New grapes were pressed, then the grape juice was called new wine and tasted sweet. New wine that was kept for a certain time would undergo the process of fermentation. The longer it was stored, the higher the alcohol content became. In Bible times, what was called 'new wine' might contain some alcohol, but not as high of a content as old wine.\f* That wine can't be put into an old leather bag, because when the wine produces gas and the gas can't get out, the bag will break. In the end, the wine will spill out and the leather bag will just be thrown away. For that reason, new wine must be put into a new leather bag.”\f + \fr 2:22 \fk the old and the new \ft In these two examples, Jesus compared something old to something new. This teaching was given when He was asked about the Jewish forefathers tradition of fasting. Obviously, like new cloth and new wine, Jesus' teaching couldn't be combined with the old teaching of the forefathers. The same thing is seen in the story that follows.\f*
\s Jesus is Lord over the Sabbath
\r (Mat. 12:1-8; Luke 6:1-5)
\p
\v 23 On the Sabbath Day, Jesus and His disciples were walking through a large wheat field. Because they were hungry, His disciples picked some stalks of wheat and ate the grains.
\v 24 At the time, some Pharisees saw them and said to Jesus, “Why did Your disciples do that?! They're breaking the rules of the Sabbath Day.”
\p
\v 25 Then Jesus answered them, “You already know the story about David, of course, when he and the men who were with him experienced trouble and were hungry.
\v 26 David went into the Lord's Tabernacle to ask for bread from Abiathar— who was serving as high priest at the time. The bread that was given to David was the bread that was always put in the Holy Place in the Lord's Tabernacle. And according to the rules of Moses, that bread could only be eaten by the priests.\x + Lev. 24:9, 1 Sam. 21:1-6\x* But because they needed it, no one considers what David did to be sin.”
\p
\v 27 Then Jesus spoke to the Pharisees again, “The Lord created the Sabbath Day to help people— not to make men slaves of the Sabbath Day!
\v 28 In the same way, I as the Son of Man, am the Lord who has authority to determine everything, including what may or may not be done on the Sabbath Day.”
