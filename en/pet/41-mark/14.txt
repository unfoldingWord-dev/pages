\s The Jewish leaders look for a way to kill Jesus
\p
\v 1 Two days before the Passover Day,\f + \fr 14:1 \fk Passover Day \ft Literally, “Passover and the Celebration of Bread Without Yeast,” which translates just one word in the Greek language. The 'Celebration of Bread Without Yeast' began on Passover Day and continued for eight days— including two Sabbath Days. The two holidays were celebrated together. See Ex. 12; Luke 22:1.\f* without the crowd knowing it, members of the chief priests and the Law experts began to look for a way to arrest Jesus so that they could kill Him.
\v 2 Then they said, “We can't arrest him while the feast is going on. Then the crowd would get angry at us and there could be a riot."
\s A woman pours fragrant oil on Jesus' head
\r (Mat. 26:6-13; John 12:1-8)
\p
\v 3 After that, Jesus and His disciples went to Bethany. They ate at the house of Simon, who was also called The Leper.\f + \fr 14:3 \fk The Leper \ft Many commentators say it's very likely that this Simon had been healed of his disease before this time. See the footnote in Mark 1:40.\f* While Jesus and some other people were eating, a woman entered bringing some expensive fragrant oil. The oil was made of pure nard, and was in a bottle made of white stone. The bottle was intentionally made without a stopper. So the woman approached Jesus and broke the neck of the bottle, then poured the oil on Jesus' head.
\p
\v 4 But when some people saw that, they were angry and said to each other, “Why was that oil just wasted?!
\v 5 If we sold that oil, we would get a lot of money, for sure,\f + \fr 14:5 \fk a lot of money \ft Literally, “300 denarii.” In Roman times, the denarius was a coin made of pure silver. Its value was the same as a worker's wage for a full day. So 300 denarii was almost the same as the wages of a worker for one year.\f* then we could distribute that money to poor people.”
\p
\v 6 But Jesus said to them, “Just let her alone! Don't rebuke her. For this woman has done a good deed for Me.
\v 7 For poor people will always be around you, and you can help them any time. But I won't always be with you.
\v 8 And actually, by pouring the fragrant oil on My head, she has prepared My body to be buried.\f + \fr 14:8 \fk prepared My body to be buried \ft The Jews usually put fragrant oil and spices on the bodies of dead people before burial (like in Mark 16:1). But this woman— Mary, probably didn't know that Jesus was going to die. She poured fragrant oil on Jesus' head because she loved Him and may have wanted to honor Him and give Him thanks— especially because Jesus had raised up her brother Lazarus from the dead (John 11:38-44; 12:1-8).\f* This was all that she could do for Me.
\v 9 I'm telling you the truth: “When the Good News about Me is spread throughout the whole world, what this woman did to Me will continue to be told, so that she'll never be forgotten.”
\s Judas sells Jesus
\r (Mat. 26:14-16, Luke 22:3-6)
\p
\v 10 Then Judas, from the village of Cariot—\f + \fr 14:10 \fk Judas, from the village of Cariot \ft Literally, “Judas Iscariot.” In the Hebrew language, 'Iscariot' means 'a person from Cariot'.\f* one of His twelve disciples, went to the chief priests to tell them that he was ready to sell Jesus to them.
\v 11 When they heard that, they were really glad, and promised to give him money. Then Judas began to look for an opportunity to hand Jesus over to them.
\s Jesus eats the Passover meal with His twelve disciples
\r (Mat. 26:17-25, Luke 22:7-14, 21-23, John 13:21-30)
\p
\v 12 The first day of the Passover celebration came—\f + \fr 14:12 \fk Passover \ft Literally, “Celebration of Bread Without Yeast.” See the footnote in Mark 12:1\f* which was the day when all the Passover lambs were killed. Then Jesus' disciples asked Him, “Teacher, where will we eat the Passover meal— so we can go there to prepare it?”
\p
\v 13 Then Jesus told two of His disciples, “The two of you go into Jerusalem. You'll meet a male servant carrying a container of water. Follow him.
\v 14 When he enters a house, go in with him and say to the owner of the house, 'Our Teacher wants to ask you: Where is there a place for Him and we His disciples, to eat the Passover meal?’
\v 15 Then that person will show you a large room upstairs which is eqipped with a table and everything that's needed. Prepare the Passover food for us there.”
\v 16 Then the two disciples went to Jerusalem, and they found it exactly as Jesus had told them. So they prepared the Passover meal there.
\p
\v 17 That evening Jesus came with His disciples.
\v 18 While they were eating, He said to them, “I'm telling you the truth: One of you will hand Me over to those who oopose Me. That person is eating with us.”
\p
\v 19 When they heard that, they became really sad, and one by one began to say to Him, “Lord, that certainly isn't me!”
\p
\v 20 Then Jesus said again, “One of you twelve men will hand Me over to be arrested. He will soon dip his bread into the same plate with Me, as if he was still My close friend.\f + \fr 14:20 \fk as if he was still My close friend \ft Eating from a plate or a bowl of food together was a sign of a close friendship. Here Jesus and His disciples dipped their bread and bitter vegetables into the same large bowl. Ps. 41:9 apparently prophesies about what Judas did.\f*
\v 21 For just as it's written in the Holy Bible, the Son of Man—\f + \fr 14:21 \fk Son of Man \ft See the foot note in Mat. 9:6.\f* who I am, has been appointed to be killed, of course. But what a pity for the one who hands Me over to My enemies! He'll get such harsh punishment, that he'll think it would be better if he hadn't ever been born.”
\s Jesus gives food that becomes a reminder of His body and blood
\r (Mat. 26:26-30, Luke 22:15-20, 1 Cor. 11:23-25)
\p
\v 22 While they were eating, Jesus took bread and gave thanks to God for the bread. Then He tore the bread, and when he gave the bread so that each of them could eat it He said, “Take this bread and eat it. This is My body.
\p
\v 23-24 After that, Jesus took a cup that was filled with wine, then He gave thanks to God. When He gave it, so that each of them drank from the cup, He said, “This is my blood— which will be poured out for many people. The blood of My death is the sign that a new promise between God and man is now official.” Then they all drank.
\v 25 And Jesus said again. “I'm telling you the truth: I won't drink wine like this until the kingdom that God promised is obvious. At that time, I'll drink new wine.”
\p
\v 26 Then they sang a praise song to God, and after that they went to the Mount of Olives.
\s Peter will deny Jesus is his teacher
\r (Mat. 26:31-35, Luke 22:31-34, John 13:36-38)
\p
\v 27 While they were walking, Jesus said to His disciples, “Tonight you'll all run away and leave Me, because God has determined that what will happen to Me is according to what's written in the Holy Bible,
\q ‘I'll strike and kill the Shepherd.
\q At that time His sheep will run here and there.’\x + Zech. 13:7\x*
\m
\v 28 But after God raises Me up again from death, I'll first go to the region of Galilee.”
\p
\v 29 Then Peter said, “Even if all the other friends run away and leave You, I won't!”
\p
\v 30 Then Jesus said to him, “I'm telling you the truth: Tonight, before the rooster crows twice, you'll deny that I'm your teacher three times.’”
\p
\v 31 But Peter answered again emphatically, “If I really have to die with You, I'm ready, because I won't say that I don't know You!” And all the other disciples said the same thing.
\s Jesus prays alone in the garden of Gethsemane
\r (Mat. 26:36-46, Luke 22:39-46)
\p
\v 32 After Jesus and His disciples arrived at the garden called Gethsemane, He said to them, “Sit here, because I want to go pray.”
\v 33 Then He invited Peter, James and John to follow Him. At that time, Jesus felt very sad and His heart was very distressed.
\v 34 Then He said to them, “My heart is so sad that it feels like it's dying. Stay here. Keep watching while praying.”
\p
\v 35 Then Jesus went a little farther away from them, and knelt, and He knelt down and prayed that if God was willing— He would be released from the trouble that was coming soon.
\v 36 He prayed like this, “Abba,\f + \fr 14:36 \fk Abba \ft Abba isn't the Greek language, but it was the everyday Hebrew language at that time, and that word was used by little children who don't say 'father' yet, but 'daddy'. So when Jesus called his Father 'Abba', it showed compassion and the very closest relationship.\f* Father, You're able to do anything. Please release Me from this trouble! But I'm not asking that My will be done, but may Your will alone be done, Father.”
\p
\v 37 After praying, He returned to His three disciples, and He they had fallen asleep. Then He said to Peter, “Simon, are you sleeping? You obviously can't keep watching while praying for just one hour!”
\v 38 Then Jesus said again, “Stay alert while praying so that you none of you will fall into sin when the devil tempts you. Your spirit wants to do what's good, of course, but you're physically weak.”
\p
\v 39 Then Jesus returned to the same place to pray, and He prayed for the same thing.
\v 40 When He finished praying, He returned and found they had fallen asleep again, because they were too sleepy. When He rebuked them, they were just silent. They were so ashamed and couldn't find a reason that made sense to give to Him.
\p
\v 41 After that Jesus went again to pray for the third time, and when He returned to them, He said, “You're still sleeping and resting— huh! That's enough! The time has come. Look! I— the Son of Man, will be handed over to the hands of sinners.
\v 42 Get up! Let's go now. Look! The one who's handing Me over to My enemies has already come.”
\s Jesus is arrested
\r (Mat. 26:47-53, Luke 22:47-53, John 18:3-12)
\p
\v 43 While Jesus was still speaking, suddenly Judas— who was one of His twelve disciples, came with a crowd. They were carrying swords and wooden clubs. These were the people sent by the chief priests, Law experts, and Jewish leaders.
\v 44 Judas had told them ahead of time, “The person I hug is Jesus. Arrest him, and guard him well.”
\v 45 When Judas arrived, he immediately approached Jesus and said, “Teacher.” Then he hugged Jesus.\f + \fr 14:44-45 \fk hugged Jesus \ft Literally, “kissed.” This was the natural way for Jews to greet each other.\f*
\p
\v 46 And those people immediately arrested Jesus.
\v 47 But one of Jesus' disciples drew his sword and attacked the high priest's slave. However he only succeeded in cutting off his ear.
\p
\v 48 Then Jesus said to them, “Do you think I'm a criminal— huh, so that you have to bring swords and wooden clubs here?!
\v 49 However, I've been with you everyday in the courtyard of God's Temple giving My teaching! So why didn't you arrest Me there? But this was appointed to happen to Me according to what was written in the Holy Bible.”
\p
\v 50 At that time, all of His disciples ran away and left Him.
\p
\v 51 A young man\f + \fr 14:51 \fk young man \ft Many commentators think that most likely this young man was Mark himself. He was a resident of Jerusalem (Acts 12:12).\f* tried to follow Jesus from behind. He was wearing just a fine linen cloth, and they almost caught him by grabbing that cloth.
\v 52 So he left the cloth in their hands and ran away naked.
\s Jesus is brought before the council of the Jewish Religious Court
\r (Mat. 26:57-68, Luke 22:54-55, 63-71, John 18:13-14, 19-24)
\p
\v 53 After that, they brought Jesus to the high priest's house. The whole Jewish Religious Court council was gathering there—that is the chief priests, Jewish leaders, and Law experts.
\v 54 But Peter followed Jesus from a distance, up to the yard of the high priest's house. He sat there with the high priest's guards, warming himself near a fire, along with them.
\p
\v 55-56 At that time, the chief priests and all the members of the Religious Court council were looking for a way to prove that Jesus was guilty, so they could give Him the death sentence. Some men had secretly been bribed so that they would give false testimonies about Jesus. But even though many people gave false testimonies, the testimonies of even just two of them weren't the same. For that reason, they didn't succeed in proving any fault in Jesus at all.
\p
\v 57 Then some people stood up and gave a false testimony against Him,
\v 58 “We heard Him say, ‘I'll demolish God's Temple that was made by human hands, and in three days time I'll rebuild a new one, that isn't made by human hands.’”
\v 59 But the testimonies of just two of them about that claim weren't even the same.
\p
\v 60 Then the high priest stood in front of them and said to Jesus, “Why don't you answer anything, even though many people have already testified about your false teachings?!”
\v 61 But Jesus just kept silent and didn't answer anything.
\p Then the high priest asked Him again, “Are you the Son of God, and the Christ?”\f + \fr 14:61 \fk the Son of God, and the Christ \ft According to Jewish tradition, the high priest avoided saying 'God'. He literally said “The Son of the Praised One.” In the following verse, Jesus also followed that tradition by not directly saying 'God', but “the Almighty.” And that tradition also appears in Mark 11:30. See the note in Mark 1:1 regarding the meaning of "Christ".\f*
\p
\v 62 And Jesus answered, “Yes, that's true. And you'll see the Son of Man,\f + \fr 14:62 \fk Son of Man \ft See the footnote in Mark 2:10. What Jesus said about Himself is quoted from Ps. 110:1 and Dan. 7:13.\f*— who I am, sitting in the most honored place at the right side of The Almighty. And when I come from heaven too, you'll see Me coming in the clouds.”
\p
\v 63 When he heard that, the high priest tore the thin tunic\f + \fr 14:63 \fk tore the thin tunic \ft In Jewish culture, tearing one's tunic was a sign of being very sad or strongly disagreeing. Mark used a word in the Greek language which shows that the garment torn was a fine inner garment— not the robe, the thick outer garment. (Gen. 37:34, Josh. 7:6, 2 Sam. 1:11, 2 Kings 18:37, 19:1)\f* he was wearing to show his anger, and said, “Why do we need to look for any more witnesses?!
\v 64 You heard for yourselves that he insulted God! So what's your opinion?”
\p Then they all decided to give Him the death sentence.
\p
\v 65 After that, there were some of them who began to spit on Him. They also covered His eyes with a piece of cloth, and while hitting Him they said, “If you're a prophet, try to guess the name of the person who just hit you!” Then the high priest's guards also beat Jesus and took Him outside.
\s Peter denies that he's a follower of Jesus
\r (Mat. 26:69-75, Luke 22:56-62, John 18:25-27)
\p
\v 66 While all that was happening, Peter was still warming himself near the fire in the high priest's yard. Then a female servant of the high priest came.
\v 67 When she noticed Peter's face in the light of the fire, she said to him, “You're one of the followers of Jesus of Nazareth too— right?!”
\p
\v 68 But Peter said, “I don't know, and I don't understand what you're saying either.” Then he went to the entry gate, and at that very moment a rooster crowed.
\p
\v 69 When the female servant saw Peter again, she began to say to the people who were there, “This man is one of those who follow Jesus too.”
\v 70 But Peter denied it again, “Not me.”
\p Not long after that, the people who were standing there said to Peter, “It's true! You're one of them too, because you're a Galilean too.”
\p
\v 71 Then Peter began to swear, “By the Lord, I don't know that man!”
\p
\v 72 At that time, a rooster crowed a second time. Then Peter remembered what Jesus had said to him that night, “Before the rooster crows twice, you'll have denied three times that I'm your teacher.” Peter immediately wept with great sadness.
