\s Jesus is rejected in His hometown

\p

\v 1 Then Jesus left the town of Capernaum and returned to Nazareth, His hometown. His disciples also went with Him.

\v 2 On the Sabbath Day, Jesus began teaching in their synagogue. Many people were very amazed when they heard Him teach, so they said to each other, “Why does he think he can teach us?! Has he learned from someone else? Who has given him the power to do many miracles?

\v 3 He's just that carpenter we know— the son of Mary, and the older brother of James, Joseph, Judas and Simon! And his younger sisters also live here with us.” They didn't want to believe in Him because they already knew who He was.
\p
\v 4 Then Jesus said to them, “A prophet is always honored everywhere, except where he came from, among his brothers and sisters and family.”
\v 5 Because they didn't believe in Him, Jesus didn't do many miracles there. He just laid His hands on a few sick people and healed them.
\v 6 Jesus was really amazed, because the people in His own village didn't really believe in Him.
\s Jesus sends out His disciples
\r (Matt. 10:1, 5-15; Luke 9:1-6)
\p So Jesus went walking from one village to another, to teach throughout that region.
\v 7 Then Jesus called His twelve disciples to come because He wanted to send them out. He divided them into six groups— each group had two people. Then He gave them authority to drive out evil spirits.
\v 8 He also instructed them, “Don't take anything on the trip— including food, bag, or even money. You can only take a walking stick.\f + \fr 6:8 \fk walking stick \ft A walking stick was used to walk across rocky hills. It was also used as a weapon against wild animals and criminals.\f*
\v 9 You may wear sandals, and just the clothes on your back. Don't take a change of clothes.
\p
\v 10 “When you enter a village and a family takes you into their house to stay overnight, stay in that house only, until you leave that village.
\v 11 But if you go to another village, and the people there don't want to accept you and don't want to hear what you teach, leave that village. And when you leave, remove the dirt of the city from your feet and sandals, as a sign of warning to them.”\f + \fr 6:11 \fk remove the dirt ..... sign of warning \ft Literally, “kick off the dust.” At that time, it had become the Jewish custom that if they were forced to travel through a non-Jewish region, they cleaned the soles of their feet and their clothes when they left that region. That was done because they considered non-Jews and their land to be ritually unclean and dirty. Jesus ordered His disciples to do the same thing to the Jews who rejected God's teaching. In that way, His disciples showed that in God's eyes, stubborn people like that were considered to be ritually unclean. It also became a sign that God would punish them if they didn't repent. See another example of this in Acts 18:6.\f*
\p
\v 12 Then His disciples went and told that it was already time to repent.
\v 13 They also drove many demons out of people. And when they rubbed olive oil\f + \fr 6:13 \fk rubbed oil... God's blessing \ft Jesus' disciples anointed a only a certain part of the body— maybe part of the head, not the whole body. The disciples didn't massage a person, and what was used was olive oil— not rubbing oil. The disciples knew that God healed the person— not the oil. The oil was used to symbolize and remind that God was present and working. See also James 5:14-15 and the footnote for verse 14.\f* on sick people as a sign of God's blessing, those sick people became well.
\s Herod hears about Jesus
\r (Matt. 14:1-12; Luke 9:7-9)
\p
\v 14 Then King Herod— the king of the province of Galilee, heard about Jesus, because His name was already well-known everywhere. By the time that happened, Herod had just murdered John the Baptist.\f + \fr 6:14 \fk just murdered John the Baptist \ft This information— which Mark tells about in verses 17-28, was already known by the original readers. It's expressed here to help modern day readers understand verses 14-16.\f* So there were people who said, “John the Baptist has come back to life, but now he calls himself Jesus,\f + \fr 6:14 \fk calls himself Jesus \ft Soon after John was killed, Jesus' name suddenly became well known as a man who performed many miracles. So some people, who had never seen or known Jesus, thought that maybe John had come back from heaven directly, and was calling himself by a new name. At the time of Jesus, there were many others named Jesus. Jesus' name in Greek is the same as the name Joshua in Hebrew. The two names mean “God My Savior.”\f* and that's why he can do many miracles.”
\v 15 But there were other people who said, “He's the Prophet Elijah— who was taken up alive to heaven long ago, and now he has come back and calls himself Jesus.” But there were also those who said, “He's a new prophet, like the prophets that lived in times past.”
\p
\v 16 When Herod heard that, he said, “He's John the Baptist for sure, whom I had ordered my soldier to behead, and now he has come back to life.”
\s How John the Baptist was killed
\r (Matt. 14:3-12)
\p
\v 17-18 Long before that event, Herod had taken off with Herodiana,\f + \fr 6:17 \fk Herodiana \ft This name is often written in Indonesian translations as “Herodias.” The spelling Herodiana was chosen so that it's obvious that this is a woman's name.\f* the wife of his own younger brother, Philip. John the Baptist had rebuked him over and over again, “According to the Law you can't marry your younger brother's wife. ”\f + \fr 6:17 \fk Law … younger brother's wife \ft God had forbidden a man to marry or have sex with his brother's wife, (Lev. 18:16; 20:21), unless that brother had died and didn't have children. Then his brother could marry the widow in order to have descendants, and the children born in their marriage would be considered to be children of the brother who had died. (Deut. 25:5–6; Mark 12:18-27).\f* For that reason Herod ordered his soldiers to arrest John, and put him in prison, bound with iron chains.
\v 19 For that reason too, Herodiana had a grudge against John the Baptist, and tried to arrange plans to kill him. But she couldn't do it,
\v because King Herod didn't give her permission, since he was afraid of John the Baptist. Herod was aware that John was a holy and righteous man in God's eyes, and he also enjoyed hearing John's teaching, even though it always made him feel anxious.
\p
\v 21 Finally, Herodiana got the opportunity she wanted when they celebrated Herod's birthday. Herod invited high officials, the head of the army, and also people who were important in Galilee, to that dinner party.
\v 22 At the party, Herodiana's daughter danced in front of Herod and all of his guests. They were all very pleased to watch her dance, so Herod immediately promised her, “You may ask whatever you wish, and I'll give it to you.”
\v 23 Herod also swore like this, “I'll give you whatever you ask, even if it's half the power I have over this kingdom.”
\p
\v 24 So the girl went out and asked her mother, “What should I ask for?”
\p And her mother said, “Ask for the head of John the Baptist.”
\p
\v 25 The girl returned quickly to King Herod and said, “I'm asking for John the Baptist's head to be cut off, put on a large plate and brought here right now!"
\p
\v 26 When Herod heard that request he really regrettedit, but he couldn't deny the girl's request, because he'd already taken a vow in front of all of his guests.
\v 27 So Herod immediately ordered a soldier to go and cut off and bring John's head. The soldier who was ordered to do that was the one who was always assigned to kill people who were sentenced to death. So he went to the prison and cut John's neck,
\v 28 and brought his head on a large plate, then gave it to the girl. And the girl gave it to her mother.
\v 29 When John's followers heard that news, they went to the prison to get his body and bury it.
\s Jesus feeds more than five thousand people
\r (Matt. 14:13-21; Luke 9:10-17; John 6:1-14)
\p
\v 30 When the disciples, whom Jesus sent out, returned and got together with Him, they told Him everything that they had done and taught.
\v 31 But at the time, people kept coming to that place, so Jesus and His disciples had no time at all to rest— not even to eat. So Jesus said to them, “Let's go to a quiet place, so that we can rest there.”
\p
\v 32 Then they got into a boat and went to a quiet place.
\v 33 But there were many people who saw Jesus and His disciples get into a boat, and without being told, they guessed where they were going. So those people went on foot, following them. There were other people from the cities of that region who heard and ran to join them too. So those peopla arrived at the place before Jesus and His disciples did.
\v 34 When Jesus got out of the boat, He saw how many people had already gathered there, and He felt compassion for them, because they were like sheep who didn't have a shepherd. Then He began to teach them many things.
\p
\v 35 When it was getting dark, His disciples came and said to Him, “It's already getting dark now, and this is a remote region,
\v 36 so it would be best if we order them to go to nearby houses and villages to buy food.”
\p
\v 37 But Jesus said to His disciples, “You be the ones to feed them!”
\p But the twelve disciples replied, “It's impossible for us to buy food for this many people! If we worked for a month, we could possibly get enough money,\f + \fr 6:37 \fk worked for a month... enough money \ft translates “200 denarii.” During Roman times, a denarius was a coin made of real silver. At that time, one denarius was a worker's wage for a day, so 200 denarii was a fairly large sum of money, the same as the wages of 200 people for a day, or of 12 people working for a month.\f* and then buy food for them.”
\v 38 Then Jesus asked, “How many pieces of bread do you have? Go and see.”
\p After looking, they answered, “There are five pieces of bread and two fish.”
\p
\v 39 Then Jesus ordered the crowd to sit in groups on the grass.
\v 40 So the crowd sat down in many groups. Each group had fifty people, and some even had a hundred people.
\p
\v 41 Then Jesus took the five pieces of bread and two fish, looked up to the sky, and gave thanks to God for the food. So he tore up the bread and shredded the fish, then He gave it over and over again to His disciples, while they distributed it to the crowd.
\v 42 After the crowd had eaten until they were satisfied,
\v 43 His disciples gathered up as many as twelve baskets of leftover bread and fish.
\v 44 The total number of those who ate was five thousand men, not yet including women and children.
\s Jesus walks on water
\r (Matt. 14:22-32; John 6:15-21)
\p
\v 45 After that, Jesus immediately ordered His disciples to get into the boat and go ahead of Him to the village of Bethsaida, on the other side of the lake, while He ordered the crowd to go home.
\v 46 After that, Jesus went alone to a hill to pray.
\p
\v 47 When it was night, the disciples who were in the boat were already in the middle of the lake, while Jesus was still on land.
\v 48 He saw that they were having trouble rowing the boat against a strong wind. Then about one hour before morning, He came to them, walking on the water, and He seemed to be walking past them on purpose.
\v 49-50 When they saw Jesus walking on top of the water, they were afraid and cried out because they thought He was a ghost.
\p But he said to them, “Take courage! It's Me. Don't be afraid!”
\v 51 When Jesus got into the boat, the wind stopped immediately. And they were really amazed.
\v 52 They didn't yet understand about the miracle that Jesus did either, when He fed five thousand people with just five pieces of bread and two fish. It was hard for them to understand, because their hearts and minds hadn't yet been opened by God.
\s Jesus heals many sick people in Gennesaret
\p
\v 53-54 After Jesus and His disciples arrived in the village of Gennesaret, when they got out and tied up the boat, the people there knew immediately that He was Jesus.
\v 55 Then the people ran to every region there to tell that Jesus had come back. So they brought sick people on their mattresses to the places where they heard Jesus was.
\v 56 So if Jesus was in a city, or in a village, or in a house outside of a village, they brought sick people to the nearest public place, and they asked that He permit the sick people simply to touch the edge of His robe. And everyone who touched Him was healed.
