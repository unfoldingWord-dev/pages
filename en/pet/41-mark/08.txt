\s Jesus feeds more than four thousand people
\r (Mat. 15:32-39)
\p
\v 1 On another day, many people came back and gathered around Jesus. They didn't have any food, so Jesus called His disciples and said,
\v 2 “I feel very compassionate for this crowd, because they've already been with Me for three days, and now they don't have any more food.
\v 3 If I order them to go home hungry, they may faint on the road, because some came from far away.”
\p
\v 4 But His disciples answered, “What! Why do You say that, Sir?! It isn't possible for us to feed this many people in a desert place like this!”
\p
\v 5 Then Jesus asked them, “How much bread do you have?”
\p They answered, “Only seven pieces.”
\p
\v 6 Jesus ordered the crowd to sit on the ground. He took the seven pieces of bread and gave thanks to God. Then He tore the bread and gave it to His disciples over and over again, and they distributed it to the crowd.
\v 7 They also had a few small fish. So Jesus gave thanks to God for the fish, and then ordered His disciples to distribute them.
\v 8 The crowd ate until they were satisfied. After that, they gathered all of the leftover food, and seven large full baskets were leftover.
\v 9 There were about four thousand people who ate. After that Jesus ordered them to go home.
\v 10 Then Jesus and His disciples immediately got into a boat and went to the region of Dalmanutha.
\s The Pharisee religious group orders Jesus to do a miracle
\r (Mat. 16:1-4)
\p
\v 11 Then the Pharisees came and began to debate with Jesus. They were actually looking for a reason to accuse Him. Because of that, they ordered Him to do a miracle in order to prove that God had sent Him.
\p
\v 12 When Jesus heard that, He felt offended\f + \fr 8:12 \fk offended \ft translates one word which means 'to let out a long breath', or 'breathe hard with noise'. By breathing like that, Jesus showed that He was offended, or was facing something difficult.\f* in His heart, and said, “It isn't proper for hard-headed people\f + \fr 8:12 \fk hard-headed people... \ft translates 'this generation' or 'people of this age'. This word shows that Jesus was offended because they had already witnessed many other miracles, but they still didn't believe in Him.\f* like you to order Me to do a miracle! I won't do any miracle at all for people like you.”
\v 13 After saying that, Jesus left them and got into a boat with His disciples for the other side of the lake.
\s Jesus warns not to be affected by the yeast of the Pharisee group or of King Herod's friends
\r (Mat. 16:5-12)
\p
\v 14 At the time, Jesus' disciples had forgotten to bring food. They had only one piece of bread in the boat.
\v 15 Then Jesus told them, “Be careful, don't be affected by the yeast\f + \fr 8:15 \fk yeast \ft In a Jewish analogy, they compared yeast to sin, because when yeast was added to bread dough, the dough expanded. So they compared yeast to sin, which can expand and spread to other people. See 1 Cor. 5:6-8 and Gal. 5:9.\f* of the Pharisee group or of King Herod's friends.”
\p
\v 16 They didn't understand what Jesus was saying, so they said to each other, “He said that because we forgot to bring enough bread.”
\v 17 But Jesus already knew what they were saying. So He said to them, “Why're you talking about the lack of bread! You should already be able to understand! You're too hard-headed!”\f + \fr 8:17 \fk You should... \ft Two rhetorical questions are translated as statements. Literally, “Don't you know or understand yet? Have your hearts already become hardened?”\f*
\v 18 You have eyes and ears— don't you?! If so, why can't see or hear?! How could you forget what you witnessed for yourselves?!
\v 19 When I tore up the five pieces of bread to feed five thousand people, how many full baskets of leftover bread did you collect?”
\p Then they answered, “Twelve.”
\p
\v 20 “And when I tore up the seven pieces of bread to give to four thousand people, how many large full baskets of leftover bread did you collect?”
\p And they answered, “Seven full baskets.”
\p
\v 21 Then He said to them again, “Don't you understand yet?”\f + \fr 8:21 \fk Don't you understand yet? \ft Jesus' meaning in this verse is explained by Matthew. See Mat. 16:12.\f*
\s Jesus makes the blind man in Bethsaida able to see
\p
\v 22 When Jesus and His disciples arrived in the village of Bethsaida, there were some people who brought a blind man to Jesus. Then they really begged Jesus to touch the blind man so that he could see.
\v 23 So Jesus held the blind man's hand and led him outside the village. After that, Jesus rubbed His spit on the man's eyelids, and then put His hands on his eyes and asked, “Can you already see something now?”
\p
\v 24 When the man looked around, he said, “Yes, I can see people, but they look like walking trees.”
\p
\v 25 Then Jesus put His hands on the man's eyes again, and when the blind man tried to see, he could already see clearly.
\v 26 Then Jesus told him to go home to his house, but Jesus forbid him to go through that village.
\s Peter says that Jesus is the King of Salvation
\r (Mat. 16:13-20, Luke 9:18-21, John 6:66-71)
\p
\v 27 After that, Jesus and His disciples went to the villages around the region of the city of Caesarea Philippi. On the way He asked them, “People say that I'm ministering in a position like who?”\f + \fr 8:17 \fk ministering … \ft Literally Jesus asks, “Who am I?” The purpose of this question wasn't to ask what His name was, because then of course their answer would be “Everyone knows Your name is Jesus.” Compare with Mrk. 6:14-16.\f*
\p
\v 28 They answered, “There are those who say that You're a replacement for John the Baptist, and those who say You're the Prophet Elijah who has come back to life, and other people also say that You're one of the prophets from times past who has come back to life.”
\p
\v 29 Then He asked them again, “But what's your opinion about Me?”
\p Peter answered, “You're the Christ,\f + \fr 8:29 \fk the Christ \ft See the note in Mark 1:1.\f* whom God has promised.”
\p
\v 30 And Jesus firmly forbid them not to tell anybody about His position.
\s Jesus begins to teach that He'll suffer and be killed
\r (Mat. 6:21-28, Luke 9:22-27)
\p
\v 31 After that, Jesus began to teach His students that— as the Son of Man, He was appointed by God to suffer much, and be rejected by the Jewish leaders, chief priests, and Law experts. And He also told them, “After I'm killed, I'll come back to life from death on the third day.”
\v 32 He taught that clearly to them, but Peter thought it couldn't be possible for the King of Salvation to suffer, so he took Jesus aside so that he could speak to Him privately, and began to rebuke Him, “Teacher, you mustn't talk like that!”
\p
\v 33 But Jesus turned and looked at His disciples, and rebuked Peter, “Get away from Me, you devil! For what you're thinking didn't come from God, but from man.”
\s The determination to become Jesus' followers
\r (Mat. 10:37-39; Luke 14:25-33)
\p
\v 34 After that, He called to the crowd who were following Him and to His disciples, and said to them, “Everyone who wants to follow Me has to leave his own self interests,\f + \fr 8:34 \fk leave his own self interests \ft Literally, "deny himself.”\f* and follow Me continually, thinking like this, ‘To the point of death— even to death by crucifixion,\f + \fr 10:38 \fk even to death by crucifixion \ft Literally, “he must carry the cross for himself.”\f* I'll keep following the Lord.’
\v 35 For everyone who tries to keep his life will still die. But a person who's killed because of following Me, or because of telling the Good News about me, will live forever.
\v 36 Think about this: What good is it for you to become so rich that all the wealth of the world becomes your possession, but then you die immediately, without having eternal life?
\v 37 After death, what possessions can you trade with God anymore— so that you're allowed to live again? It's impossible— isn't it?!
\v 38 People in this age are becoming more evil and aren't faithful to God. So while you live among them, don't be ashamed to acknowledge, 'I'm a follower of Jesus and His teaching.' For whoever is ashamed to acknowledge Me, I won't acknowledge him as My follower either, when I come in the glory of My Father and with the heavenly angels.”
