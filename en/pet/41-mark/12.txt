\s A Parable: The Jews always reject God's messengers
\r (Mat. 21:33-46, Luke 20:9-19, Isaiah 5:1-7)
\p
\v 1 Then Jesus began to teach the Jewish religious leaders by using some parables. This was one of the parables: “There was a landowner who ordered his servants to make a large vineyard, complete with a fence around it. Then they dug a pit as a place to press grapes, and built a high guard post, to guard the vineyard from thieves and animals. When everything was finished, he rented out the vineyard to some tenant farmers, then he and all of his servants went to another land.
\v 2 When harvest time came, he ordered a servant to go back to the tenant farmers to get his share of the vineyard's produce.
\v 3 But the farmers captured his servant and beat him, then they ordered him to go home empty-handed.
\v 4 Then the owner of the vineyard told another of his servants to go to them, but they verbally abused him, and beat him on the head, until he was wounded.
\v 5 After that, the owner of the vineyard sent another servant again, but the farmers killed him. They continued to treat every servant like that, who came to collect the produce. They beat some, and they killed some.
\v 6 Finally, there was no one else that he could send, except the only son whom he really loved. So he ordered his son to go too, because he thought, ‘They'll honor my own son, for sure.’
\p
\v 7 “But when they saw the son coming, they said to each other, ‘Look! The one who's coming is his own son. He's the one who'll become the owner of the vineyard later on, after his father dies. Let's kill him, so that the vineyard becomes our property.’
\v 8 Then they captured him and killed him. After that they threw his body out of the vineyard.
\p
\v 9 “So just think: If that's so, what will the owner of the vineyard do? He himself will come and kill those tenants, of course. Then he'll rent out the vineyard to other people.”
\v 10 Then Jesus said to them again, “How long will it take before you understand God's Word, because it was written like this,
\q ‘The stone which was considered to be useless by the builders,
\q God made it become the most important foundation stone.
\q
\v 11 What God did is really amazing to us.’”\x + Psalms 118:22-23\x*
\p
\v 12 The leaders of the Jews who were listening to that parable knew that they were the ones Jesus meant by the evil tenants, so they looked for a way to arrest Jesus. But they were afraid of the crowd that was present there too, so they went away and left Him.
\s The Jewish leaders want to trick Jesus into opposing the Roman government
\r (Mat. 22:15-22, Luke 20:19-26)
\p
\v 13 Then the Jewish leaders ordered some people from the Pharisee group and some of King Herod's friends to go to Jesus. They went with the purpose of tricking Jesus— which was to persuade Jesus to speak against the government and be overheard by Herod's friends.
\v 14 When they came, they said to Him, “Teacher, we know that you Sir are an honest man who truly teaches according to God's will and do not take notice of other people's opinions. You don't change your teaching in order to be praised by people who have a high position. So we want to ask: According to the Law, are we allowed to pay taxes to the Roman government, or not?”
\p
\v 15 But Jesus knew that they were just pretending to ask. So He answered, “You think you can trap Me with a question like that! Show Me a silver coin that's usually used to pay the tax.”
\v 16 So they showed Him a coin, and He asked, “Whose face is engraved here, and whose name is written here?”
\p They answered: “The king of Rome.”
\p
\v 17 Then He said to them, “If that's so, give back to the king what the king must possess, and give back to God what God must possess.”
\p When they heard this answer they were utterly amazed.
\p
\s People from the Sadducee group ask Jesus about coming back to life after death
\r (Mat. 22:23-33, Luke 20:27-40)
\p
\v 18 After that, people from the Sadducee group\f + \fr 12:18 \fk Sadducee group \ft Most of the members of the Sadducee group were leaders of the Jewish religion, and most of them were priests. They only believed in the first five books of the Old Testament written by Moses: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. See Acts 23:8.\f* also came to Jesus. (The Sadducee group believed that no one who died would live again.)
\v 19 They said to Jesus, “Teacher, Moses wrote a rule for us like this, ‘If a man dies before he has children, then his brother is obligated to marry the widow in order to continue the family line for the brother who died.’\x + Deut. 25:5\x*
\v 20 So there were seven brothers. The first one married a young woman, but the man died and didn't yet have a child from that wife.
\v 21 Then the second brother married the widow, but he died without having any children either. And the same thing happened to his next brother.
\v 22 The same thing kept happening until the seven brothers died. They all died without having children by that widow, and finally the widow died too.
\v 23 So later on, if it's true that people are raised up after death, then whose wife will the widow be called? For the seven brothers had been the husband of that woman.”
\p
\v 24 Then Jesus answered, “You're really mistaken, because you don't know what's written in the Holy Bible, and you don't know the power of God.
\v 25 For when dead people come back to life later on, they won't marry again. They'll live like the angels in heaven, who never marry.
\p
\v 26 But with regard to coming back to life after death, how long will it be until you understand what's written in the Book of Moses?! For when God showed Himself to Moses in the burning bush, He said, ‘I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.’\x + Ex. 3:6\x*
\v 27 God spoke of our three forefathers as men who still live and worship Him. Even though by Moses' time they had died and were no longer on earth, they still live before God. So you're really mistaken!”
\s Jesus tells about God's most important command
\r (Mat. 22:34-40, Luke 10:25-28)
\p
\v 28 While Jesus was still arguing with the Sadducees, a Law expert came and heard them talking. When he noticed that Jesus had answered their question well, he also asked Jesus, “In your opinion, of all the laws, which command is the most important?”
\p
\v 29 Then Jesus answered them, “This is the most important one:
\q ‘All people of Israel, listen! The Lord your God is the One and only Lord.
\q
\v 30 Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your breath, with all your mind, and with all your strength.’\f + \fr 12:30 \fk strength \ft What is translated here as 'strength', is usually translated in the Indonesian language as 'soul'. But the meaning of this word in the Greek language is very broad, so it can include the person's whole identity, including physical and spiritual life.\f*
\m
\v 31 And there's also a second command— which is,
\q ‘Love your fellow man just like you love yourself.’\x + Deut. 6:4-5; Lev. 19:18\x*
\m There are no other commands that are more important than these two commands.”
\p
\v 32 Then the Law expert said to Jesus, “Very true, Teacher. Of course there's only one God, and there's no other god besides Him.
\v 33 And we must love God with all our hearts, with all our minds and with all our strength, and we also have to love everyone like we love ourselves. These two commands are more important than all the rules about sacrificing animals or other things to God.”
\p
\v 34 When Jesus saw that the man answered wisely, He said to him, “You've almost become a citizen of God's kingdom.” After that, everyone from the Jewish religious groups became ashamed and didn't dare ask Jesus any more questions.
\s Jesus shows that He's not just a descendant of David
\r (Mat. 22:41-46, Luke 20:41-44)
\p
\v 35 While Jesus was still teaching in God's Temple, He said, “Why do the Law experts teach this?— 'The Christ\f + \fr 12:35 \fk The Christ \ft See note in Mark 1:1.\f* will come as a descendant of David.’
\v 36 Whereas David— when empowered by God's Spirit said,
\q 'The Lord God said to my Lord,
\q “Sit at My right side and rule as King,
\q2 and I will defeat all Your enemies and make them Your slaves.”’\x + Ps. 110:1\x*
\m
\v 37 So David himself really respected the Christ by calling Him ‘my Lord.’ If so, why do the Law experts say that the King of Salvation is just a descendant of David?”
\p The crowd that was there really enjoyed hearing Jesus teach.
\s Jesus teaches not to copy the Law experts
\r (Mat. 23:1-36; Luke 11:37-54, 20:45-47)
\p
\v 38 While Jesus was still teaching there, He said, “Watch out! Don't immitate the Law experts. They like to walk around and show themselves off in public places by wearing beautiful clothes. And when they walk around in the market, they're happy when people greet them with complete respect.
\v 39 And they also like to sit in the front row seats in the synagogues or at dinner parties.
\v 40 They usually deceive widows too, by using excuses like this, 'I'll help you manage the property of your husband who died', but they actually only pretend to help because they want to steal some of the property. And to cover up their evil, they pray lengthy prayers in the synagogues, so that people will think they're good people. As a result of those deeds, God will give them a very harsh punishment, for sure.”
\s A poor widow who gave all her money to God
\r (Luke 21:1-4)
\p
\v 41 While Jesus was still in the courtyard of God's Temple, He sat facing the offering box while watching the people who put money into the box. Many rich people put in a lot of money.
\v 42 Then a poor widow came and put in two coins of the least value.
\p
\v 43 So Jesus called His disciples and said, "I'm telling you the truth: The value of this poor widow's offering was greater than everyone else's offerings here— even those rich people.
\v 44 For they gave a little of their abundant wealth, whereas the widow, who's very poor, gave everything she owned— which was all the money she had to live on.”
