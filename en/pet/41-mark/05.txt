\s Jesus drives evil spirits out of a man from the Gerasenes
\r (Mat. 8:28-34; Luke 8:26-39)
\p
\v 1 Then Jesus and His disciples arrived at the other side of the lake, in the region around the city of Gergesa.\f + \fr 5:1 \fk Gergesa \ft In several ancient copies, this name is written “Gadara.”\f*
\v 2 When Jesus got out of the boat, a man controlled by an evil spirit immediately came to Him from where he lived in a grave yard\f + \fr 5:2 \fk grave yard \ft At that time, the Jews often buried the bodies of dead people in caves or in small rooms dug into rocky hills. This event speaks of many unclean things: evil spirits, a graveyard, pigs, and the region of non-Jewish people. All of these things were considered to be unclean by the Jews.\f* that had caves.
\v 3 The man used the caves in the graveyard as his place to live, and he was very dangerous. The Gerasene people had often tied him up, but he could get loose, even when he was bound with iron chains.
\v 4 When his feet and hands were bound with iron chains, he broke the chains, and smashed the chain on his feet until it broke. No one could restrain him.
\v 5 The man was in the graveyard caves and surrounding hills day and night, and He often screamed and cut his body with stones.
\p
\v 6 When he saw Jesus from far away, he ran and knelt down in front of Him.
\v 7-8 Then Jesus said repeatedly to the evil spirit, “Hey you evil spirits, get out of that man!” Then the man cried out in a loud voice, “Jesus, Son of the most high God, why're you\f + \fr 5:7-8 \fk you \ft A small letter is used here for the pronoun to replace Jesus' name. Even though the evil spirits knew that Jesus was God's Son, they didn't truly respect and submit to Him. Compare to James 2:19\f* bothering me? I beg you to promise in God's name that you won't torture me.”
\p
\v 9 Then Jesus asked, “What's your name?”
\p The demons who were inside the man answered, “Battalion,\f + \fr 5:9 \fk Battalion \ft In the Greek language, his name was Legion. At that time, a legion was a military battalion composed of as many as 6826 members.\f* because we who control him are many.”
\v 10 And the demons begged Jesus over and over again not to chase them away from that region.
\p
\v 11 At that time, there was a large herd of domestic pigs eating on the side of a steep hill.
\v 12 So the evil spirits begged Jesus, “Give us permission to enter those pigs.”
\v 13 Then Jesus agreed, and the evil spirits immediately went out of the man and entered the pigs. Then the pigs ran quickly and fell off the side of the slope into the lake, and drowned. The total number of pigs was about two thousand.
\p
\v 14 When the pig herders saw what had happened, they ran and told about it in the city and the surrounding region. Then the people who heard the news went to see what had happened.
\v 15 When they came to the place where Jesus was, they saw the man who had been controlled by those evil spirits sitting calmly, and wearing clothes. His sane thinking had returned. Seeing what had happened made them afraid of Jesus.
\v 16 And the pig herders, who had seen that happen themselves, told what had happened to the people who had just come, too.
\v 17 After that, they asked Jesus to leave their region.
\p
\v 18 When Jesus got into the boat, the man who had been called Battalion asked Jesus over and over again if he could go with Him.
\v 19 But Jesus didn't agree. He said to the man, “Go home and tell your family and the people in your village how God had compassion on you and helped you.”
\v 20 Then the man went to the Ten Cities province\f + \fr 5:20 \fk Ten Cities province \ft Literally “Decapolis”. The name Decapolis means “ten cities.” The residents of that region, who spoke Greek, were given permission by the Roman government to have their own government. (Each city had its own government.) Most of the people who lived there weren't Jews.\f* and told how Jesus had helped him in such an amazing way. And everyone who heard his testimony was amazed.
\s Jesus heals a woman with a bleeding ailment, and brings Jairus' daughter back to life
\r (Mat. 9:18-26; Luke 8:40-56)
\p
\v 21 After that, Jesus and His disciples went back across to the western side of Lake Galilee. When they arrived, many people came and surrounded Him on the lakeshore.
\v 22 Then the leader of a Jewish synagogue, whose name was Jairus, came to Him. When he saw Jesus, he immediately knelt down at His feet.
\v 23 He begged Jesus earnerstly, “My little girl is seriously ill and almost dead. Please Sir, come to my house! Lay your hands on her, so that she'll be healed and won't die.”
\p
\v 24 Then Jesus and His disciples went with him. But as they were going, many people followed them, to the point that they were all pressing in around Jesus.
\v 25 There was also a woman who had suffered from a bleeding ailment for twelve years.
\v 26 She had spent all of her money to be treated by many doctors, but they weren't able to heal her. Instead, their treatments had made her really suffer, and her ailment just got worse.
\v 27 The woman had heard about Jesus, so she followed Him from behind, along with the crowd, and touched His robe.
\v 28 She did that because she thought, “If I just touch the edge of His robe, I'll be healed for sure.”
\v 29 When she did that, her bleeding stopped immediately, and she knew that her ailment had been healed.
\p
\v 30 Jesus immediately felt that power had gone out of Him, so He turned and asked the crowd, “Who just touched My robe?”
\p
\v 31 Then His disciples answered, “Sir, You can see for Yourself how many people are pressing in. Why did You ask who touched Your robe?”
\p
\v 32 But Jesus kept looking and searching for the person who had touched His robe.
\v 33 Then the woman shook and was afraid because He knew what she had done,\f + \fr 5:33 \fk shook and was afraid … \ft The woman was afraid to admit that she had touched Jesus because according to the Law and Jewish culture, a person sick with a bleeding ailment was ritually unclean and dirty, and couldn't touch a healthy, ritually clean person. (Lev.15:19-30).\f* so she knelt down in front of Jesus' feet and told Him what she had done.
\v 34 Then Jesus said to her, “My child, because you believe in Me completely, you were healed. Go home now with a calm heart, because you've truly been healed from your ailment.”
\p
\v 35 While Jesus was still speaking with the woman, some people came from Jairus' house and said to him, “Sir, your child has already died, so you don't need to bother the Teacher anymore. It's pointless.”
\p
\v 36 Of course Jesus heard what they said to Jairus, but it didn't bother Him. Then He said to Jairus, “Don't be afraid. Just keep on believing in Me.”
\p
\v 37 And Jesus didn't allow any other people to follow Him, except Peter and the two brothers, James and John.
\v 38 When they arrived at Jairus' house, they saw the noisy people who were crying in loud voices.
\v 39 Then Jesus went in and said to them, “Why're you being so noisy and crying! The child isn't dead, she's just sleeping.”
\p
\v 40 The people laughed at Him, but Jesus ordered all of them to go out. And He invited the child's parents and His three disciples to enter the room where the child was.
\v 41 Then Jesus held the child's hand and said in their language, “Talitha cumi.” (It means, “Hey little girl, I'm telling you to ‘Wake up!’”)
\v 42 The girl got up immediately and walked. She was twelve years old. And everyone who was there was really amazed.
\v 43 But Jesus strictly forbid them to tell other people about this. Then He ordered the child's parents to feed her.
