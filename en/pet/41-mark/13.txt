\s Jesus teaches about the end of the age
\r (Mat. 24:1-44, Luke 21:5-33)
\p
\v 1 As Jesus was leaving God's Temple, one of His disciples said to Him, “Teacher, look! God's Temple is so awesome! The stones are so huge!”
\p
\v 2 Then Jesus answered, “Yes, pay attention to all these great buildings! The time is coming when everything you see will be demolished— so that there won't be even one stone stacked on top of another.”
\p
\v 3 After that, Jesus and His disciples went to the Mount of Olives. Jesus sat there by Himself and faced God's Temple. Then Peter, James, John and Andrew came to Him and asked,
\v 4 “Teacher, please tell us when those things will happen? And what signs will we see before all of that happens?”
\p
\v 5 Then Jesus answered them, “Be careful, so that you aren't deceived by other people.
\v 6 Many people will appear and say, ‘I'm the Christ that you're waiting for’, so that they'll lead many people astray.
\v 7 When you hear about wars that are going on, or will happen, don't worry, because it isn't a sign that it's the end of the age! Those things must happen according to God's plan, of course.
\v 8 There will be wars between ethnic groups and between countries. There'll be earthquakes and famines everywhere. But all of that is just the beginning. Those things can be compared with a pregnant woman who beings to feel pain as a sign of giving birth. And then the pains will increase even more until the child is born.
\p
\v 9 “Guard yourselves well! For those who oppose Me will arrest many of you and bring you to the council of religious leaders, and some of you will be beaten in their synagogoues. And they'll also bring you to face kings or government heads. At that time they'll report you like this, ‘He's a follower of Jesus, too.’ But all of that will happen according to God's will, so that you can witness to them about Me.
\v 10 And God has determined that before the end of the world, the Good News about Me must be told to every ethnic group in the whole world.
\v 11 And when you're arrested and brought to court, you don't need to worry about how you will answer. For when they're questioning you, at that very moment God's Spirit will tell you what you must answer. It won't actually be you speaking at that time, but the Holy Spirit will speak through you.
\p
\v 12 Later on there will be people who will hand their own brothers over to the religious leaders to be killed. And there will also be fathers who hand over their children to be killed. And there will also be children who oppose their parents and hand them over to the religious leaders to be killed.
\v 13 Everyone will hate you because you believe in Me. But whoever continues to believe in Me and follow Me until the end, will be saved.
\p
\v 14 “I'm giving you this sign: You'll see a king who'll establish 'something in God's Temple that's very spiritually unclean and is a sign of destruction.'\x + Dan. 9:27, 11:31, 12:11\x* When you see that disaster, you people who're in Jerusalem and the province of Judea must run away to the mountains.”
\q I— Mark, ask the person reading this book to other people: Please explain those words of Jesus to the listeners. Jesus continued to teach,
\m
\v 15 “At that time, if any of you are on the terrace of your house,\f + \fr 13:15 \fk on the terrace of your house \ft Mark literally wrote “on top of your house”. In the land of Israel, the roof of houses were flat, and used like a terrace or yard.\f* don't go into the house to take anything. Just run away immediately!
\v 16 It's the same if you're working in your garden. Don't go home to get your outer robe.
\v 17 At the time of that disaster, pity pregnant and nursing mothers. They'll really suffer because it'll be difficult for them to run away.
\v 18 Ask in prayer that this disaster won't happen in winter. If it does, it'll be even more difficult.
\v 19 For great trouble will happen in those days. Trouble like that has never happened since God created the world until now. And after that, trouble like that won't ever happen again.\x + Dan. 12:1.\x*
\v 20 But because of God's compassion on His chosen people who'll still be living on earth at that time, He has decided that this most terrifying disaster can't be long. If it was too long, no one would be able to endure life in this world.'
\p
\v 21 At that time, if someone says, ‘Look! The Christ whom we're waiting for is here now,’ or, ‘He's there,’ don't believe it.
\v 22 For in the days to come, many people will come and do all kinds of miracles in order to lead you astray. They'll claim that they're prophets who give news from God, or there will also be those who claim, ‘I'm the Christ whom you're waiting for.’ Their deception will be so extraordinary, that even God's chosen people will almost be led astray too.
\v 23 So guard yourself! Remember that I've told you all of this before it happens.
\s Jesus teaches about His return
\r (Mat. 24:29-31, Luke 21:25-28)
\p
\v 24 “But at the time that great trouble is done,
\q ‘The sun will become dark,
\q and the moon won't shine any more.
\q
\v 25 And the stars will even fall from the sky,
\q and all of the authorities of the powers of darkness who're in the heavens will be brought down.’\f + \fr 13:25 \fk Verse 24-25 \ft These things were prophesied in Is. 13:10, 34:4; Ez. 32:7; Joel 2:10, 2:31, 3:15. The second line is literally, “and the authorities that are in (the levels of) the heavens will be shaken.”\f*
\p
\v 26 “At that time, everyone will see the Son of Man— who I am, come from heaven in clouds with power and great radiance.
\v 27 Then I'll order My angels to gather the people who've been chosen by God. They'll be gathered from everywhere on earth, from the eastern end to the western end, and from the northern end to the southern end.
\p
\v 28 “We can illustrate the sign of the end of the age with a fig tree. If its branches become soft and shoots begin to be seen, you know that summer is near.
\v 29 In the same way, if you see those signs start to happen, you should know that the time for My return is near.
\v 30 I'm telling you the truth: All of those signs will happen while people of this age are still living.
\v 31 Of course all of those things will happen. It's more likely that the sky and earth will disappear, than that this teaching of Mine won't happen.
\s Advice to be on guard
\r (Mat. 24:36-44; Luke 17:26-30, 34-36)
\p
\v 32 “But not even one person knows the day or the hour that I'll return to this earth. The angels in heaven don't know, and I, as God's Son don't know either. Only the Father Himself knows when that will happen.
\v 33 So you must be careful and be on guard, because you don't know the time that I'll return.
\v 34 The situation is like when a land owner wants to go to a distant place. Before leaving home, he divides the duties with each of his servants and explains each one's responsibility and duty. Then he says to the doorkeeper, 'Guard well until I return!'
\v 35 They stay ready and on guard, because they don't know when the master of the house will return— whether in the afternoon, at midnight, at the time the rooster crows, or in the morning. In the same way, you must always be on guard too.
\v 36 Don't let Me arrive suddenly and find you aren't alert but sleeping!
\v 37 What I'm saying is not just for you who're listening but for everyone: Always be ready and on guard!”
