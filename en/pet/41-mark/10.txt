\s Jesus' teaching about husbands and wives
\p
\v 1 Then Jesus left that place and went across to the east side of the Jordan River, in the province of Judea. Many people were coming to Him there, and as usual, Jesus taught them.
\v 2 At that time, some Pharisees came to Jesus to test Him. They asked Him, “Is a husband allowed to divorce his wife?”
\v 3 Then Jesus answered, “What did Moses command you about this matter?”
\v 4 They said, “Moses gave permission to a husband to divorce his wife by giving her a letter explaining the divorce.’”\x Deut. 24:1.\x*
\v 5 So Jesus said to them, “Moses wrote that command for you because your hearts are hard, and you don't know how to love your wives.
\v 6 But the true will of God was already clear when He created this world,
\q ‘He created just one man and one woman.’\x + Gen. 1:27; 5:2\x*
\q
\v 7 ‘For that reason, in marriage, a man always leaves his father and mother and is united with his bride—
\v 8 so that the two of them become one.’\x + Gen. 2:24.\x*
\m In that way, in God's eyes, a husband and wife are no longer two but one.
\v 9 For that reason, a husband and wife who've been united by God in marriage can't be separated by man.”
\p
\v 10 When Jesus and His disciples were in the house, they asked Him again about divorce.
\v 11 Jesus said to them, “If a husband divorces his wife and marries another woman again, he's living in adultery against his first wife.
\v 12 It's the same if a wife divorces her husband and marries another man again, then she's also living in adultery against her first husband.”
\s People who believe as children do will become citizens of God's kingdom
\p
\v 13 Then some people brought their children to Jesus so that He would touch the children and bless them, but His disciples strongly forbid those people.
\v 14 But when Jesus saw that, He was angry, and said to His disciples, “Allow the children to come to Me and don't forbid them, because it's people like these who become citizens of God's kingdom.
\v 15 What I'm saying is true: You have to receive God's kingdom like a child receives something from its parents. If not, you won't enter it.”
\v 16 After saying that, Jesus hugged the children, and put His hands on them and blessed them.
\s Rich people have a very hard time becoming citizens of God's kingdom
\r (Mat. 19:16-30; Luke 18:18-30)
\p
\v 17 As Jesus was leaving that house, a man ran to meet Him, then knelt down in front of Him and asked, “Good teacher, what do I have to do so that I can have eternal life?”
\p
\v 18 But Jesus asked him in return, “Why do you say that I'm good? Only God is good; no one else is.
\v 19 You already know these commandments, of course: 
\q1‘Don't kill, don't commit adultery,
\q1 don't steal, don't give a false testimony,
\q1 don't deceive, honor your mother and father.’ ”\x + Ex. 20:12-16; Deut. 5:16-20\x*
\p
\v 20 The man answered Him, “Teacher, I've done all of those things since I was young, until now.”
\p
\v 21 Jesus looked at him and felt compassion for him, and said, “There's still one more thing that you need to do: Go and sell all your possessions, then distribute the money to poor people. In that way, you'll have treasure in heaven, then come to Me and follow Me.”
\p
\v 22 The man was very disappointed when he heard what Jesus said, then he left that place with a sad heart, because he was very rich and didn't want to sell his possessions.
\p
\v 23 Jesus looked around Him and then said to His disciples: “It's really hard for rich people to become citizens of God's kingdom!”
\v 24 The disciples were amazed to hear Him say that. But Jesus said again, “My children, it's really hard to become citizens of God's kingdom!
\v 25 It's easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle,\f + \fr 10:25 \fk eye of a needle \ft There's a false teaching that has been taught almost everywhere, that at the time of Jesus there was a normal-sized door next to the gates of Jerusalem. It has been taught that the smaller door was named Eye of the Needle, and that a camel could enter there— but only if all burdens were taken off of it. But doors next to gateways like that were only found in European countries, and were only built several centuries after Jesus' time. Jesus teaching here is that it is absolutely impossible for a rich person to become a citizen of God's kingdom! But according to verse 27, what's impossible for humans to do can still happen with God's help.\f* than for a rich person to enter God's kingdom.”
\p
\v 26 When they heard that, they were even more amazed and asked each other, “If so, who can be saved and enter heaven?”
\p
\v 27 While looking at them Jesus said, “What's impossible for people, is possible for God. God is able to do anything.”
\p
\v 28 Then Peter said to Him, “How about us? We've left all of our possessions and followed You.”
\p
\v 29 Jesus answered them, “I'm telling all of you the truth: Everyone who leaves his house, his brothers and sisters, his parents, his children, or his fields to follow Me, or to tell the Good News,
\v 30 will receive a hundred times more of like kind in return, in his life now. In this world, he'll receive more houses, brothers, sisters, mothers, children and fields. Besides that, he'll also be persecuted. And in the end, he'll also receive a huge reward in the world to come— that is eternal life.
\v 31 But many people who have a high status now, will have a low status in days to come. And people who have a low status now, will have a high status in days to come.
\s Jesus tells about His Death
\p
\v 32 Jesus and His disciples, and several other people, went to Jerusalem. Jesus walked in front of them. His disciples were amazed, but the crowd who followed them from behind were afraid, because they knew that there were people in the city who were angry at Jesus. Then Jesus gathered His twelve disciples together again privately, and told them what would happen to Him.
\v 33 “Listen carefully! We're heading for Jerusalem. The Son of Man— who I am, will be turned over to the chief priests and Law experts. They'll pronounce the death sentence on Me, then they'll turn Me over to the high officials who aren't Jewish.
\v 34 The non-Jewish people will mock Me, spit on Me, beat Me, and kill Me. But on the third day after I die, I'll come back to life.”
\s Request of James and John
\p
\v 35 After that, James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to Jesus and said, “Teacher, we want to ask You to do something for us.”
\p
\v 36 Then Jesus asked, “What do you want Me to do for you?”
\p
\v 37 Then they answered, “When You become King later on, and sit on the throne of Your kingdom, allow the two of us to sit at Your right side and at Your left side in Your glory.”
\p
\v 38 But Jesus answered, “You don't understand what you're asking. Are you ready to receive the suffering that I'm going to experience? Can you bear the great trouble that I'm going to experience later on?”\f + \fr 10:38 \fk suffer … trouble \ft Literally, “Are you able to drink the cup that I'll drink, or be baptized with the baptism that I'll be baptized with?”\f*
\p
\v 39 They answered, “We can.”
\p Then Jesus said, “You will suffer and bear great trouble just like I'm going to experience, for sure.
\v 40 But I don't have the right to choose who will sit at My right or left side, because those two seats have been prepared for people who've been chosen by God.”
\p
\v 41 When the other ten disciples heard James and John's request, they were very angry with those two brothers.
\v 42 Then Jesus called all of His disciples and said, “You already know that the leaders of non-Jewish people groups and everyone who considers himself to be a leader, govern the people harshly and trample on their rights.
\v 43 But you can't be like them. If one of you wants to be the most important person, he has to take the lowliest place and become your servant.
\v 44 And whoever wants to become number one, has to become your slave.
\v 45 You must follow My example, because I— the Son of Man, didn't come to this earth to be served by other people, but to serve them, and to give My life to save many people.”
\s Jesus makes a blind man able to see
\r (Mark 10:46-52; Luke 18:35-43)
\p
\v 46 Then Jesus, with His disciples and the crowd, arrived in Jericho. And when they left that city, there was a blind beggar named Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, who always sat by the roadside to beg.
\v 47 And he heard that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by, so he cried out, saying, “Jesus, Descendant of David,\f + \fr 10:47 \fk Descendant of David \ft Literally, “Son of David.” When the blind man called Jesus 'Descendant of David', he didn't just mean that Jesus was from the family of David. For before Jesus came, the prophets had prophesied that the King of Salvation would come from the descendants of King David. So all the Jews called the King of Salvation by the words 'Descendant of David'. Because of the words of the prophets, they also thought, “He'll also heal sick and blind people”, so that man already knew that Jesus was no ordinary person. See Is. 29:18-19, 35:4-6, 42:6-7\f* have pity on me.”
\p
\v 48 Many people were angry with him and ordered him to be quiet, but he shouted even louder, “Jesus, Descendant of David, have pity on me.”
\p
\v 49 Jesus stopped and said, “Bring him here.” Then they called the blind man and said to him, “Be joyful! Get up! Jesus is calling you.”
\v 50 The blind man quickly stood up, and took off his outer robe, and came to Jesus.
\p
\v 51 Jesus asked him, “What do you want Me to do for you?”
\p The blind man answered, “Teacher, help me be able see again.”
\p
\v 52 Jesus said to him, “Go. Because you believed in Me, you can see now.” At that very moment he could see, and he followed Jesus on the trip.
