\s Jesus heals a man with a paralyzed hand on the Sabbath Day
\r (Mat. 12:9-14; Luke 6:6-11)
\p
\v 1 When Jesus went into a Jewish synagogue again,\f + fr 3:1 \fk synagogue\ft See footnote in Mark 1:21.\f* there was a man there whose hand was paralyzed.
\v 2 There were some Pharisees there too,\f + \fr 3:2 \fk Pharisees \ft Mark literally wrote “Jews” here, but in verse 6 it's clear that he meant people from the Pharisees' group.\f* who were watching Jesus closely, because they had already planned to report Him to the Jewish leaders if He healed that man on the Sabbath Day.
\p
\v 3 Then Jesus said to the man whose hand was paralyzed, “Come and stand up front here.”
\v 4 So Jesus asked them, “According to Moses Law, what are we allowed to do on the Sabbath Day? Are we allowed to do good, or to do evil? Are we allowed to save a person's life, or to kill a person?” But no one answered.
\p
\v 5 Then Jesus looked around at those people in anger, but He also felt sad because they were so hard-headed. So He said to the man with the paralyzed hand, “Stretch out your hand in front of you!” Then the man stretched out his hand, and he was immediately healed!
\v 6 After the Pharisees left the synagogue, they immediately met with King Herod's friends to arrange plans for how to kill Jesus.
\s Jesus heals many people by the lakeshore
\p
\v 7 After that, Jesus and His disciples left that place and went to Lake Galilee. Many people— that is people from the provinces of Galilee and Judea, followed them from behind.
\v 8 And there were those who came from Jerusalem, from the region of Idumea, and from the region on the eastern side of the Jordan River too. There were also some from the region around Tyre and Sidon. They all came because they had heard about the amazing things Jesus had done.
\p
\v 9 When Jesus saw how many people had gathered, he ordered His disciples, “Get a boat ready so that I can teach from the boat, because if I teach from here, I'll get crushed.”
\v 10 Jesus healed many sick people that day, but there were still many other sick people who were pushing each other to get near Him and touch Him.
\v 11 And there were people who were controlled by evil spirits too. When the evil spirits saw Jesus, those who were controlled by the spirits immediately fell to the ground and shouted, “You're God's Son!”
\v 12 But with a loud voice, Jesus forbid the evil spirits not to tell about Him.
\s Jesus chooses twelve people to become His apostles
\r (Mat. 10:1-4; Luke 6:12-16)
\p
\v 13-14 After that, Jesus went up a hill, and He called the twelve people that He had chosen and they came to Him. He appointed them to be His apostles, so that they would be with Him, and they could also be sent to spread the news of salvation.
\v 15 He gave them power to cast out demons too.
\p
\v 16 The names of the twelve apostles that were chosen were
\li Simon— to whom Jesus gave the new name “Peter”,
\li
\v 17 and the two sons of Zebedee— namely James and John. Jesus also gave them a new name, “Boanerges.” That name means “Sons of Thunder.”\f + \fr 3:17 \fr Sons of Thunder \ft It's possible that Jesus gave them that name because the two brothers had the nature of making quick decisions and taking action immediately. So because of their quick nature, they were illustrated by thunder and lightning. (See Luke 9:54; Mark 9:38)\f*
\li
\v 18 And the others were Andrew, Philip,
\q1 Bartholomew, Matthew,
\q1 Thomas, and also James— the son of Alphaeus,
\q1 Thaddaeus, and Simon— who had followed the freedom movement that fought for Israel to be free from Roman colonization,
\q1
\v 19 and Judas— who came from the village of Cariot. He was the one who later betrayed Jesus.
\s According to the Law experts, Jesus worked by the power of Satan
\r (Mat. 12:22-32; Luke 11:14-23, 12:10)
\p
\v 20 After that, Jesus returned to the house where He usually stayed. But many people gathered there again, so Jesus and His disciples had no time at all to rest, or even to eat.
\v 21 At the time, there were people who said about Jesus, “He's crazy.” When His family heard that, they began to travel to that place to force Jesus to come home.
\p
\v 22 But there were also Law experts who came from Jerusalem, and they said, “Jesus has been controlled by the devil— who is also called Beelzebul.\f + \fr 3:22 \fr Beelzebul \ft is another name for Lucifer or the devil.\f* So it's the devil who gives Jesus power to drive out demons.”
\p
\v 23 For that reason, Jesus called the crowd together, and started telling them, “It isn't possible for the devil to drive out the spirits that are on his side.”\f + \fr 3:23 \fk It isn't possible… on his side \ft translates this rhetorical question in Greek, “How could the devil possibly drive out those on his side?” This isn't a question to gain information, but Jesus used this question to begin the point of His lesson.\f* Then Jesus taught them by using several illustrations:
\v 24-26 Satan's cohorts can't possibly be divided and oppose each other. This can be illustrated by a country or a family: If they oppose each other and go to war against each other, that country or family will be destroyed. So it's clear that the devil can't give power to Me to drive out the spirits that are on his side, because if that happened, the devil's kingdom would be destroyed.
\v 27 I'm here as the devil's enemy, and came to snatch his possessions from him. No one's brave enough to simply go in and steal from a very strong person's house. But before going in, he has to tie up the strong person first, and only then can he go into his house and steal his possessions.
\p
\v 28 “What I'm saying is true: God is ready to forgive all kinds of people's sins, including the sin of insulting Him.
\v 29 But people who insult the Holy Spirit\f + \fr 3:29 \fk insult the Holy Spirit \ft Jesus advises them about the sin of insulting the Holy Spirit because the Law experts had said, “Jesus is controlled by the devil”, and also “Jesus works by the power of the devil.” (verses 22 and 30) Their hearts were so closed to Jesus, that the good things He did through the power of God's Spirit were considered to be evil. It isn't possible for a person who thinks like that to repent. Thoughts that insult God's Spirit can be illustrated by 1 John 5:16— where John wrote about “the sin that brings death,” that also can't be forgiven. But for us Christians today, we don't need to be afraid, thinking, “Have I ever insulted God's Spirit and God won't forgive me?” If we still feel sad and ask for forgiveness when we fall into sin, and if we still want to live right in God's eyes, it's obvious that God's Spirit is still working in our hearts. If we still want to repent, we haven't yet committed the sin of insulting God's Spirit.\f* will never be forgiven by God for such a great sin. They have to bear that sin forever.”
\v 30 Jesus said this because of the people who had insulted Him by saying, “Jesus has been controlled by an evil spirit.”
\s The character of people whom Jesus considers to be His family
\r Mat. 12:46-50, Luke 8:19-21
\p
\v 31 At that very moment, Jesus' mother and brothers arrived at the house and were waiting outside. They asked people to call Him.
\v 32 At the time, Jesus was sitting inside the house, surrounded by a crowd of people. Then some people told Him, “Teacher, your mother and your brothers want to meet with you. They're waiting outside.”
\p
\v 33 But Jesus answered, “Now I'll show you the people I consider to be My mother and My brothers and sisters!”\f + \fr 3:33 \fk My brothers and sisters\ft As in Mark. 3:23, Jesus begins the point of His lesson with a rhetorical question that's translated as a statement.\f*
\v 34 Then He looked at the people who were sitting near Him and said, “People like these are the ones I consider to be My mother and My brothers and sisters—
\v 35 that is people who obey the will of God. They're the ones whom I consider to be My mother, My brothers and My sisters.”
