\s Jesus is handed over to Pilate
\r (Mat. 27:1-2, Luke 23:1-5, John 18:28-38)
\p
\v 1 Very early in the morning, the whole Religious Court council— that is the chief priests, Jewish leaders, and Law experts, made a plan to use the Roman government officials to kill Jesus. Then they tied Him up and brought Him to be handed over to Governor Pilate.
\p
\v 2 After they reported the accusations to Pilate, he asked Jesus, “Are you really the king of the Jews?”
\p Jesus answered, “Yes, that's right.”
\p
\v 3 Then the chief priests reported many accusations about Jesus' wrong-doings.
\v 4 So Pilate asked Jesus again, “Don't you want to answer them, because they're saying you've done many wrong things.”
\v 5 But Jesus still didn't answer anything, so Pilate was really amazed.
\s Pilate hands Jesus over for the death sentence
\r (Mat. 27:15-26, Luke 23:13-25, John 18:39-19:16)
\p
\v 6 Every year in Jerusalem, on Passover Day, the governor always released one person from prison, in agreement with the people's request.
\v 7 At that time, there was a man in prison whose name was Barabbas. He was arrested and put in prison together with some other people, because they had caused a riot against the Roman government. Barabbas had killed someone in that uproar.
\v 8 So it happened that a crowd came to Governor Pilate that morning and asked, “Will you release a prisoner today— like you usually do, Sir?”
\p
\v 9 Then Pilate answered them, “Do you want me to release the king of the Jews to you?”
\v 10 Pilate said that on purpose, because he knew that the chief priests envied Jesus. He knew that this was the reason they had handed Jesus over to him.
\v 11 But the chief priests persuaded the crowd to ask Pilate to release Barabbas— not Jesus.
\v 12 Then Pilate asked them again, “If so, what do you want me to do with this man— the one you call ‘king of the Jews?’”
\p
\v 13 But they shouted, “Crucify him!”\f + \fr 15:13 \fk Crucify him! \ft At the time of Jesus, the government of Rome used a special way to carry out the death penalty on criminals— which was by crucifixion. They made a cross from two beams of wood in the shape of the letter T. Before the criminal was crucified, he was whipped until almost dead, then nailed with long nails to that cross. His two hands were lifted up and nailed to the left and right of the cross. His two feet were also nailed to the cross. Then the cross was raised by planting it in a hole in the ground or in a large stone. The person who was crucified on a cross usually didn't die immediately. He could live for hours or days, and suffered terribly. A person who was sentenced to die by crucifixion didn't only suffer in a physical way, but was also deeply shamed, because criminals who were sentenced like that were always crucified naked, and the people who passed by that place would insult and make fun of them. The death sentence by crucifixion was never used for citizens of the kingdom of Rome, but was only used for slaves, or people from other countries that were colonized by the kingdom of Rome.\f*
\p
\v 14 Then Pilate asked them again, “Why? What has he done wrong?”
\p But they shouted even louder, “Crucify him!”
\p
\v 15 And because Pilate wanted the crowd to be happy with him, he released Barabbas to them. Then he handed Jesus over to his soldiers, so they could whip Him and crucify Him.
\s The soldiers mock Jesus
\r (Mat. 27:27-31, John 19:2-3)
\p
\v 16 Then the soldiers led Jesus into their barracks which was part of the governor's palace, and they called the other soldiers to gather there.
\v 17 After whipping, they began to mock Jesus. They exchanged the robe Jesus was wearing for a commander's purple robe, because that color was usually worn by kings too. And from a thorny branch they made a crown and put it on Jesus' head.
\v 18 Then they pretended to honor Jesus by shouting, “Greetings, king of the Jews!”
\v 19 After that, they hit Jesus' head with a club and some of them spit on Him too. Then some of them pretended to honor Him by kneeling down in front of Jesus too, as if giving honor to a king.
\v 20 After they mocked Him like that, they took off the purple robe and exchanged it for His own robe. Then they led Jesus out to be crucified.
\s Jesus is crucified
\r (Mat. 27:32-44, Luke 23:26-43, John 19:17-27)
\p
\v 21 While they were on the way to the place where Jesus would be crucified, they met a man from Cyrene who had just returned from outside the city. The man's name was Simon— and he was the father of Alexander and Rufus. Then the soldiers forced\f + \fr 15:21 \fk forced \ft translates a special term in the Greek language, which can also be translated "commanded." In every province where the Roman government colonized the people, all Roman soldiers were allowed to command people to carry baggage for them. This incident showed that Jesus was already too weak to carry His own cross.\f* Simon to carry Jesus' cross.
\v 22 They led Jesus to a place called Golgotha, which means “place of the skull in the Hebrew language.”\f + \fr 15:22 \fk Golgotha \ft The name Mark used for that place came from the everyday Hebrew language. In the Latin language— or the language of Itali and the capitol city of Rome, it was called Calvary. That hill was to the north of Jerusalem. The hill wasn't named that because there were skulls of people, but it happened that the hill had a large rock formation that stuck out, that was shaped like a human skull.\f*
\v 23 They gave wine to Him there, which was mixed with the sap of the myrrh tree, but Jesus refused it.
\p
\v 24 Then the soldiers crucified Him, and they divided His clothes among them by throwing lots.\f + \fk 15:24 \fk throwing … lots \ft Mark purposely made this verse look like Ps. 22:18. Jesus fulfilled what was written in this verse.\f*
\v 25 They crucified Jesus around nine o'clock in the morning.
\v 26 Then they attached a board above His cross with the charge against Jesus— which said, “This is the king of the Jews.”
\v 27-28 They also crucified two thieves along with Jesus, one on His right side, and the other on His left side.\f + \fr 15:28 \fk Difference in copies\ft Some ancient copies added these words which were later considered to be verse 28: So this fulfilled God's Word given by a prophet, “He'll be treated like a criminal.”\f*
\p
\v 29 The people who passed that place insulted Him. They shook their heads and said, “Hey, you said earlier that you would demolish God's Temple and rebuild it in only three days.
\v 30 Save yourself and come down from that cross!”
\p
\v 31 It was the same with the chief priests and Law experts who were there. They laughed and mocked Him in loud voices like this, “What a pity! He has saved other people, but he can't save himself!
\v 32 If he really is the Christ, the King of Salvation for the people of Israel, let him come down from that cross! Then we can believe in him.” And the two criminals who were crucified with Jesus, also joined in insulting Him.
\s Jesus dies
\r (Mat. 27:45-56, Luke 23:44-49, John 19:28-30)
\p
\v 33 At twelve o'clock noon, that whole area suddenly became dark, until three o'clock in the afternoon.
\v 34 Around three o'clock, Jesus cried out with a loud voice, “Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?”, which means, “My God, My God, why did You forsake Me?”\x + Ps. 22:2\x*
\p
\v 35 Then some people who were standing there misheard what Jesus said, and they said, “Listen! He's calling the Prophet Elijah.”
\v 36 After that, a person ran to get a piece of sponge\f + \fr 15:36 \fk sponge \ft A type of coral flower that can absorb water to be transported.\f* and attached it to the tip of a bamboo stick. Then he dipped the sponge in sour wine\f + \fr 15:36 \fk sour wine \ft When they gave the sour wine, it fulfilled what was written in Ps. 69:22.\f* and gave it to Jesus to drink. While doing that he said, “Let's wait and see if Elijah will come to take him down from the cross!”
\p
\v 37 Then Jesus cried out and died.
\v 38 When Jesus died, the curtain which always hung in the Holy Room\f + \fr 15:38 \fk curtain...Holy Room \ft That curtain was a thick cloth which was always hung in the doorway of the Holy Room. It isn't clear here if this was the curtain that was in the doorway to enter the Holy Room, or the curtain which separated the Holy Room from the Most Holy Room. The spiritual meaning of this miracle is explained in Hebrews 9, which says that there's no longer anything separating mankind from God. (See Ex. 26:31-33, Heb. 9:1-8.)\f* in God's Temple, tore by itself from top to bottom into two pieces.
\p
\v 39 When the officer\f + \fr 15:39 \fk officer \ft Literally in Greek, the word translated as 'officer' means 'leader over one hundred soldiers'.\f* who was standing there saw what happened at the moment Jesus died, he immediately said, “It's really true, this Man was God's Son!”
\p
\v 40 There were also women standing and watching there from a distance. They were Salome, Mary who came from the village of Magdala, and Mary the mother of Joseph and the younger James— who were both the younger brothers of Jesus.\f + \fr 15:40 \fk Order of names \ft The order of the names was changed so that Salome is not considered to be a sister of James and Joseph. It's possible that this Salome is the wife of Zebedee and mother of James and John, the two disciples of Jesus. (Mat. 27:56)\f*
\v 41 They were the women who usually followed Jesus and served Him while He was still in the region of Galilee. There were also many other women, who had followed Jesus' group from Galilee to Jerusalem.
\s Jesus' body is buried
\r (Mat. 27:57-61, Luke 23:50-56, John 19:38-42)
\p
\v 42 At that time, it was almost evening, and the Jews had to quickly finish getting ready for the Sabbath Day.
\v 43 For that reason, Joseph got bold to face Pilate, so he could ask permission for Jesus' body to be taken down quickly and buried. (This was Joseph from the village of Arimathea, and he was also one of the most respected members of the Jewish Religious Court. He also really longed for the time when God would begin to govern this world as King.)
\v 44 Pilate was surprised to hear that Jesus had died before night. So he ordered the head of the troops to come, and asked if Jesus was really dead already.
\v 45 After Pilate heard the report of the head of the troop, that Jesus had already died, he gave Joseph permission to take Jesus' body.
\v 46 Then Joseph bought white cloth to wrap Jesus' body in. And after Joseph and some people took His body down from the cross, they wrapped it in that cloth, and then carried His body and put it in a tomb that was dug like a cave into a rocky hill. After that, the door of the tomb was closed by rolling a large stone which had been prepared as a cover.
\v 47 While they took care of Jesus' body, the two Mary's were there, and saw the place where they put His body.
