\v 1-2 Dear Timothy, my Brother in the faith— you're really like my own son because you follow me in the same faith.
\p Greetings from Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus. I've been sent as an apostle because of the command of God— who's also our Savior. That command is also from Christ Jesus— who's our Hope.
\p My prayer is that God the Father and our Lord Christ Jesus will always be kind to you, have compassion on you, and watch over you so that you live calm under God’s protection!
\s Oppose the teachers of misleading teaching
\p
\v 3 When I went to Macedonia, I asked you to stay in Ephesus because there were some people there who had taught misleading teachings. So I asked you to tell them to stop teaching those things,
\v 4 and not let the church listen to teaching that's based on fables, or about lists of the forefathers of the people who taught it. Teaching like that is boring, because it's endless and only results in debates about things that can't be confirmed. And that kind of teaching doesn't lead the church to live with more faith in God.
\v 5 The purpose of my previous instruction was so that the church sincerely loves each other. That kind of love only exists if our hearts are cleansed by God and if we try to keep our consciences clean, as well as sincerely believing in the true teaching without pretending.
\v 6 But some people no longer live like that, and they just waste time with useless teaching.
\v 7 They want to become teachers of the Law, but they don't understand what they're saying— and even don't understand the things that they stress with complete self-confidence.
\p
\v 8 We know that the Law is good— as long as we teach the law according to its main purpose.
\v 9 For we know that the Law wasn't given to punish people whose lives are right. It was given to control people who like to break God’s commands, like to oppose God, don't know how to honor the Lord, commit sin, don't want to live holy, only think about worldly things, and kill people. There are even some who murder their own parents.
\v 10 And also, the Law was given to punish those who have sexual relations outside of marriage, or with the same sex. People who deserve to be punished also include people who sell slaves, all liars, and people who give false testimony about others, and everyone whose deeds oppose the true teaching.\f + \fr 1:10 \fk true teaching \ft Literally, “healthy teaching.” Healthy teaching is teaching that has proven to produce good things when it's followed, such as 1 Tim. 1:5,11. Teaching such as this guides us so that our way of life brings honor and glory to Christ, and also gives spiritual blessings. See also 1 Tim. 6:3; Tit. 1:9, 13; 2:1.\f*
\v 11 And that true teaching agrees with the Good News which God gave me to tell. God should be praised through the Good News that reflects His glory!
\s Thanks for God’s kindness
\p
\v 12 I'm thankful to our Lord Christ Jesus who always gives me strength. I'm also very thankful to Him who considers me faithful, so that He entrusted me with telling the Good News.
\v 13 However, I actually used to be one who insulted His name, and I liked to take harsh action while persecuting His followers. But Christ had compassion on me! For at that time I didn't yet believe in Him, so I didn't know if what I was doing was good or bad.
\v 14 Even so, the kindness of our Lord really overflowed to me so that I came to believe in Him and began to love my fellowman. That happened because I received Jesus, and became one with Him.
\p
\v 15 So the following teaching has proven true, and is worthy to be completely believed: Christ Jesus came to this world to save sinners, and of those sinners, my sin was the worst.
\v 16 It was precisely because of those sins of mine that I was shown mercy and forgiven, so that through me people can see the amazing patience of Christ Jesus. So Christ has shown His patience to me so that I would become an example to people who want to believe in Him and receive eternal life.
\v 17 For that reason, let's honor and glorify God forever! He's the King who rules forever, who can't be seen, and who'll never perish. He's the one and only God! Amen.
\p
\v 18 My son Timothy, I entrust this command to you— and remember that my motivation is in agreement with what was prophesied about you before you began your ministry: Fight well in this spiritual battle.
\v 19 Continue to believe completely in the true teaching, and take care that your conscience remains clean. For there are some people who've rejected living according to the leading of their consciences, so that they're no longer able to believe the true teaching.\f + \fr 1:19 \fk no longer able … \ft Literally, “destroyed their faith.” Paul used a figure of speech with the word 'destroyed', which illustrates faith as a ship, and it's as if the ship of their faith has crashed into something and is destroyed.\f*
\v 20 Two people like that are Hymenaeus and Alexander. I've handed them over to the devil.\f + \fr 1:20 \fk handed them over to the devil \ft Probably Paul's meaning is the same as what he commanded to the church in Corinth in 1 Cor. 5:4-5.\f* In that way, they can learn to stop insulting God.
