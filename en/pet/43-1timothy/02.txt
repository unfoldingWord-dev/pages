\s Motivation to pray
\p
\v 1 I advise you to teach these things to the church you serve: First of all, every member of the church should give all kinds of prayer requests to God for everyone else— accompanied by giving thanks.
\v 2 And pray for kings and all government authorities. Ask God that we may live in peace and quietness, and can be free to live according to God's will, in a way that's proper in everyone's sight.
\v 3 Every prayer like that is good and pleases the heart of God— who is our Savior.
\p
\v 4 And as our Savior, of course, God wants everyone to be saved and know the true teaching about Christ.
\v 5 For there's only one God, and only one Person who's the Mediator between God and man; He's Christ Jesus, who was also a man.
\v 6 He's the one who gave Himself as the payment to free each of us from sin. That event— which happened in the world at the proper time, is proof of God’s kindness towards man.
\v 7 Then I was chosen as an apostle to tell this Good News. In my testimony, I speak what's true and I don't lie. I was sent as a teacher to people who aren't Jews, so that they hear the true teaching and become believers.
\s Special teaching for men and women
\p
\v 8 So wherever brothers and sisters in the faith gather together, I want every man who leads in prayer to be a person without fault. By that I mean that the hands he lifts up to heaven\f + \fr 2:8 \fk Verse 8a \ft Literally, “So in every place, the men should pray by lifting up holy hands.” According to the custom of the Jews in Bible times, when the church prayed, they raised their hands toward heaven and also looked up. So what Paul wrote here wasn't a command that all men must raise their hands when they pray. What's important is that we don't pretend to be good, and the person who leads the church in prayer must live in a proper way— both before God and before everyone.\f* in prayer must not be soiled with sin, and he must not be an angry man who likes to quarrel.
\p
\v 9 I also want each woman to dress properly, being wise to choose clothes that are modest and neat. Don't enjoy displaying yourselves with fancy hair styles, or with too much gold jewelry, pearls,\f + \fr 2:9 \fk pearls \ft these are gemstones that are round, and often white in color. Pearls come from a type of mollusk, or pearl shell, formed because of some object or sand that has entered the body of the mollusk, and is then repeatedly covered by skin, so that it becomes big and round.\f* or expensive clothing.
\v 10 Instead, the proper way for each woman who claims to be a worshiper of God to beautify herself is to do good things.
\p
\v 11 In church meetings, each woman should be quiet so that she can hear what's taught and fully obey that teaching.
\v 12 I don't allow women to teach or rule over men. They must remain quiet while the church is being taught,
\v 13 because Adam was the one who was created first, then Eve.
\v 14 And Adam wasn't the who was deceived by the devil, but the woman was the one deceived, so that she became the first to commit sin.
\v 15 As a result of that sin, the female descendants of Eve fall under the punishment of God in having pain when giving birth.\x + Gen. 3:1-13\x* But even so, God is ready to help and save each woman— if she keeps fully believing in Him, does loving acts, and lives a holy and wise life.\f + \fr 2:15 \fk Verse 15 \ft This verse can also be translated, “Even so, God will make each woman safe when giving birth to children— as long as she keeps fully believing in Him, does loving acts, and lives a holy and wise life.”\f*
