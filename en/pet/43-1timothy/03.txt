\s Character traits needed to become an elder of the church
\p
\v 1 The following teaching has proven true: If a person desires to become an elder of the church, he desires a responsibility that is good.
\v 2 The one who's appointed as an elder must be a person whose life is blameless, he's faithful to his wife and he can't have more than one wife. The elder must also be a person who always controls himself, is wise, lives an orderly life, likes to provide lodging, and is able to teach other people well.
\v 3 Drunkards and people who like to fight can't be appointed as elders, because an elder has to be just, peace loving, and not love money.
\v 4 He has to be a person who knows how to manage his family well, and who trains his children so that they obey and respect him.
\v 5 Because if a person who wants to become an elder doesn't know how to manage his household, he certainly isn't able to lead God’s church.
\p
\v 6 A person who has only recently believed in Jesus must not be appointed as an elder because that could make him become arrogant, then the devil would use that arrogance to make him fall.
\v 7 An elder must also be known as a good person by people who aren't members of the church, so that the devil can't trap him through the words of other people who slander his name.
\s Character traits that are needed to become a church worker
\p
\v 8 In the same way, people who are appointed as workers in the church must be people who are respected, not two-faced, not drunkards, and not lovers of money.
\v 9 Every worker in the church must believe completely in the true teachings which God has revealed to us, and he must live with a clean conscience.
\v 10 And each candidate for church worker must be tested by being given a temporary service assignment. After proving that the candidate serves well, only then can he be appointed as a church worker.
\p
\v 11 In the same way, the wife of every church worker\f + \fr 3:11 \fk the wife of every church worker \ft Literally, “women/wives”. In this context, the word 'women/wives' can mean 'the wife of a church worker', or it can mean 'a woman who's appointed to be a church worker.'\f* must also be a respectable person, and not like to slander other people, is always self-controlled, and can be trusted in everything.
\p
\v 12 A man who serves as a church worker must be faithful to his wife, and can't have more than one wife. To be appointed as a worker in the church, he must be a person who can manage his children and his household well.
\v 13 Every church worker who serves well will be more and more respected, and because of that he'll be more and more confident to tell of his faith in Christ Jesus to other people.
\s The news of salvation which was revealed to us
\p
\v 14 Even though I hope to come to you soon, I feel it's wise to write these things to you now.
\v 15 But if I'm delayed in coming, through this letter you'll know how we ought to live as God's family. What I mean by God's family is the unity of all of the churches possessed by the living God. Of course as members of that unity, we're involved in supporting and maintaining the true teaching from God— like supporting pillars and foundation stones which make a house strong.
\v 16 It's really true that the true teaching which God has revealed to us is very amazing! For that reason, according to God's will, we completely believe that
\q1 Christ\f + \fr 3:16 \fk Christ \ft Literally, “The one who…” In some old Greek copies it's written as “God.”\f* came and lived in this world in a human body.
\q2 The Spirit of God proved that all He taught about Himself was true.
\q2 His entire life was witnessed by angels.
\q1 The people groups who aren't Jews have now heard the Good News about Him.
\q2 People in the whole world believe in Him.
\q2 And He was taken up to the place where He originally was with God in glory.
