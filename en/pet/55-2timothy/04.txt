\v 1 Remember that Christ Jesus will return and rule as King, then He'll judge everyone— both those who've died and those who are still living, so before God and Christ Jesus I give this command to you:
\v 2 Always preach God’s Word– whether or not the church you serve wants to hear it. Train them based on His Word, being patient with their various weaknesses. Point out their faults, rebuke them, and encourage their hearts.
\p
\v 3 For the time will come when people won't want to listen to true teaching anymore. Instead, they'll search here and there to find teachers who'll teach them about things that are pleasant to hear— according to the desires of their hearts.
\v 4 So they won't want to hear true teaching anymore, but they'll be happy to hear teaching based on fables or empty stories.
\p
\v 5 But you should restrain yourself all the time. Don't be afraid of facing troubles that happen because you serve the Lord. Do your task as a spokesman of the Good News. Fulfill all of your tasks as a servant of God.
\p
\v 6 For the time has come for me to be released from this worldly body! My blood will soon be poured out like an offering to the Lord,\f + \fr 4:6 \fk blood … \ft This phrase translates one word which can be translated “pour out wine as an offering.” Animal offerings made according to the Law were almost always completed with an offering of flour mixed with olive oil, and an offering of about two liters of wine— which was poured slowly on top of the meat sacrifice which was burning on the altar. See Ex. 29:38-41; Num. 15:1-12. Paul didn't mean that his blood would truly become a sacrifice. But in this way he illustrated that— for the Lord's glory, he would soon be killed in a horrible way. Compare Phil. 2:17.\f* then He'll receive my soul.
\v 7 I've already reached the finish line in this spiritual race. I've become the winner in this battle! I've stood firm in what I believe until the final day.
\v 8 So now the time has almost come for me to receive the victory crown which has been prepared for me. That crown will show that the just Judge— the Lord, acknowledges me as a person who has lived right. I long for that day of victory when I meet Him and receive that crown. And the crown of victory isn't prepared just for me, but also for everyone who longs for the day of His return.
\s Personal instructions
\p
\v 9 Try to come to me as soon as possible,
\v 10 because Demas— who loves this world too much, has left me and gone to Thessalonica. Whereas I've sent Crescens to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia.
\v 11 Only Luke is still with me. When you come, invite Mark to come with you, because he has become a good helper for me.
\v 12 And also Tychicus, I've sent him to Ephesus.
\p
\v 13 When you go through Troas, get the thick robe which I left with Carpus, and also my books— especially the ones made of animal skins.
\p
\v 14 Alexander— that copper and iron smith, has done even more to really persecute me, so that the troubles for me have increased. The Lord will punish him according to his actions.
\v 15 You should also watch out for him, because he truly opposes our teaching.
\p
\v 16 The first time I defended myself in court, there wasn't even one friend that helped me. They had all left me. May God forgive them.
\v 17 But at that time, the Lord was still with me. And He gave me strength, so I could preach the Good News fully to those present— who were all non-Jews. So in the end I was saved from the lion’s mouth.
\v 18 The Lord is the one who is able to save me from any threat, and in the end He'll bring me safely into His kingdom in heaven. To Him be glory forever. Amen!
\s Final greetings
\p
\v 19 Give my greetings to Priscilla and Aquila, and to the family of Onesiphorus.
\v 20 On the way here, Erastus decided to stay in Corinth. And I left Trophimus in Miletus because he was sick.
\v 21 Try as hard as possible to come here before winter.
\p Eubulus and also Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all of the brothers and sisters in the faith here send you greetings.
\p
\v 22 Timothy, my prayer is that the Lord will always be with you. And to all who read this letter, I pray that the kindness of God will always be with each of you.
