\v 1-2 Dear Timothy, my beloved son:
\p Greetings from Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus. I was sent as an apostle to tell about the eternal life that God promised, because of His will. We obtain that eternal life because we're one with Christ Jesus.
\p My prayer is that God the Father and our Lord Christ Jesus will always be kind to you, have compassion on you, and watch over you so that you live calmly in God’s protection!
\s Expressions of thanks and encouragement
\p
\v 3 Timothy, because of you I'm very thankful to God— the One I serve with a heart that doesn't feel any guilt, like my forefathers. I don't forget to pray for you day and night.
\v 4 And when I remember you, I also remember your tears when we parted. So I really long to see you, so that my heart is filled with joy again.
\v 5 I remember that you sincerely believe in Christ. That has been well-proven to me. And in that trait, you follow the example of your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice.
\v 6 For that reason, I want to remind you to keep using and increasing the spiritual ability that God gave you when I laid my hands on you. That ability is like a fire that can't be allowed to die, but has to be kept aflame.
\v 7 For when God's Spirit leads our lives, we don't need to be afraid or ashamed. Instead, the Spirit increases our ability to live with power, full of love and self-control.
\p
\v 8 So don't be ashamed to give a testimony about our Lord, and don't be ashamed because of me— imprisoned because of serving Him. Instead, with the strength of God, you also suffer with me for the sake of the Good News.
\v 9 For God has chosen us and saved us to become the people He has made holy. All that did not happen because of what we've done. Only because of God's will and only through His kindness are we saved and called. And that kindness of His was planned for us before the beginning of the age and given because we are made one with Christ Jesus.
\v 10 That salvation has now been revealed to us by the coming of Christ Jesus, our Savior. He has destroyed the power of death over us, and through the Good News He reveals the way towards life that is eternal, and has no end.
\v 11 In order for the Good News to be spread more and more widely, God chose me as a spokesman, an apostle and a teacher.
\v 12 That's why I'm suffering in this prison! But I'm not ashamed, because I already know Jesus. He's very worthy to be believed, and I'm sure that He's able to guard and guarantee the results of the ministry that He has entrusted to me– until the Day of His coming.
\p
\v 13 Hold firmly to the true teaching that I taught you. Keep believing in Christ, and live with the love we obtain because of being one with Him.
\v 14 For now God has entrusted my teaching and service to you. Guard it with the help of the Holy Spirit who lives in us.
\p
\v 15 You've heard that all of the brothers in the faith in the region of Asia have left me, including Phygelus and Hermogenes.
\v 16-17 That makes me miss Onesiphorus!\f + \fr 1:16 \fk Onesiphorus \ft Paul doesn't directly say that Onesiphorus is dead, but many commentators say that the language used by Paul was more fitting if Onesiphorus had died and no longer lived with his family.\f* I pray that the Lord blesses Onesiphorus' family according to His kindness. Even though I was in prison, he wasn't ashamed to visit me. In fact, when he came to Rome, he had to search for me everywhere until he found me. He always encouraged and strengthened me.
\v 18 And of course you remember how much he helped me in Ephesus. May the Lord be very kind to Onesiphorus on the Judgment Day!
