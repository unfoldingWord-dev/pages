As the boys grew up, Rebekah loved Jacob, but Isaac loved Esau. Jacob loved to stay at home, but Esau loved to hunt.

One day, when Esau came back from hunting, he was very hungry. Esau said to Jacob, “Please give me some of the food you have made.” Jacob responded, “First, give me your rights as the oldest son.” So Esau gave Jacob his rights as the oldest son. Then Jacob gave him some food.

When Isaac was old, he wanted to give his blessing to Esau. But before he did, Rebekah and Jacob tricked him by having Jacob pretend to be Esau. Jacob put on Esau’s clothes and put goat skins on his neck and hands.

Isaac could not see well. Jacob came to Isaac and said, “I am Esau, I have come to receive your blessing.” When Isaac felt the goat hair and smelled the clothes, he thought it was Esau and blessed him.

Esau hated Jacob because Jacob had stolen his rights as oldest son and also his blessing. So he planned to kill Jacob after their father died.

But Rebekah heard of Esau’s plan. So she arranged for Jacob to be sent far away to live with her relatives.

While Jacob was there, he married four women who gave birth to a total of twelve sons and a daughter. God made him very wealthy.

After twenty years away from his home in Canaan, Jacob returned there with his family, his servants, and all his herds of animals.

He was very afraid because he thought Esau still wanted to kill him. So he sent Esau many herds of animals as a gift. The servants who brought the animals said to Esau, “These animals are a gift from your servant, Jacob. He is coming soon.”

But Esau had already forgiven Jacob, and they were happily reunited. Jacob then lived peacefully in Canaan. Then Isaac died, and Jacob and Esau buried him. The covenant promises God had promised to Abraham and then to Isaac now passed on to Jacob.
