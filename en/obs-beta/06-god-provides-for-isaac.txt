When Abraham had grown to be very old and Isaac was a man, Abraham sent one of his servants back to the land where his relatives lived to find a wife for his son, Isaac.

After a very long journey, God led the servant to Rebekah, who was the granddaughter of Abraham’s brother.

She agreed to leave her family and go back with the servant. Isaac married her as soon as she arrived.

After a long time, Abraham died and all of the promises that God had made to him in the covenant were passed on to Isaac. God had promised that Isaac would have countless descendants, but Isaac’s wife, Rebekah, could not have children.

Isaac prayed for Rebekah, and God allowed her to get pregnant with twins. The two children struggled with each other, so Rebekah asked God what was happening.

God told Rebekah, "There are two nations inside of you. They will struggle with each other and the older son will serve the younger one."

When they were born, the older son came out red and hairy—they named him Esau. The younger son had smooth skin, and they named him Jacob.
