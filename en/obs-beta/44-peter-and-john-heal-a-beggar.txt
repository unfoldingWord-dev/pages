One day Peter and John went to the Temple. On their way, they saw a crippled man begging for money.

Peter looked at him and said, “I do not have any money to give you. But what I have I will give you. In the name of Jesus, get up and walk!”

The man was immediately healed, and he began walking and jumping around, praising God. The people in the Temple were amazed.

A crowd quickly formed. Peter said to them, “Why are you amazed that this man is healed? It was not through our own power or goodness that he was healed, but by faith in the name of Jesus.”

“You asked that Jesus be killed. You killed the Author of Life, but God raised him from the dead. This is how God fulfilled the prophecies that the Messiah would suffer and die. But now, repent and turn to God so that your sins will be washed away.”

The leaders of the Temple were greatly annoyed at what Peter and John were saying. So they arrested them and threw them into prison. But many of the people believed what they had seen and heard and the Church grew to 5,000 men, plus women and children.

The next day, the Jewish leaders brought Peter and John before the high priest and his family. They asked them, “By what power did you do this?”

{{:en:obs:obs-44-08.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

Peter responded, “It is by the name of Jesus the Messiah. You crucified him, but God raised him to life again! You rejected him, but there is no other way to be saved except through the name of Jesus!”

The leaders were shocked because they could see that these men were common men who were not well-educated. They also realized that these men had been with Jesus. After they had threatened Peter and John, they let them go.
