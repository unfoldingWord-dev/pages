\v 1 Then Jesus said to them, “What I'm saying is true: Some of you people who are here won't die before they see God begin to set up His kingdom with power in this world.”\f + \fr 9:1 \fk verse 1 \ft When Jesus healed sick people, it showed that God's kingdom had defeated diseases, demons, and even death. God's kingdom was also revealed at the time His disciples saw Jesus on the mountain with the glory of heaven (Mark 9:2-13). In fact, the moment Jesus died, the Roman officer acknowledged that He was God's Son, and this meant that Jesus deserved to rule. (Mark 15:39). And Jesus' resurrection from death, (Mark 16:6, 19), very clearly showed that God's kingdom already had power in this world. Things like that showed that a new government had visibly begun on this earth.\f*
\s Jesus appears radiant on the mountain
\r (Mat. 17:1-13; Luke 9:28-36)
\p
\v 2 After six days had passed, Jesus invited Peter, James and John to climb a high mountain, to be alone together. Then the three of them saw Jesus' body and His clothes change.
\v 3 His clothes became very white and shiny. No one in the whole world can make cloth as white as that.
\v 4 Suddenly the three disciples saw the Prophet Elijah and Moses speaking with Jesus.
\p
\v 5 Then Peter said to Jesus, “Wow, Teacher, it's so wonderful that we're here! We'll make three huts here— one for You, one for Moses, and one more for Elijah.”
\v 6 Peter spoke like that because he didn't know what was proper to say, since he and the other two disciples were very frightened.
\p
\v 7 But at that very moment, a cloud descended and covered them. Then there was a voice from the cloud which said, “This is My Son, whom I love very much. Listen closely to Him.”
\v 8 Suddenly, they didn't see anyone else with them— except Jesus.
\p
\v 9 While they were going back down the mountain, Jesus forbid them, “Don't tell anyone what you saw on top of this mountain until the I the Son of Man come back to life from death.”
\v 10 They obeyed what Jesus commanded them, but then they kept asking each other what Jesus meant by “come back to life from death.”
\p
\v 11 That same day, they asked Jesus, “Why do the Law experts teach that the Prophet Elijah must come before the King of Salvation comes?”\f + \fr 9:11 \fk the Prophet Elijah must come ... \ft This teaching comes from Mal. 3:1, 4:5-6.\f*
\p
\v 12 Jesus answered, “That's true, Elijah has to come earlier, to prepare everything before the Son of Man comes. But it's also written in God's Word, ‘The Son of Man has been apppointed to suffer much, and be insulted by people.’
\v 13 But I'm telling you that Elijah has already come\f + \fr 9:13 \fk Elijah has already come \ft Mat. 17:13 explains, “Only then did the disciples understand that He was talking about John the Baptist, who replaced the Prophet Elijah.” See also Mark 1:6.\f* before Me, but people did many evil things to him according to their desires. That's also in agreement with what's written about him in God's Word.”
\s Jesus drives an evil spirit out of a boy
\r (Mat.17:14-21, Luke 9:37-43)
\p
\v 14 When Jesus and His three disciples returned, they saw many people surrounding Jesus' other disciples. And there were also Law experts there, who were arguing with His disciples.
\v 15 But when the crowd saw Jesus, they were very startled and ran to welcome Him.
\p
\v 16 Then Jesus asked, “What were you arguing about?”
\p
\v 17 There was a father among the crowd, who answered, “Teacher, I came because I wanted to bring my child to You, Sir. There's an evil spirit that controls him, so that he can't talk.
\v 18 When the evil spirit attacks him, it throws him around, foam comes out of his mouth, he grinds his teeth, and his body becomes rigid. I've asked Your disciples to drive the spirit out, but they can't do it.”
\p
\v 19 Then Jesus said to them, “That's too much! You who live in this age don't believe in God! How long do I have to be patient with you! Haven't I been with you long enough! Bring the child here!”
\p
\v 20 So they brought the child to Him. But the moment the evil spirit saw Jesus, it attacked the child and shook him. And the child fell to the ground, rolled around, and foam came out of his mouth.
\p
\v 21 Jesus asked the child's father, “How long has he been like this?”
\p Then the father answered, “Since he was still small.
\v 22 The evil spirit has often thrown him into fire and pushed him under water, because the spirit wants to kill him, of course. But if You can do something, Sir, have compassion on us and help us.”
\p
\v 23 But Jesus reprimanded him. “Why do you say, ‘If You can!’ Everything is possible— if you believe in Me.”
\p
\v 24 The child's father immediately cried out, “I believe! Help me to believe even more!”
\p
\v 25 When Jesus saw that the number of people was quickly growing greater, He commanded the evil spirit, “Hey, you spirit that's making this child deaf and mute, I command you: Come out of him, and don't enter him again.”
\p
\v 26 The evil spirit cried out, and shook the child hard, then it came out of him. The child looked like he was dead, so the crowd who witnessed it said, “He's dead.”
\v 27 But Jesus took the child's hand and helped him stand up.
\p
\v 28 When Jesus and His disciples were alone in a house, they asked Him, “Why couldn't we drive out that evil spirit?”
\p
\v 29 Then Jesus answered, “An evil spirit of this kind can only be driven out by praying.”
\s Jesus tells His disciples that He'll be killed
\r (Mat. 17:22-23; Luke 9:43b-45)
\p
\v 30 Then Jesus and His disciples went away from that place through the region of Galilee, to the city of Capernaum. Jesus didn't want other people to know where they were,
\v 31 because He was teaching His disciples like this, “The Son of Man— who I am, will be turned over to the hands of evil people, and will be killed. But on the third day after I die, I'll live again.”
\v 32 At that time, His disciples didn't understand what Jesus taught, but they were reluctant to ask Him about it.
\s The character of the people who'll be most important in God's kingdom
\r (Mat. 18:1-9; Luke 9:46-50, 17:1-2)
\p
\v 33 Then Jesus and His disciples reached Capernaum. When they were in the house, Jesus asked, “What problem were you discussing on the way earlier?”
\v 34 But they just kept quiet, because on the way they were discussing which of them was number one.
\v 35 Jesus sat down and called to His disciples, then He told them, “If you want to become number one in God's eyes, you must be ready to become the very last one, and be ready to serve everyone too.”
\p
\v 36 Then Jesus invited a little child, and put the child in between them. While hugging the child He said,
\v 37 “If you receive and serve\f + \fr 9:37 \fk receive and serve \ft Literally, “receive.” In the Greek language, the basic meaning of that word is to receive a guest into your house that you don't yet know.\f* a little child like this for the purpose of glorifying My name, you've received and served Me. And if you've served Me, it isn't just Me that you've served, but you've also served God who sent Me into the world.”
\p
\v 38 Then John said to Jesus, “Teacher, we saw a person who drove out demons by using Your name, so we forbid him, because he isn't part of our group.”
\p
\v 39 Then Jesus said, “Don't forbid him, because a person who does miracles using My name can't immediately turn and insult Me.
\v 40 For people who don't oppose us belong to our group.
\v 41 What I'm saying is true: If a person gives just a cup of water to drink to one of you, because the one being served is a follower of Christ, that person will surely receive a reward from God for that deed.”
\p
\v 42 Then Jesus said again, “If someone influences a little child who believes in Me to sin, that person will receive a very harsh punishment from God. Before he commits that great of a sin, it would be better if a large stone\f + \fr 9:42 \fk large stone \ft Literally, “a donkey's grinding stone.” This was a large stone that was turned by using the strength of a donkey, to grind grains of wheat, to make flour.\f* were tied around his neck and he was then thrown into the sea. That trouble would be far lighter than punishment from God for that great of a sin.”
\s Becoming a citizen of God's kingdom isn't easy
\p
\v 43-44 Then Jesus said again, “If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off and just throw your hand away! Don't let your hand make you fail to receive eternal life in heaven. It's better for you to enter heaven with just one hand, than to have a complete hand, but go to hell— where the fire never goes out.\f + \fr {9:43-44} \fk Difference in copies \ft There were some copies in earlier times that repeated verse 48 here, and after verse 45. After a long time, those two additions were considered to be verses 44 and 46.\f*
\v 45-46 It's the same if one of your feet causes you to sin. Just cut off your foot! Don't let your foot make you fail to receive eternal life in heaven. It's better to enter heaven with a lame foot than to have a complete foot, but be thrown into hell.
\v 47 And if one of your eyes causes you to sin, dig it out and throw that eye away! It's better for you to enter God's kingdom with just one eye, than to have a complete eye, but be thrown into the fire of hell.
\v 48 As it's written in God's word, ‘In hell, the worms that eat people will never die, and the fire there will never go out.’
\p
\v 49 “Actually everyone will be tested with trouble that feels like the heat of a fire.\f + \fr 9:49 \fk Verse 49 \ft Literally in the Greek language this verse says, “For everyone will be salted with fire.”\f*
\v 50 “You who follow Me are like salt. Salt is used to make food taste better, but if its salty taste disappears, that salt isn't useful at all. Don't be like salt that has lost its salty taste! May you be useful and live in peace with each other.”\x + See Mat.5:13-16, Luke 14:34-35.\x*
