\s The parable about seeds that were scattered
\r (Mat. 13:1-9; Luke 8:4-8)
\p
\v 1 Another time, when Jesus was teaching by the shore of Lake Galilee, a large crowd gathered around Him. So He got into a boat anchored there and sat down in it, while the crowd still stood on the shore.
\v 2 Then Jesus taught them many things using different parables— like the following:
\p
\v 3 He said, “Listen closely! One day a farmer went to scatter seed in a field.
\v 4 When he scattered the seed, some of it fell on the road, and the birds came and ate those seeds until they were all gone.
\v 5 Some also fell on rocky ground, and the sprouts from those seeds came up quickly, because of the thin layer of soil.
\v 6 When the sun got hot, the sprouts withered and dried up, because their roots couldn't go down deep into the soil.
\v 7 There were also some seeds that fell among thorny weeds, but those weeds grew bigger and prevented the shoots from growing, so in the end they didn't produce anything.
\v 8 But some also fell on fertile soil. Those seeds sprouted, grew big, and produced a lot of grain. There were some stalks that produced thirty grains, some produced sixty grains, and there were even some that produced a hundred grains.”
\v 9 Then Jesus said to them, “You have ears— don't you!? So listen closely!”
\s The reason Jesus taught by using parables
\r (Mat. 13:10-17, Luke 8:9-10)
\p
\v 10 When Jesus was alone, His disciples and some people who heard that parable came to Him and said, “We still don’t understand the meaning of that last parable.”
\p
\v 11 Then He said to them, “In the past, mankind was not allowed to understand the teachings about God's kingdom.\f + \fr 4:11 \fk God's kingdom \ft is the 'rule of God' over everyone who obeys Him. Just as Jesus obeyed God's will to the point of surrendering Himself as a sacrificial offering, so each of God's people has to surrender himself to follow His desires too. (Mark 8:34; Rom. 10:9-10, 12:1-2) In that way, we prove that we've become citizens of God's kingdom and are worthy to receive all that God has promised to His chosen people from the beginning. When Jesus returns, God will rule visibly on this earth— just like He always rules in heaven. (Dan. 7:13-14, Mat. 6:10)\f* But now you have been given permission to understand those secret things. But I always teach others those things through parables.
\v 12 For God wants what the prophet wrote to come true, when God said,
\q1 ‘Even though these people see many miracles,
\q2 they won't realize what's happening.
\q1 And even though they continually hear teachings,
\q2 they won't understand them.
\q1 Don't let them repent and return to Me,
\q2 so that I forgive them!”\x + Is. 6:9-10\x*
\s Jesus explains the parable of the scattered seed
\r (Mat. 13:18-23, Luke 8:11-15)
\p
\v 13 Then Jesus said to them, “How could you not understand the meaning of that parable?! When I teach you some other time again with a parable like that, you still won't understand.”
\v 14 Then Jesus explained the parable saying, 
\m“The person who scattered the seed is like a person who spreads teachings from God.
\m
\v 15 The seeds that fell on the road are like people who've just heard teaching from God, but the devil comes and steals that teaching from their hearts.
\m
\v 16 And the seeds that fell on the rocky ground are like people who hear God's teaching and immediately receive it gladly.
\v 17 But the teaching can't take root in their hearts and doesn't last long. When they experience trouble or persecution because of following the teaching, they'll quickly abandon the Lord.
\m
\v 18 In the same way, the seeds that fell among thorny grass are like people who've heard teaching from God,
\v 19 but they worry about the basic needs of living in this world, and they're influenced because they want to become rich. So they're busy searching for all the various things they want. All of those desires are like thorny grass that hinders the teaching so that it isn't productive in their lives.
\m
\v 20 And the seeds that fell on fertile ground are like people who hear teaching from God and accept it wholeheartedly. Like the fertile soil, they produce much fruit\f + \fr 4:20 \fk produce much fruit \ft In other parts of God's word, we can see how people can 'produce fruit'. First, God's good news enables people to believe. We also see that a person can 'produce fruit' by faithfully doing what God commands in his life. (Mat. 5-7) We also 'produce fruit' if the words that come out of our mouths are good in God's eyes. (Mat. 12:31-37) And we also 'produce fruit' if we lead other people to repent. (John 15:16) A life like that is considered to be good fruit in God's eyes.\f*— like a plant that produces thirty, or sixty, or even a hundred grains."
\s We have to understand Jesus' teachings
\r (Mat. 13:12, Luke 8:16-18)
\p
\v 21 Then Jesus said to them again, “A person wouldn't possibly put a lamp that's lit under a pail! You wouldn't possibly put it under a bed either. But a lamp is always put in a high place so that it can give light in the house.
\v 22 It's the same with all the lessons that I teach to the crowds through parables too: The meaning is kept hidden now, but later on everything will be out in the open. What isn't clear now will become clear later on.
\v 23 Then Jesus said to them, “You have ears— don't you! So listen closely!”
\p
\v 24 Then Jesus said to them again, “Each of you must keep what I'm teaching you closely in your hearts, because as you try to understand My teaching, God will also increase your ability to understand it. In fact, He'll add even more wisdom.
\v 25 So to the person who has the ability to understand My teaching, God will increase that ability even more, but for people who don't try to remember and understand My teaching, God will take that ability away from them.
\s Two parables about the growth of God's kingdom in the world
\r (Mat. 13:31-32, 34, Luke 13:18-19)
\p
\v 26 Then Jesus gave them another parable, “God's kingdom is like a farmer who scatters wheat seeds in his field.
\v 27 After scattering the seeds, he goes on and lives life as usual. He lives day and night without worrying about those seeds. The seeds sprout on their own and keep growing, but the farmer doesn't understand how those seeds can grow.
\v 28 Without the farmer's help, the wheat seeds that were scattered on the ground will grow on their own and produce fruit. First the seeds sprout, then small grass-like stalks will grow. And the stalks will grow bigger, and then the heads will grow, which will finally become full of grains.
\v 29 But when the crop is ripe, the farmer will know that it's time to harvest it, and he'll quickly take a scythe and cut it down.
\s God's kingdom is like a mustard seed
\r (Mat. 13:31-32, 34, Luke 13:18-19)
\p
\v 30 Then Jesus said to them again, “To make it even clearer, I'll give you another parable to illustrate God's kingdom to you.
\v 31 God's kingdom is like a mustard seed.\f + \fr 4:31 \fk a mustard seed \ft The mustard plant that grows in Israel isn't the same as what grows in Indonesia. The mustard plant in Indonesia doesn't “become big like a tree” and birds can't “make nests in its branches.” What's most important in this parable is that something which started out very small can grow until it becomes very large, and that's the same as God's kingdom.\f* Even though it's the smallest seed in the world,
\v 32 yet when it's planted, it'll become the biggest plant in the garden. The plant will grow large branches, so that birds can make nests and take shelter there.”
\p
\v 33 Jesus used many parables like that to teach them, because in that way they were able to understand.
\v 34 He always used parables to teach the crowds, but when Jesus was alone with His disciples, He explained the meaning of everything that was illustrated in the parables.
\s Jesus stops a storm
\r (Mat. 8:23-27, Luke 8:22-25)
\p
\v 35 That same day, when it was almost night, Jesus said to His disciples, “Let's go to the other side of the lake.”
\v 36 So they went and left the crowd behind, using the boat that Jesus had used for teaching. There were other boats that followed them too.
\v 37 Suddenly a strong wind and big waves came and beat against the boat, so the boat rocked and water entered until it was almost full.
\v 38 At that time, Jesus was sleeping in the back of the boat with His head on a pillow. Then His disciples woke Him up and said, “Teacher, why don't you care?! We're going to sink soon and be destroyed!”
\p
\v 39 Then Jesus woke up and commanded the wind and the lake, “Stop, and be quiet!” At that very moment, the strong wind stopped and the lake became very calm.
\v 40 Then He said to them, “Why do you get frightened so easily? It's clear now that you don't yet believe in Me!”
\p
\v 41 Then they became really afraid of Him and respected Him, and then said to each other, “Wow, what kind of man is this?!\f + \fr 4:41 \fk Wow, what kind of a man is this?!\ft Literally, “Who is this man..” That wasn't a question to ask His name, but the meaning is like the way it is translated— which is the same as that written by Matthew in Mat. 8:27. In this verse, the pronoun used to replace Jesus' name begins with a small letter, because the ones speaking aren't people who believe that He's the Son of God.\f* Even the wind and the lake obey his command.”
