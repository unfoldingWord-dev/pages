==== USFMTag ====

USFM is an easy way to mark a plain-text file as a translation of the Bible (example: ''\v1 This is the first verse'', ''\v2 this is the second verse''). The **[[en:dev:usfmtag|USFMTag]]** project enables Bible translations that are marked up with this simple formatting to automatically display as beautiful web pages in Door43.
