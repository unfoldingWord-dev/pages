====== Door43 Development ======

These are the projects under development (or hoped for) to help improve & extend Door43.


==== Open Bible Stories, the App ====

Open Bible Stories wants to be a picture flipboard with the text of each segment overlayed over the picture and all of it wrapped in a mobile app. We have a proof-of-concept Android app that can be used as a starting point. More on this project **[[en:dev:obs-app|here]]**.


==== USFMTag ====

USFM is an easy way to mark a plain-text file as a translation of the Bible (example: ''\v1 This is the first verse'', ''\v2 this is the second verse''). The **[[en:dev:usfmtag|USFMTag]]** project enables Bible translations that are marked up with this simple formatting to automatically display as beautiful web pages in Door43.

==== Other Projects ====

  * Open Bible Stories video render system – currently in development by [[http://missionaldigerati.org|Missional Digerati]].
  * Door43 Content Export Utilities – a set of profiles and scripts that function as a "render engine" to convert content in Door43 into various formats for offline use, e.g. PDF, EPUB, DOC, HTML, Mobile apps, etc.
