====== Door43 Development ======

These are the projects under development (or hoped for) to help improve & extend Door43.


===== Open Bible Stories, the App =====

//Open Bible Stories wants to be a picture flipboard with the text of each segment overlayed over the picture and all of it wrapped in a mobile app. We have a proof-of-concept Android app, built using [[http://phonegap.com|PhoneGap]], that can be used as a starting point. We are also developing native applications for Android and iOS.//

===== USFMTag =====

//USFM is an easy way to mark a plain-text file as a translation of the Bible (example: ''\v1 This is the first verse'', ''\v2 this is the second verse''). The USFMTag project enables Bible translations that are marked up with this simple formatting to automatically display as beautiful web pages in Door43.//

===== Tools (Export Utilities) =====

//Door43 Tools are an extensible set of profiles and utilities (e.g. scripts) that function as a "render engine" to convert and export content in Door43 into various formats for offline use, e.g. PDF, EPUB, DOC, HTML, Mobile apps, etc.//

===== Map Creator (for Open Bible Maps) =====

//What if you had no concept of where Israel is, or Rome, or Egypt, or Galilee, or any of the other places mentioned in the Bible? Imagine how difficult it would be to accurately understand the Bible and the history of Israel. **Open Bible Maps** makes it possible to rapidly translate high-quality maps of the Bible in any language.//
