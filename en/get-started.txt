====== How to Get Started ======

Translating content in Door43 is easy! Follow these simple steps to get started:

===== 1. Create an Account & Log in to Door43 =====

To start translating content, you will need a user account on Door43. If you do not have an account, [[en:get-started?do=register|create one]] then you can [[en:get-started?do=login|login]].

===== 2. Edit a (Test) Page =====

Door43 has a [[playground:playground|test page]] that you can freely edit to try things out. 

**Graphical Editor** – When you click the "Edit this page" button, you will probably see an edit window that looks like a simplified word processor. The buttons take care of formatting text and generally make it easier to use.

**Lightweight Editor** – If you prefer, you can click the "DW Edit" button beneath the edit box to switch to a very lightweight, text-based editor. This is the standard DokuWiki editor and it provides full control over the syntax of the text. //Note: when using the lightweight editor, you can switch back to the graphical editor by clicking the "FCK Edit" button.//

===== 3. Choose a Resource =====

Browse to a resource you would like to translate. For instance, to translate the first story of [[en:obs|Open Bible Stories]], you would click [[en:obs:01-the-creation|1. The Creation]].

===== 4. Choose a Language =====

In the sidebar, you should see a language selection dropdown. When you click it, you will see a list of available languages, sorted by [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639|language code]]. If you see the language into which you would like to translate, click it.((If you need a language added to Door43, please [[http://distantshoresmedia/contact|contact us]].))

**Source Text** – If the language you select does not have a source text already available on the page, you will see a header on the page that says "This page does not exist yet". You can save some time by starting with a source text from another language. Here's how:

  - Click the back button in your browser to return to the same page in the previous language.
  - Click the "Edit this page" button (or "View the page source").
  - Select all the text in the editing window.
  - Copy the text (Control-C).
  - Click the "Cancel" button to leave the edit box and return to the page view.
  - Choose your desired language in the language selection dropdown.
  - Click "Create this page".
  - Paste the contents of the original page into the edit box.

===== 5. Start Translating =====

Simply begin translating the source text into the language you selected.
