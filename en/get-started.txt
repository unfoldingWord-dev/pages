The video assumes you understand the above instructions. The video uses the graphical editor. Here is a summary of the process:


    * Find stories in your heart language that have not been translated that you want to work on.
    * Open the Translation Notes in a new window and arrange the windows side-by-side.
    * Have both the [[:en:obs-training:01|Translation Notes]] and the Heart Language windows on the same story.
    * In the Translation Notes window note the Picture or Frame Number (number in [ ] after the story title).
    * Open the graphical (FCK Edit) editor in the heart language window and scroll down to the desired frame. Compare the picture .
    * Read the Notes for help on how to translate some of the words and terms.


**Once you have chosen the correct words or terms in your language, arrange the translated words so they make sense and the stories are easy to read and understand.** 


    * Continue editing frames and saving your work.
    * Enjoy and share the new translation.
