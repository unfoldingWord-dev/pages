=====Change "Israeli(s)" to "Israelite(s)"=====


Will using the word Israeli(s) create undesirable confusion or political statements?


Israeli only refers to modern day citizens of Israel from 1947 to today. Israelite is the correct term for the Hebrew people before 586 BC. After 586 BC Jew is the correct term to refer to the religious and ethnic group.
