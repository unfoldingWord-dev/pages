Introduction to Hermeneutics and Exegesis.


    - Definition of the terms
	      - Hermeneutics and exegesis are related terms. They can sometimes be confused or used in the same sense, depending on the scholar who is writing about these words that are central within  the world of biblical interpretation and translation.
		        - Every interpreter or translator should know something about the language in which the Bible was written. The languages of the Bible are: Hebrew, Aramaic, for the Old Testament and Koine or “common” Greek, for the New Testament.
			          - For many years, those who interpreted or translated the Bible had to learn the ancient languages of the Bible. They would then make application of what they learned and write about or teach what they’d learned. You can see that this may take a long time for a person to become proficient in the Biblical languages, to the point where they could teach effectively, or translate accurately.
          - The result of this approach may be a more accurate translation, but it required a great effort and many years to create a translation of a New Testament, or to become proficient in the content and meaning of the text so that it may be taught correctly. 
          - The value of this approach is that there is a high degree of certainty that the target language will reflect the meaning and content of the language of the Bible that is being translated, when that work of translation work is done faithfully by a team of trained translators who have studied both the target and the source languages extensively and make every effort to create an accurate, natural, and clearly understood translation.
        - Another approach would be for an interpreter to take resources and commentaries, and to teach what they have been taught by others. Translators would take a languages they knew and then bring them into a new target language (with which they were familiar), trusting the accuracy of the source text (perhaps a well-known English version) for the basis of the new translation.  This process of taking a common language source of the Bible and translating it into a new target language is often referred to as “accelerated Bible translation.”
      - Hermeneutics is the science of interpretation. It is the set of technical and linguistic skills used first establish the text of the Bible from manuscripts, and then to understand the text of the original language, the ideas, terms, vocabulary, lexicography and accidence (or the forms), grammar (syntax) of both the source (the original text that is being translated) and the target language (the language into which the Bible is being translated), so that it is possible to create a new translation that is accurate to the original, representative of the political and religious conditions, and being familiar with customs and the mundane elements of daily life in both the source and the target languages, so that the source text can be translated in a way that is faithful to the original. It would be clear in its presentation and natural in the use of the target language. Those who read the target translation would understand the message of the original text of scripture.
		        - The first step of translation is to establish the best text of the original language (Greek for the New Testament; Hebrew and Aramaic, for the Old Testament). Textual criticism is the scholarly study of existing manuscripts of the scriptures. Its purpose is to identify the most accurate texts, accumulated from a variety of sources (papyri manuscripts, vellum manuscripts, ancient commentaries and lectionaries (daily readings of the Bible), and sermons and books of church life and the rules of community (like //The Didache//  or //The Teaching//) and to identify the most accurate and faithful text of scripture that we can ascertain.
        - Textual criticism is a complex and difficult discipline, if for no other reason, because of the sheer number of manuscripts that must be sorted and compared, analyzed and grouped (over 50,000 – if the lectionaries and allusions in ancient documents are counted – with more than 800,000 disputed readings (which we note later, most of which are simple variations in spelling, as in place or person names being spelled variously, and very few with any impact on questions of faith or life); and somewhat more than 5,000 New Testament manuscripts in all). With this large number of witnesses (the name for the various readings) it is necessary to develop a set of rules and processes by which these “witnesses” across these families of manuscripts can be evaluated fairly as their faithfulness to the text written by the author of the book of scripture, or to identify the “witness” as a later addition or omission, indicating a change from the original text, as best as we can determine it.
        - Textual criticism, as a science, has a set of principles by which each reading (witness) may be evaluated.
			          - Some minority readings may be reviewed and identified bearing the marks of authenticity. Some may be rejected because of their appearance in the family of reading hundreds of years after a strongly defended family of texts has offered strong reasons for rejecting an addition hundreds of years after the better manuscripts were written.
          - Mistakes and lapses are identified and ranked by an editorial committee according to the likelihood that a reading is the best representation of the original (as it is being reconstructed from many manuscripts) or if there were a mistake or corruption of the text in a particular manuscript or family of manuscripts.
        - Textual criticism has made great progress with the recent discovery of new ancient manuscripts and many previous difficulties have been illuminated by these discoveries. But other difficulties have remained.  
			          - Most texts on hermeneutics have an introduction to textual criticism.
          - Bruce Metzger’s, //A Textual Commentary on the Greek New Testament//, is one of the widely circulated commentaries that just deals with the manuscript evidence and variant-readings of the manuscripts, and the reasons for including or excluding those readings, in the text of the New Testament. Other technical commentaries on specific New Testament Books, offer thorough analysis the Greek text for those books, and can provide an introduction to the expansive field of the study of textual criticism.
        - Textual criticism is finding and removing errors from transcription (copying) and correcting mistakes than may have occurred using the best evidence possible.
			          - Understanding the methods of copying, scribal practices and propensities to errors. This study would examine existing manuscripts and notice the ways in which they are corrected. The ways that comments are sometimes incorporated into the text. How lines of text, ending in the same word, can sometimes be omitted because the eye of the copyist runs down to the last word and misses the preceding text; or where a line can be copied twice, especially when the initial word is the same, but the copyist repeats the only one of the lines of text, skipping the second one, instead of moving to next line beginning with the same initial letters, or words, and including the second line of text, as examples of these kinds of errors. These errors are intriguing to study and they often require great skill and imagination to resolve them.
				            - The inevitability of errors in any human activity. It is difficult for a group of people to copy something exactly, even under the best of circumstances. Reading  or copying any text to by a group of listeners (when the text to be copied is spoken aloud), or when various copyists could be given manuscripts that they are to copy, each one  working alone, would invariable result in transcription errors. Errors are sure to occur.
            - Imagine writing in dimly lit monastic chambers, sitting in uncomfortable chairs, with little heat and poor food, and the difficulties would be multiplied. Or if troubled with failing eyesight, trying to copy a text accurately. Or with failing hearing trying to hear the pronunciation of words and thinking you’ve heard correctly, when in fact you did not. All are reasons for transcription and copying errors.
          - The unintentional errors
				            - Faulty eyesight, hearing, or errant writing (as in writing one letter when two was intended, or the reverse; or writing letters, but it is written in Greek abbreviation (to save space: often a line over two main words, like ἨΣ for __th__eo__s__, God) but the abbreviation is not recognized and the letters are not correctly copied.
            - Errors of mind, when the scribe may have been tired, or simply made mistakes in spelling, writing one word when another was intended.
            - Errors of judgment, when a note in the margin would be incorporated into the text of Scripture. Or when a “correction” of a manuscript from a previous hand was actually an error or mistake that was added to a correct text, but the copyist picts up the “correction” and includes in the text, when it was an error that was without merit but because it was copied into the new manuscript, the error is how incorporated into the text. It would take some time to understand when this error occurred, and to recover the original reading (without the error added to it), and to remove the error from the text. This is the work of textual criticism.
          - Intentional changes
				            - Spelling and grammar changed to match the understanding of the scribe, but without any support from the manuscripts.
            - Harmonizing (especially in the Gospel accounts). This is taking the language of one Gospel and adding it to another. The assumption would have been that a shorter reading in a Gospel should be expanded to include the longer reading in another Gospel. Rather than seeing the writers of the Gospels did edit what they included or excluded, and to let their editorial choices stand as they were written.
            - Amplification (where something is clarified by the scribe that would be seen as an explanation added for clarity. Some expository (preaching notes) sometimes find their way into the text. Some notes were written in the margins, and it was not uncommon for these “sermon notes” to be picked up by a later copyist, because they didn’t possess the knowledge to know whether the notes were part of the inspired text or something else, so they were included. In other cases, the amplification would come in difficult passage, where the language is hard to understand or there is some controversial statement made that the copyist tries to soften or explain in some way.
            - Changes to geographical reference names. Names of places are spelled differently in different times. These changes can be seen in the history of the manuscripts, and they are changed to match convention of the day.
            - Conflation of readings, adding one reading on to another, often as a way of equalizing different readings, to force agreement on them, rather than having divergences between the readings.
            - Theological or doctrinal changes. Some terms or words in a manuscript may be removed by a scribe or copyist to conform to the code of conduct of the scribal cult. For example adding words or phrases to include more information or adding a clearer statement of a doctrine taught by a scribal cult than was presented in the manuscript.
          - The practice of textual criticism
				            - Examination of the external evidence of the manuscripts being studied.
					              - Determining the date of the text or portion of the text (called a “witness”)
              - Geographical distribution of the readings (where different manuscripts located at very different locations may have a close proximity in the content of the manuscript, indicating a common source).
              - The division of the manuscripts into textual families (as begun by Westcott and Hort, Aland and Metzger, the United Bible Societies -- UBS, and other groups).
            - The internal evidence
					              - Transcriptional probability (assumptions used to determine the best reading)
						                - The more difficult reading is to be preferred.
                - The shorter reading is to be preferred.
                - When examining parallel passages, there is usually verbal disagreement.
              - Intrinsic probability
						                - Take note of the style and vocabulary of the author of a biblical book, and understand the use of language (formal, informal, agricultural, political, etc., and take note of the style of Greek: is this rich in vocabulary, are idioms used, is it closer to Classical or does the Semitic (Aramaic) appear, and the like) throughout a book.
                - When a writer’s style and vocabulary are understood, then divergences may indicate a change in the text that may have been incorporated by way of a “second hand” – indicating another person. Perhaps a different style of writing, or the use of vocabulary that did not appear in any other section of his writings (helpful when the writer has a substantial volume of text to compare), and that suspicious text is unlike the writing style of the main “hand.” It is therefore called a “second hand.”
                - When a text appears to diverge from the general tenor and style of the majority of the text, it may be suspected that there was an addition to the original.  Context is vitally important in interpretation of the text (exegesis) and it is likewise essential to the process of textual criticism. The author’s teaching elsewhere and in the section being examined can raise questions as to the authenticity of the divergent section.
                - For example. The section of John 7:53-8:11 is unlike the rest of the Gospel of John in several ways.
							                  - This section has no early manuscript support (meaning that the earliest manuscripts do not include this section).
                  - This section is not accepted by most critical commentaries. The great disparity between it and the rest of John’s Gospel, and the exclusion of it from the earliest Greek manuscripts, suggest it as a latter addition and not part of the original Gospel of John.
                  - The grammar, the vocabulary, the idioms are not of the same kind nor do they have a similarity with the grammar and vocabulary of the rest of the Johannine corpus. See Metzger’s note on John 7:53-8:11 in //A Textual Commentary on the Greek New Testament, // ad loc, and other exegetical/ critical commentaries on John. For these reasons, it is considered an addition to the Gospel of John.
            - Some changes appear to be a reaction to the Aramaic background that appears in some of the Gospel accounts. Taking into account the Aramaic background of the teaching of Jesus, has helped scholars to understand some of changes to the Greek text by some of were (perhaps) offended by the Aramaic influence on the Greek of the New Testament.  See C.F.D. Moule, //An Idiom Book of New Testament Greek//, Cambridge University Press, 1953 and later, pp 171ff, “Semiticisms.”
            - The priority of Matthew or Mark as possible, partial source-texts for the other Gospels. The Gospel parallels have made it possible to see how some of each Gospel is touched by the priority of Matthew or Mark. Some later changes are resolved, when a broader harmonization of the Gospels was imposed onto the texts.
            - Conclusions
					              - We should acknowledge the overwhelming and numerous witnesses to the Scriptural text as we have it. There is broad evidence of support for the integrity of the biblical text as we have it today.  Portions of the biblical text that are under question make up less than 4% of the total. Most of those are non-doctrinal, subsidiary matters such as spelling and matters of ambiguity that have little impact on the meaning or message of the text of scripture.
              - We should acknowledge the great age of the textual evidence supporting the biblical text. As the same the time we should understand that there are some matters that may not be resolved through our efforts.
						                - There are matters which cannot be resolved.
							                  - Example:  Romans 5:1, the ἔχ**ο**μεν. The question is regarding the omicron or an omega in the verb.
                  - The two readings change the meaning from “we have …” (with the omicron) to “let us have …” (with the omega) and then the rest of the phrase “… peace with God.”  The “o” omicron would be the form for the indicative mood (“we have peace with God”), stating a fact. The “ω” omega would be the form for subjunctive mood (pointing perhaps a command in this context, “Have peace with God!” or to an exhortation, “Let us have peace with God.”
                  - It is a “C” reading in the Aland/Metzger apparatus in //The////Greek New Testament//, meaning it has equal support for either reading.
                  - This problem appears to be beyond our ability to reconstruction from the manuscript evidence available and scholars and students of textual criticism seem unable to resolve this matter in Romans 5:1 beyond a reasonable doubt. 
                - Richard Pratt suggests that such matters beyond our ability to resolve may exist for the sake of our humility (see reference below). Our humility is necessary as those who faithfully handle the biblical text as expositors or translators.
              - We can understand the broad agreement on the text of Scripture and the relatively small number of matters than remain for us unresolved or perplexingly difficult.

        - Everyone who reads a book or magazine has experienced textual criticism. When a word is omitted or misspelled, we often catch the mistake in our reading and supply from our memory or imagination the necessary word or phrase, or correct the spelling, to make the sentence or paragraph make sense. We do this almost without thinking about it.
			          - In a much broader way the textual criticism of (especially) the New Testament calls upon the faculties of reason, imagination, and good guesses to work through many of the puzzles that exist, as we try, to the best of our ability, to reconstruct the most accurate text from the many thousands of documents and hundreds of thousands and disparities that exist among all the existing documents.
          - It must be quickly added that most of these disparities are inconsequential in nature These examples, that we have reviewed briefly, are merely a few of thousands of issues that the textual critic has dealt with. That being said, the most accurate textual family (from the perspective of many scholars), the Alexandrian family, is still 96% in agreement with what some considered the most “conflated” or “inaccurate” text family (the Byzantine family, or what is called the “Received Text” or by many the “Authorized Text” which is the textual family from which the widely-used King James Version was derived). 
        - The matter of the textual criticism of the Old Testament is a much simpler matter in some ways because the number of manuscripts is much smaller, and the textual families are far fewer.
			          - The Masoretic text was agreed-upon by 900-1,000AD.
				            - (Some have written that the Council of Jamnia, 90AD, was when the text was Hebrew formalized, but this has been largely discredited.)
            - The Dead Sea Scrolls (2<sup>nd</sup> century BC) give strong support to the Masoretic text.
          - Hebrew script was originally without vowel points or accent marks. They were added to the text to protect the accuracy of pronunciation and to clarify and preset the definitions of “homophones” (words that sounded the same, but were spelled differently).
          - The Septuagint (LXX) is a Greek translation of the Hebrew Old Testament in the early 2<sup>nd</sup> century BC, giving us another view of the Old Testament through the eyes of the translators of the Hebrew text at early time. Quotations from the Old Testament in the New Testament were not taken from the Hebrew text, but it seems clear, most often the Old Testament is quoted from the LXX (Septuagint). That Greek translation of the Hebrew Old Testament was read widely throughout First Century Palestine.
      - Exegesis is interpreting or understanding the message of the text, and it is to interpret the concepts, ideas, theological representations, idioms, and figures of speech, in the same manner that they would have been understood by the original author and first readers of an ancient work. This, of course, is a very difficult and high standard to achieve. This task is made more difficult as more and more time passes, and the distance between modern and ancient culture broadens. The relative paucity of non-biblical cultural evidence for the times involved, and the few evidences of mundane documents (from every-day life), he limited amount of cultural and cultic information, and the separation by time from the people who lived so long ago, become more and more difficult to overcome for the one who desires to understand the world of the author of these.
      - Yet, the purpose of exegesis is to understand the text honestly and without presuppositions as to its meaning. It is to do all to allow the text (and the author of that text) to speak for itself, in the context of the events, history, politics, and religious realities at the time of writing.  (See Moulton and Milligan, //Vocabulary of the Greek New Testament // (illustrated from the papyri and other early Christian documents …)
		        - The purpose of exegesis is to read the text as “dispassionately” as possible. That is to say, that the text is to be read without presuppositions as to its meaning. The opinions of the interpreter are not to be injected into the words of the inspired text.
        - Neither should any ideas or concepts be removed or subtracted from the biblical text. Exegesis of the text should present the content, purpose, and meaning of the text as honestly and completely to the reader as possible, without any change, addition or subtraction.
			          - The original is to be protected and honored. It is to be kept free of the private opinions of the interpreter. It is to be translation and interpreted as faithfully as possible, to communicate the meaning of the original text. This is **//exegesis//**. That is the goal of translation and the exposition of the biblical text.
          - To read into the text the opinions and interpretations of the translator (by changing the meaning of the original for personal or sectarian purpose, or through addition to or subtraction from, the original text ) is **//eisegesis//**. This would not be interpretation or translation. It would be a form of plagiarism (presenting your ideas as though they were written by another author).
      - Hermeneutics is a set of sciences and linguistic tools that are applied to ancient texts.
		        - The success of hermeneutics is limited by the imprecision of human language, the shifting modalities of human expression, the changes in meaning of the vocabulary and of the various usages and changing forms of expression that appear in any language over time.
        - Another limitation we have in our human natures and the impediments that sin brings into the life of every biblical interpreter. The Scriptures possess in themselves, as the Word of God, grandeur and a sublime nature. They deal ultimately with the nature of God and his actions in the world.
			          - These great subjects require great humility for every interpreter and the ability to accept the fact that there are some things in the Word of God that are not altogether clear to us, and that they may be included for our faith and for our humility.
          - It is better to say “I don’t know” than to interpret the meaning of a difficult text out of your own imagination or to draw a conclusion without careful study of a matter.
          - The science of textual criticism is limited by and guided by logic and reasoning. Some realities cannot be solved through logic nor can they be rightly determined by rationality alone.
          - Some matters are issues of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and here we speak of the mystery of inspiration.
      - Exegesis is limited by the time that has passed from the time of the writing, the diminishment of clarity of our understanding of the context and history of the time. Much has been lost to time and is unrecoverable.
		        - The authorial intention can easily be replaced by the agenda of the reader of the sacred page, and the where the meaning of the author may be ambiguous or unknown to us, the interpreter may present the reader with a new understanding of the text, quite different from what the author intended to be communicated when it was written.
        - Hermeneutics and exegesis can be powerful tools that offer broad defense of the integrity and authority of the text.
			          - They can support and defend the text with fresh understanding, or they can be used, when faith is not present, as reasons of doubt challenging the authority of scripture and raising questions about the process of inspiration.
          - The faith of the interpreter is a gift of God.
      - The authority of the Bible ultimately rests in the person and authority of Jesus Christ.
		        - Christ quotes from every section of the Hebrew Bible. He asserts that God spoke in the Old Testament. He affirms the authority of the Old Testament as writing about him and his work of redemption. He fulfilled the prophecies of the Old Testament by his own actions and by claiming in his own words to have fulfilled those prophecies. He then assigns to the apostles this same authority to them, whereby they wrote the very words of God by the inspiration of the Spirit.
        - The work of the Holy Spirit of God is crucial to the understanding and application of the word of God in the life of Christian people.
			          - The Holy Spirit was active in the creation of the Word of God.
          - The testimony of the Spirit of God undergirds the authority of scripture.
          - The filling of the Spirit is needed by those who read and interpret the word of God faithfully.
          - The work of the Spirit is to exalt Jesus Christ.
				            - One can see the Spirit of God protecting the transmission of the word of God throughout time, protecting the Bible from serious errors. The Spirit has given us a reliable and faithful text containing all we need for “faith and life.”
            - Although the scholars may not always speak of the ministry of the Spirit in the work of translation and exposition of the Bible, those who most faithfully engage in this work would be quick to acknowledge our dependency on the Spirit of God in the labor of Bible translation and in the proclamation of the message of scripture.
    - Hermeneutics and exegesis have broad areas of overlap, and they can often compete for the same areas of scholarly attention.
	      - Hermeneutics identifies the best witnesses to the original texts. Exegesis is taking that text and interpreting it accurately, so that it can then be accurately understood and then faithfully translated into a new target language where the word of God strengthens those who have saving faith in Christ.
      - D. A. Carson summarizes:  “Exegesis is concerned with actually interpreting the text, whereas hermeneutics is concerned with the nature of the interpretative process. Exegesis concludes by saying, ‘This passage means, such and such’; hermeneutics ends by saying, ‘this interpretative process is constituted by the following techniques and pre-understandings.’ The two are obviously related.” (D.A. Carson, //Exegetical Fallacies, // Baker Books, Grand Rapids, 1998, 25).
      - Hermeneutics – the science of biblical interpretation;  the presuppositions regarding the Biblical text informed by the study of the means, processes, and history by which the Word of God was created, and the means by which Biblical text is properly identified in the manuscript evidence, and then, by means of exegesis, it is accurately understood by those who have faith in Christ (this is interpretation), and then translated into other languages (this is translation), as God leads. The overlap between hermeneutics and exegesis is present in this outline.
      - Exegesis – the application of the science of biblical interpretation to the text of Scripture with the search for the meaning of the text so it can be applied to the lives of the readers and to the believing community through proclamation and application of the meaning of the text of Scripture.
      - Qualifications of the interpreter or translator of the Bible.
		        - Faith – the Bible is a document “of faith and for faith” (see Hebrews 12:2, “… Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith ….” ESV).  Without faith it is impossible to please God (see Hebrews 11:6), and, the corollary, it is impossible to know God (cf. Galatians 4:9).
        - New birth -- the interpretation of the Scriptures is something that should be done by those who have experienced the new birth. Jesus tells us that eternal life is necessary to understand and experience the saving message of the Bible (see John 5:39-40). The Bible is about salvation that is found in Jesus Christ alone.
        - Humility
			          - We come to the Bible and admit that we know so little.
          - We realize our dependency upon God as we seek to understand his word.
          - We recognize and accept the seriousness of our responsibility as those who read, study, interpret, and translate the Bible.
        - Purity – there is a moral purity that is required of those who handle the word of God and who teach it to others or who are translating its message. See 1 Timothy 4:12, where “purity” is a requirement of one who faithfully handle the word of God (see 4:13).
        - Diligence – the study of the word of God is a life-long endeavor. One cannot stop reading, studying, learning about the word of God. The greatest scholar continues to contemplate and meditate on the word of God. Diligence is required because of the extent of the biblical content (66 books, 1189 chapters, 31,102 verses in the whole Bible). The study of other languages requires diligence and time. The study of history, reading commentaries, dictionaries, studying maps, concordances, and lexicons, all require knowledge plus diligence in their use.  (See Proverbs 13:4, 2 Timothy 2:15, 1 Corinthians 15:58.)
        - Patience – some matters of biblical interpretation are resolved not by application of more effort, but through patience and trust in God. The ability to wait on the LORD (Isaiah 40:31) is a crowning quality in the life of the interpreter and translator of the word of God.
        - Restraint
			          - The mental discipline to not jump to conclusions and to check that one’s facts are correct and that you have understood the points with which you are interacting. A strong reaction may be evidence of a bias not of a conviction.
          - Avoiding extremes of interpretation and understanding when one has pushed past the limits of scholarship and has entered into the land of imagination or worse, the need to correct or amend something that is unclear in the word of God.
          - “I do not know.” These words must be an active part of our daily confession to God, and they demonstrate honesty about our limitations and incapacities. Some problems are beyond our abilities.
        - Farsightedness – to understand your place in the greater body of Christ. Our work is best done in connection with other believers in Christ. We are focused on those who will benefit from our labors.
        - Imagination – the interpreter and translator needs imagination to discover the meaning of the text and to understand how to express these words, ideas, stories, and rules, to another culture and language.  Imagination is not flights of fantasy or whimsy, but the ability to see possibilities, ideas, and concepts in new and wonderful ways.
        - Openness – the willingness for the Holy Spirit to lead us in ways we did not expect, but which we will follow. This is the ability to discover, not to invent. Scriptures judge us, not we them.
        - Love – the work of interpretation and translation must create the bond of love with those we are laboring with. And it must increase our love for God, lest we preach to others but are not benefited by the message we teach and translate ourselves.
        - The goal of biblical interpreter and translator is that we might know God.

    - (This is 4a in the original outline)The practice of hermeneutics and exegesis – a primer
	      - The Bible has human authors, by divine authority. The Bible is human book. The people in it are real people (despite the claim of some that some are mythological). They lived in real places, in time, in history. The human authors are children of their day, and they thought and they spoke, they wrote and they lived in their era, their locale, and in their culture. Some biblical authors are difficult to place in a particular place because their identity is not altogether clear (the author of Hebrews, for instance). But much is known of other biblical writers.
		        - Personality, education, experience, calling,  etc of the human author help the interpreter to understand what the writer intended.
			          - The education of Paul as a Pharisee is very informative in his handling of the “law” of God. Knowing the imprisonment of Paul dramatically impacts the understanding of the prison epistles. Peter’s impending death may explain the differences between 1 and 2 Peter in terms of vocabulary and the smoothness of the first against the roughness of the second letter.  Luke’s training as a physician is helpful in measuring his medical insights. The fact that Luke accompanied the apostolic band in the Book of Acts, brings an eyewitness account to those pages. John’s long life gives us a glimmer into the differences between John and the Synoptic Gospels in style and perspective. The background of the book (Old Testament or New) must be clearly in mind before interpretation or translation should begin.
        - The inspiration of the Bible.
			          - The Bible is unlike any other book. It bears the authority of God himself, as the inspired and authoritative record of all we need for life and for our salvation.
				            - Christ quotes from the major sections of the Old Testament. He claimed to fulfill some of the most hopeful promises and prophecies. He promises his Spirit to his disciples, and gives his authority to his apostles. The apostolic authority of the Bible is from Christ himself. 
					              - Some people today doubt the authority and the truth of the Bible. There have always been skeptics. But the Bible continues to be validated, even by modern standards, in its history, in the reality of those who it purports to represent (from Moses to John the Evangelist).
              - Its message has been experienced, proven as reliable (by the fluctuating standards of scholars), and the same faith in Christ that we believe is shared with a like faith in the time of Christ and throughout the Christian era with a vast testimony of Christian men and women who have given their lives for the Gospel of God.
            - The Bible is not a comprehensive book about every facet of human life. It is not a psychology text, nor is it a book of geometry or astrophysics. But in all that it affirms as factually true, it is accurate and it is consistent with reality and with the truth about God.
            - The Bible does not answer every question we can raise. We must be careful to let the Bible speak on everything it addresses. We must be careful not to read into the Bible things that the Bible does not address, or to change the focus of the writers of the Bible to engage them in modern debates that would have been foreign to their thinking.
            - Much of our modern science is simply not included as a subject within any part of the biblical narrative. There is nothing in the Bible that is contrary to true science (of any subject), but often the Bible affirms many points that enlighten us, but it may not give a complete report on every subject. It gives us what we need for “faith and life.” It does not tell us about everything. It tells us about the God who knows everything and who does all that he desires to do.
            - Apologetics is the field of theological, philosophical, and historical study which addresses the truthfulness of the biblical account against charges that it is not true;  and it sets for arguments and defenses of the truth and veracity of the accounts of the Bible in witness to the truth of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Every generation must defend their faith and declare the assertions of the Bible regarding God and all things, to the next generation. Apologetics will continue to be active until the return of Christ to the earth.
          - Inspiration is claimed by the writers of scripture themselves
				            - The inspiration of the Bible is claimed by the writers.
					              - The inspiration of the Bible is not a doctrine that is imposed upon the Bible. It is what the Bible claims for itself.
						                - The prophets of the Old Testament claimed to speak the “word of the LORD.”  Exodus 7:1 describes one who “speaks for God to man.”  The prophets received the word of God, it fell upon them, the hand of the LORD was strong upon them, and in other ways these prophets described how the word of God came to them and they were compelled to speak it to the people.
							                  - “Thus says the LORD,” “Hear the word of the LORD,” Thus has the LORD God show unto me …,” “The word of the LORD came unto ….”
                  - The prophets would often shift from telling what the word of the LORD was, to actually speaking in the first person, as though God were speaking directly to the people (see Isa 3:4; 5:3ff; 10:5ff.,; 27:3; Jer 5:7; 16:21; Hos 6:4; Joel 2:25; Amos 5:21; and Zech 9:7).
            - The authority of the Bible is confirmed by Jesus Christ by his use of the Old Testament as authoritative and his confirmation of many events and persons (Creation, Adam and Eve, Exodus, David, the Prophets, quotations from the OT (especially Psalms, e.g. Psalm 82:6), reading portions of the OT and claiming to have fulfilled them.
					              - //Theopneustos//,  2 Timothy 3:16 “all scripture is God-breathed.” This is the //locus classicus//, or the foundational verse for the inspiration of the Bible.
              - 2 Peter 1:19-21 (“but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.” (ESV)
              - 1 Corinthians 2:7-13 “And we impart this in words not taught by human wisdom but taught by the Spirit, interpreting spiritual truths to those who are spiritual.” (ESV)
          - Verbal inspiration and other options
				            - The “writings” or “scriptures” or “The Scripture” were the names most often used when referring to the Old Testament, when it is quoted by Jesus or others in the New Testament. They were also referred to as the “holy writings” or “holy scriptures” (see Romans 1:2; 2 Timothy 3:16).
            - The Scriptures were understood as being the same as saying, “God says, ….”
          - Plenary inspiration.
				            - Some scholars have objected to the term “verbal” inspiration, because they felt that it contained some mechanical theory, like dictation, where God spoke words and the human author just wrote down the words. They prefer, rather, the term, “plenary” inspiration. Plenary inspiration refers more to the thoughts that are being inspired by God and communicated to human authors.
					              - The writers wrote that the Holy Spirit taught them “words.” The scriptures were “words which the Holy Spirit teaches” (as in 1 Corinthians 2:13, see above). 
              - There are other examples when the New Testament writers considers a specific word in the Old Testament (Galatians 3:16, e.g.), not a thought or idea, but a specific word. This focus on individual words may point to those words which the Holy Spirit determined to be written by the human writer.
              - Words seemed to be important to the Holy Spirit. Therefore, there is merit to the concept of verbal inspiration. It was not just the thoughts that were inspired; the words mattered to the writers of the Bible, as well.
            - Human and divine authorship.
					              - Each book of the Bible is written by a human being. But it is the Christian claim that each book is inspired by God and governed by him to the end that it would be true to say that the Bible is the word of God, and therefore, it is without error or mistake.
              - The personality, language skills, background, training and education, religious life and many other factors of the human authors of the Bible, can be identified.
						                - John’s Gospel is very different from Matthew. Daniel (in Aramaic) is worlds apart from the pure classic Hebrew of Isaiah.  Jonah is very different in tone, vocabulary, and general approach from Hosea. Parts of the Psalms are clearly from David’s hand; other parts are from many others who wrote other Psalms. The writers of the Books of the Bible were different from each other. But they all experienced the inspiration of God so that what they wrote was the very word of God, and the word of human authors, as well.
                - But the divine authority in the books that are written is affirmed by the external witnesses to the authority of the Bible and by the internal witness of the Holy Spirit within God’s people.
              - The affirmation of inerrancy is generally affirmed only for the original manuscripts, and inspiration was limited to the text of scripture, and not to the human author’s life after the completion of writing the books of Scripture.
						                - But those original documents appear to be forever lost.
                - All we have are copies of the originals.
              - From the time of the Reformation, the doctrine of plenary and verbal inspiration has been, until the current age, the majority view of all Christians in every age.
						                - The affirmation has been made that the inspiration of the original writings is not corrupted by the loss of those original documents,
                - but the broad testimony of the manuscript evidence and the relative paucity of problem words and verses, points to an oversight of the Holy Spirit not only in the writing of the word of God, but in its preservation and transmission through the ages.
            - “Out of some eight hundred thousand [written about the year 1950AD] various reading of the Bible that have been collected, about seven hundred and ninety-five thousand are of about as much importance to the sense of the Greek and Hebrew Scriptures as the question in English orthography is, whether the //honour//  shall be spelled with a //u//  or without it. Of the remainder, some change the sense of particular passages or expressions, or omit particular words or phrases; but no one doctrine of religion is changed, not one precept is taken away, not one important fact is altered, by the whole of the various readings collectively taken.” ( Moses, Stuart, and Garbett, quotation in Berkhof, //Principles of Biblical Interpretation, // 1950, 50).
          - Diversity of the Bible.
				            - The Bible is made of two testaments, the Old and the New.
					              - The Old is primarily about promise. The New is primarily about fulfillment.
              - The Old is prophetic (the prophets chiefly writing the content). The new is apostolic.
              - The Old is written in Hebrew and Aramaic. The New in Koine Greek.
              - Each book of the Bible has distinguishing qualities. The Bible in not uniform in style. It is written by many different people over nearly 1,600 years of time.
              - The forms of the Bible are variable. Most of the Bible is historical narrative (this would be under the Unity of the Bible). The Old Testament finds Law and Wisdom literature. Parables and epistolary words fill out the bulk of the New Testament. Both Old and New have apocalyptic literature, but of vastly different qualities and pointing so some unifying features, and some very disparate.
              - Prophecy is present in both testaments, giving both the fore-telling of future events and the forth-telling of the word of God to specific peoples and nations.
              - There is a vast resource of poetry in the Old Testament (chiefly in the Psalms), which is unparalleled in the New.
          - Unity of the Bible
				            - The books of the Bible have a unity of subject and a unity of purpose. Despite the various subjects, there is a unity in approach to the worship of the One True God.
            - The Bible is not a book that is read differently from others. But, perhaps because of its inspiration, it is to be read like any book, but with great care.
            - The purpose of the Bible is the revelation of God’s character and person, his work in creation and redemption, and his desire to make himself known in the created order.
            - One can speak of the simplicity of the Bible. Not that everything is equally clear and simple in that way; but that the word of God communicates what God intended to say.
					              - The language of scripture is often direct and unambiguous.
              - The use of grammar is very clear, and only rarely is it obscure.
              - Direct discourse is often used, where indirect discourse might be expected.
              - Abstract truths are explained in very specific and concrete terms.
              - Difficult concepts are expressed in accessible idioms and in common forms of speech.
            - Poetry especially uses repetitive restatement of principles, so that the purpose of the poem is made increasingly clear and the poem progresses.
					              - Or antithetic parallelism is used for contrast and illustration of the opposite. Synthetic, correspondent, or cumulative parallelism adds informing language to build successive layers of information to make things more clear.
