Adding content in Door43 is easy! Follow these simple steps to get started:


===== 1. Create an Account & Log into Door43 =====


To start adding content, you will need a user account on Door43. If you do not have an account, [[:en:get-started?do=register|create one]] then you can [[https://door43.org/en/obs-training/get-started?do=login&sectok=ee4e19eb537ef77891aa5a6b54b7b2a4|login]].\\ 
You can watch this [[http://youtu.be/dpsJRDAa3I8|video]] (45 seconds long) to see how to set up an account.


    * Click on the Register link at the top of the page.
    * Fill in the necessary information to set up an account.
    * Check your email for the automatic generated password. (You might find the email in your spam folder.)
    * Click on the 'Update Profile' link to change the password.


===== 2. Practice Editing a Page =====


Door43 has a [[:playground:playground|test page]] that you can freely edit to try things out. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dF7px5U6PdA|Here]] is a short video (45 seconds) on how to switch between the text editor and the graphical editor.


**Graphical Editor**  – When you click the "Edit this page" button, you will see an edit window that looks like a simplified word processor. Click [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFK1zK_dSYc|here]] for the "how to" 1 minute video. The buttons take care of formatting text and generally make it easier to use. Here is information on the toolbar icons: [[doku>toolbar|quickbuttons]].


**Text Editor**  – You can click the “DW Edit” button beneath the edit box to switch to a text-based editor. This is the standard DokuWiki editor and it provides full control over the syntax of the text. Go to the [[:en:obs-training:syntax|Formatting Text]] page for some simple editing formats to use in the text editor.


//Note://  when using the text editor, you can switch back to the graphical editor by clicking the “FCK Edit” button.


===== 3. Add a Page =====


Adding a page is easy! In - the URL field of the Internet browser add a title of your page to end of the workbench URL.


    - You will add to the end of [[http://door43.org/en/ta/workbench/|http://door43.org/en/ta/workbench/]] the title of your page.
    - Press the enter key.
    - You will open a new page that says “This page does not exist yet”.
    - Left click on the Pencil with the plus sign to create the page.
    - Start writing in your information.


It's that simple! The title of your page can be anything. If you find a page with that already exists, please try another page name. Why not put a number at the end of the title?


Please add a **discussion panel**  to the bottom of every page. A discussion panel allows others to comment on your work and share their thoughts and resources on what you have written. Here is how to add a discussion panel on your page.


<code>
Type in ~~DISCUSSION~~ at the bottom of the page.
The discussion panel will appear below your information.
</code>


===== 4. Add Tags to a Page =====


Add tags to every one of your pages. Tags are a way to categorize the topics of your page. For example, if you were writing about Hebrew text for Genesis, you would tag your page with the words "Hebrew" and "Genesis." Here are instructions on how to add tags to your page.


<code>
{{tag>[tag1]}} Where the words 'tag1' is replaced by a topic on your page.  
For instance, if you were writing about Hebrew the tag would read: {{tag>[Hebrew]}}.  
Spaces between words will set multiple tags. For example: {{tag>[Hebrew]}} will make
a "Hebrew" tag but {{tag>[Hebrew Genesis]}} will make two tags - one for "Hebrew" and
one for "Genesis."
</code>


You can copy the code above and just replace "Hebrew" and "Genesis" with your topics.
