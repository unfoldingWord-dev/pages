====== Modules ======


Modules are structured as answers to questions. These are some of the questions needing answers:


    - Why should I do a meaning-based translation?
    - How do I do a meaning-based translation?
    - How do I translate something that does not exist in my language?
    - What do I do if what I understand the text to say is impossible? (Jesus walking __on top__ of the water?)
