====== Modules ======


Modules are structured as answers to questions. These are some of the questions needing answers:


    - What is meaning-based translation?
    - Why should I do a meaning-based translation?
    - How do I do a meaning-based translation?
    - How do I translate something that does not exist in my language?
    - What do I do if what I understand the text to say is impossible? (Jesus walking __on top__  of the water? How do I distinguish the miraculous from a figure of speech such as "He was walking on thin ice"?)
    - What do I do if there is something more I need to know in order to translate it into my language? (Such as formal versus familiar forms of 'you', singular versus dual or plural forms of 'you')?
    - What do I do if people give the wrong answer to a comprehension question? (Distinguishing lack of clarity in a translation from lack of background knowledge on the part of the audience.)
    - How should I translate names of people and places that I do not have in my language? (Peter)
    - How can I tell if terms in the story mean the same thing as they do in my culture? (ghost)
    - How should I translate forms of address? (Master…; O you…)
    - What if I don't understand how the action in the frames is connected? (Then; Meanwhile)
    - What do I do if something is stated in a way that I cannot translate into my language? (storm had come up; turned his eyes)
    - What do I do if the text I am translating has a cultural practice that is foreign to my context?
    - How do I edit pages and text in the translation interface?
    - What is my personal beliefs or the beliefs of my denomination do not agree with the OBS text?
