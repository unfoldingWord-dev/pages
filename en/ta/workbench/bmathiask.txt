//**Branches of Linguistics/Properties of Language in General:** // 


Languages have two main components: 1) sound, 2) meaning


1) Sound:


**//Phonology/Phonetics//**: speech sounds; sounds that humans make in speaking their languages


2) Meaning:


**//Syntax//**: word order; the order of words in sentences


**//Morphology//**: how words are formed (//**roots **//& //**affixes**//)//. **Affix **//is a general term for //**prefixes **//and //**suffixes**//.


**//Semantics//**: meaning; the meaning of words and sentences


//**Parts of Speech Definitions:** // 


//**Noun**//: a "thing" word


**//Adjective//**: a describing word


//**Verb**//: an action word


//**Transitive verb**//: an action word that MAY OR MAY NOT happen TO something


//**Intransitive Verb**//: an action word that CANNOT happen TO something


Most action words can be //**Transitive **//or //**Intransitive**//.


e.g. 'to fail'...I failed, I failed __the test__ 


However, any action word that CANNOT happen TO something is strictly **//Intransitive//**.


e.g. 'to sit'...*I sat __the chair__ 


//**Subject**//: the "do-er" of an action


//**Direct Object**//: the thing that an action gets done to


**//Preposition//**: a location-related word that goes before a "thing" word, e.g. in, on, at, to
