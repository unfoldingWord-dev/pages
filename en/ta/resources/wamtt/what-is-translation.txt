====== What is translation? ======


Think about times when you have heard a story or report being translated from one language into another. When the person translating did a good job, what did the person do that made his or her translation a good one? When the person translating did not do a good job, what did the person do (or not do) that made his or her translation a poor one?


The following is a definition of translation that we will keep thinking about throughout this course:


Translation is re-telling, as exactly as possible, the meaning of the original message in a way that is natural in the language into which the translation is being made.
