====== Quiche Story ======

The Quiché people live in the country of Guatemala. They have their own language and stories. You probably do not understand the Quiché language. You can only understand and enjoy these stories if a Quiché speaker translates the stories into a language you understand. Here is one Quiché story, translated into English in two very different ways. Read aloud these two translations of the story, and then answer the questions.
First translation:

“It is said that being one man not from here, not known where the his or the he comes where. One day these things he walks in a finca or in them the coastlands, he saw his appearance one little necklace, or he thought that a little necklace the very pretty thrown on the ground in the road. He took the necklace this he threw in his mouth for its cause that coming the one person another to his behindness, for his that not he encounters the one the following this way in his behindness, not he knows and that the necklace the he threw in his mouth this one snake and the man this one died right now because not he knows his appearance the snake or that the he ate this not this a necklace only probably this snake.”

In the first translation, each Quiché word has been replaced by the nearest English word. This copies the way of saying things in the Quiché language into the English translation.
Second translation:

“There is a story about a certain man. He didn’t come from this part of the world, and indeed, I don’t know where he came from. One day this man was walking in the coastlands (in a ‘finca’ as they say), when he saw a little necklace, or rather, what he thought was a very pretty little necklace, lying in the road. There was someone coming along behind him, so he grabbed this necklace and threw it into his mouth, because he didn’t want that other person to see it. Well, he did not know that the necklace that he threw in his mouth was really a snake. And the man died there and then because he did not recognize that particular kind of snake, and did not know that the thing he put in his mouth was not a necklace at all, but a snake.”[1]
