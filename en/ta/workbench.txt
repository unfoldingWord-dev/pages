After you know how to edit a page and add a new page, we ask that you add to every one of your pages two important lines.//
The first is **tag your page**.

<code>
{{tag>[tag1]}} Where the words 'tag1' is replaced by a topic on your page.  
For instance, if you were writing about discourse the tag would read: {{tag>[discourse]}}.  
Spaces between words will set multiple tags. For example: {{tag>[discourse]}} will make a discourse tag but {{tag>[discourse topic]}} will make two tags - one for discourse and one for topic.  
</code>

The second is add a **discussion panel**. A discussion panel allows others to comment on your work and share their thoughts and resources on what you have written.

<code>
Type in ~~~Discussion~~~ anywhere on the page. The discussion panel will appear below your information.
</code>
