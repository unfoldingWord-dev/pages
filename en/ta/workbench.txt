Adding content in Door43 is easy! Follow these simple steps to get started:


===== 1. Create an Account & Log into Door43 =====


To start adding content, you will need a user account on Door43. If you do not have an account, [[:en:get-started?do=register|create one]] then you can [[https://door43.org/en/obs-training/get-started?do=login&sectok=ee4e19eb537ef77891aa5a6b54b7b2a4|login]].\\ 
You can watch this [[http://youtu.be/dpsJRDAa3I8|video]] (45 seconds long) to see how to set up an account.


    * Click on the Register link at the top of the page.
    * Fill in the necessary information to set up an account.
    * Check your email for the automatic generated password. (You might find the email in your spam folder.)
    * Click on the 'Update Profile' link to change the password.


===== 2. Practice Editing a Page =====


Door43 has a [[:playground:playground|test page]] that you can freely edit to try things out. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dF7px5U6PdA|Here]] is a short video (45 seconds) on how to switch between the text editor and the graphical editor.


**Graphical Editor**  â€“ When you click the "Edit this page" button, you will probably see an edit window that looks like a simplified word processor. Click [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFK1zK_dSYc|here]] for the "how to" 1 minute video. The buttons take care of formatting text and generally make it easier to use. Here is information on the toolbar icons: [[doku>toolbar|quickbuttons]].


**Text Editor**  â€“ If you prefer, you can click the "DW Edit" button beneath the edit box to switch to a text-based editor. This is the standard DokuWiki editor and it provides full control over the syntax of the text. Go to the [[:en:obs-training:syntax|Formatting Text]] page for some simple editing formats to use in the text editor.


//Note://  when using the text editor, you can switch back to the graphical editor by clicking the "FCK Edit" button.
