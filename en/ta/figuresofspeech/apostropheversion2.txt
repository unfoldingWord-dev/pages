====== [APO] Apostrophe [əˈpästrəfē] ======


=== In apostrophe, someone makes an exclamation to people who are not there with them. They could even be imaginary people or a thing or idea that is treated as if it were a person. ===


**Examples from the Bible** 


O people of [MTY] Jerusalem [APO]! You killed the prophets who lived long ago, and you killed others, whom God sent to you, by throwing stones at them…. Luke 13:34b (TFT)


Jesus made this exclamation about the people of Jerusalem. But he was outside the city, and the people of the city were not there listening to him. Some of what he said was about people who had lived long ago and were no longer alive.
