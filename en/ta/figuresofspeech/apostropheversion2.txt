__O people of [MTY] Jerusalem [APO]!__ You killed the prophets who lived long ago, and you killed others, whom God sent to you, by throwing stones at them…. Luke 13:34b (TFT)

Jesus made this exclamation to the people of Jerusalem as if they were there listening to him. But he was outside the city, and the people of the city were not there listening to him. And some of what he said was addressed to people who had lived long ago and were no longer alive. In this way he expressed his sadness deep sadness about the people of Jerusalem.
