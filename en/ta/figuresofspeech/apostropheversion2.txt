=== In apostrophe, someone makes an exclamation to people who are not there with them. They could even be imaginary people or a thing or idea that is treated as if it were a person. ===


**Examples from the Bible** 

O people of [MTY] Jerusalem [APO]! You killed the prophets who lived long ago, and you killed others, whom God sent to you, by throwing stones at them…. Luke 13:34b (TFT)

Jesus made this exclamation to the people of Jerusalem as if they were there listening to him. But he was outside the city, and the people of the city were not there listening to him. And some of what he said was addressed to people who had lived long ago and were no longer alive. In this way he expressed his sadness deep sadness about the people of Jerusalem.

Death [APO] will not win a victory over us. Death will not be able to hurt us. 1 Cor 15:55 (TFT)

Paul quoted this saying: "Death, where is your victory? Death, where is your sting?" Paul was speaking to death as if it were a person and taunting it because it will not have any power to harm people.
