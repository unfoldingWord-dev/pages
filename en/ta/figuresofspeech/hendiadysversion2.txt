====== [HEN] Hendiadys [henˈdīədəs] ======


=== In hendiadys a single idea is expressed with two words connected with “and,” when one word could be used to modify the other. This figure of speech is common in Hebrew writing. Jewish people also used it when writing in the Greek language. ===


**Examples from the Bible** 

because I will make you __wise__ [HEN] so that you will //know// __what to say__. Luke 21:15a (TFT)

Jesus said that he would give them “a mouth and wisdom”. This is an example of hendiadys. The word “mouth” here refers to “words,” or "what to say," and the phrase could be translated as “wise words” or "wise things to say".

//Specifically, we// kept strongly exhorting/urging and encouraging you that you conduct your lives in the way that God’s people should, //because// he has invited you to become his people over whom he will __wonderfully rule__ [HEN]. 1 Thes 2:12 (TFT)

Paul wrote about God calling us into his own "kingdom and glory”. God's kingdom and his glory are not two separate things that God calls us into. Rather his kingdom is glorious. The phrase "kingdom and glory" is an example of hendiadys. Some versions translate this as "glorious kingdom". In the TFT it is translated as "wonderfully rule."
