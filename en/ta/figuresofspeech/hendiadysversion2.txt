====== [HEN] Hendiadys [henˈdīədəs] ======


=== In hendiadys a single idea is expressed with two words connected with “and,” when one word could be used to modify the other. This figure of speech is common in Hebrew writing. Jewish people also used it when writing in the Greek language. ===


**Examples from the Bible** 

because I will make you wise [HEN] so that you will know what to say.

Jesus said that he would give them “a mouth and wisdom”. This is an example of hendiadys. The word “mouth” here refers to “words,” and the phrase could be translated as “wise words” or “words of wisdom”, with “wise” or “of wisdom” modifying “words”.Luke 21:15a (TFT)
