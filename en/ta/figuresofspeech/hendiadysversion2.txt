====== [HEN] Hendiadys [henˈdīədəs] ======


=== In hendiadys a single idea is expressed with two words connected with “and,” when one word could be used to modify the other. This figure of speech is common in Hebrew writing. Jewish people also used it when writing in the Greek language. ===

Rather his kingdom is glorious. The phrase "kingdom and glory" is an example of hendiadys. Some versions translate this as</font> "glorious kingdom". In the TFT it is translated as "wonderfully rule."
