====== [DOU] Doublet [ˈdəblət] ======

===A doublet states the same thought in two ways.===
 
**Examples from the Bible** 

Do not say how sinfully others have acted, and then //God// will not say how sinfully you have acted.\\ 
Do not condemn others, and then //he// will not condemn you [DOU]. Luke 6:37 (TFT)

This is a doublet. Saying how sinfully others have acted and condemning others are very similar.

Prepare the way for the Lord,\\ 
make his paths straight. Mark 1:3b, NET

As people straighten out pathways //before an important official arrives // [MET],\\ 
make //yourselves // ready [DOU] //in order that you will be prepared when// the Lord //comes//.” Mark 1:3b (TFT)

This is a doublet. "Prepare the way for the Lord" and "Make his paths straight" mean the same thing. It is also a metaphor. The TFT expresses the metaphor as a simile with "As people straighten out pathways before an important official arrives, make yourselves ready" and it gives the purpose for doing it with "in order that you will be prepared when the Lord comes."
---------------------------

 But as the man went out he began to announce it publicly and spread the story widely, Mark 1:45a NET

The man went //and presented himself to the priest. But then // he began to tell many people about //how Jesus had healed him // [DOU]. Mark 1:45a (TFT)

This is a doublet. "Announce it publicly: and "spread the story widely" mean basically the same thing. The TFT expresses it once with "tell many people".

For nothing is hidden except to be revealed, 
and nothing is concealed except to be brought to light. Mark 4:22, NET

//Similarly//, there are some //parts of God's message // that people do not know. //But he intends that // people will understand all the things that they do not know //now//. Mark 4:22, TFT

When Jesus spoke he used a doublet. "Nothing is hidden except to be revealed" and "nothing is concealed expect to be brought to light" mean the same thing. The TFT states this idea once with the sentence "But he intended that people will understand all the things that they do not know now."
