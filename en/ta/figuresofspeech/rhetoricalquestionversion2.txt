====== [RHQ] Rhetorical Question ======


=== A rhetorical question is a question that is used for something other than getting information. Often it indicates the speaker’s attitude toward the topic or the listener. ===


**Examples from the Bible** 

So ◄I cannot believe that what you(sg) said will happen!/how can I believe that what you(sg) said will happen?► Luke 1:18 (TFT).

When Zechariah asked the angel how he could be sure that what the angel said was true, he was asking a rhetorical question. What he meant was that he could not believe that what the angel said was true.

They were saying, “We wonder what work the child will do for God when he grows up [RHQ]!”Luke 1:66

When the people were asking what the child would grow up to be, they were not expecting anyone to answer their question. They were simply expressing that they wondered about it because they were impressed by the surprising things they had heard about his birth.

“◄I am surprised that you(dl) did not know where to find me!/Why did you not know where to find me?► [RHQ] Luke 2:49b (TFT)

When Jesus asked his parents why they were looking for them, he did not expect them to tell him why. He was expressing his surprise that they did not know where to find him. He may have also been mildly rebuking them for not knowing where to find him.

◄You(dl) should have known that it was necessary for me to be in my Father's house!/Did you not know that it was necessary for me to be in my Father's house?► [RHQ]” Luke 2:49c

When Jesus asked his parents if they didn't know that he needed to be in his Father's house, he was mildly rebuking them and saying that they should  have know that he needed to be there.

I warn you that //God// will some day punish [MTY] //everyone// who sins. And ◄do not think that you can escape //from his punishing// [MTY] //you if you do not turn from your sinful behavior!// / //did someone tell you// that you can escape //from his punishing// [MTY] //you if you do not turn from your sinful behavior?//► [RHQ] (OR, Who told you that you could escape //God's punishment//?) Luke 3:7 (TFT)

When John asked the crowds who had warned them to flee from God's punishment, he was not expecting them to say someone's name. He was rebuking them harshly for going to him to him to be baptized in order to escape God's punishment when they had no desire to stop sinning.

For we wanted to come to you … For who is our hope or joy or crown to boast of before our Lord Jesus at his coming? Is it not of course you? 1 Thes 2:18, 19, NET


//We were strongly desiring to be with you, because __truly you __//[RHQ] //__are the ones about whom we are proud and are joyful!__ It is because we are confident that you will remain faithful/continue believing in God that we will be joyful. __You are the ones that we confidently expect __ will keep strongly trusting in God! I__t is because you will remain faithful/continue believing in God that we will be proud of the work that we have done__//[MET, RHQ] //when our Lord Jesus examines what we all have done, at the time when he comes back to earth//! 1 Thes 2:19, TFT


In the verse above, Paul used the first rhetorical question with the word “who” to help the Thessalonians focus on the fact that they were the ones that he was so proud and joyful about. Then to emphasize that even more, he answered his rhetorical question with another rhetorical question whose answer is obviously “Yes, the Thessalonians are the ones.”
