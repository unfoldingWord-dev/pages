====== [SIM] Simile [ˈsiməlē] ======


=== In simile something is compared to something else of a different kind in order to focus on a particular trait that they both have in common. The fact that there is a comparison is stated clearly with ‘like’ or ‘as’. ===

**Examples from English** \\ 
Someone might say about a dishonest (crooked) businessman "He is __as crooked as a dog's hind leg__." (English speakers associate truth with being straight and dishonesty with crookedness.) \\ 
Someone might say about a person who doesn't get emotional in a very stressful situation, "She was __as cool as a cucumber__". (English speakers associate emotion with heat and lack of emotion with coolness.)\\ 
If someone slept very well without waking during the night, he might say "I slept __like a log__." (Logs don't move, and a person who sleeps very well isn't aware of moving around while sleeping.)

**Examples from the Bible**\\
Many times I wanted to gather you together __to protect you__ [SIM] like a hen gathers her young chicks under her wings.... Luke 13:34b (TFT)

In this simile Jesus compared the protection he wanted to give the people of Jerusalem to the kind of protection a hen gives to her chicks when they are in danger. It's not that he would literally gather the people, but he would protect them and they would trust him.
-----------------

Because when the lightning flashes and lights up the sky from one side to the other, //everyone can see it. Similarly,// [SIM] at the time [MTY] when //I//, the one who came from heaven, come back again, //everyone will see me.// Luke 17:24 (TFT)

Jesus said that his coming back to earth would be like when the lightning flashes. He didn't say how it would be like it, but we can understand from the context that just as lighting happens suddenly and everyone can see it, he will come suddenly and everyone will be able to see him. No one will have to be told about it.

//You know also that we lovingly behaved/acted toward each one of you __as a father lovingly behaves/acts toward his own children__ // [SIM]//.// Thes 2:11 (TFT)

In this example of simile, Paul compares his behavior to that of a father. He was not the father of the Thessalonian Christians, they were not children, and he was not raising them in his home. But he was loving and gentle toward them as he taught them just as a father is loving and gentle toward his children as he teaches them.
