**Some examples from the Bible** 


//That is, he wants each one of you to know how to control your own __sexual desiresu[EUP]. He wants you to live pure lives that all people will see as good. u 1 Thes 4:4 (TFT)


When Paul wrote to the Thessalonians, he wrote about them controlling their own “bodies”. But what he probably meant is for them to control their sexual desires. Sometimes people feel embarrassed talking about sexual desires. For Paul, the word “bodies” was less embarrassing or offensive than a phrase like “sexual desires.”

//My fellow believers, we also want you to understand well [LIT] what will happen to our fellow believers who now __are deadu[EUP].u1 Thes 4:13a (TFT)


When Paul wrote to the Thessalonians, he wrote about fellow believers who were “asleep”. But what he meant is that they were dead. Sometimes people don't like to speak directly about death because it is unpleasant. For Paul, “asleep” was a more gentle way to speak about being dead.
