====== [EUP] Euphemism [ˈyo͞ofəˌmizəm] ======


=== A euphemism is a mild or polite way of referring to something that is unpleasant or embarrassing. ===


**Some examples from English:** \\ 
“Adult beverages” refers to “beer or liquor.”\\ 
“He passed away” and “He departed” means “He died.”\\ 
“He slept with her” usually means “They had sexual relations with each other.”\\ 
“Bathroom” and “restroom” refer to a room that has a toilet in it.


**Some examples from the Bible** 

When Elizabeth had been //pregnant// [EUP] //for almost// six months, Luke 1:26a (TFT)

Luke simply wrote __in the sixth month__ to refer to the sixth month of Elizabeth's pregnancy. This euphemism avoids the word "pregnancy". 
-----------------

And God [SYN/EUP] spoke Luke 3:22 (TFT)

Luke wrote that __a voice__ came from heaven. The word "voice" refers to God. (See Synecdoche). People often avoided saying God's name, not because he is unpleasant or embarrassing, but because he is holy.
--------------

There was a woman in that city //who many people knew had been// __a prostitute__ [EUP]. Luke 7:37a (TFT)

When Luke wrote this, he referred to the woman as __a sinner__. Since all people are sinners, it did not mean simply that she was a sinner, but that she was notably immoral. He may have used the word "sinner" as a euphemism for a prostitute. 
-------------------

They started talking with Jesus about how he //would accomplish what God had planned when he// __died__ [EUP] //very soon// in Jerusalem. Luke 9:31 (TFT)

Luke wrote of Jesus' "departure" as a euphemism for his death. It can be unpleasant to talk about death, so sometimes people use euphemisms that are not so harsh sounding.

----------------


//That is, he wants// each one of you to know how to control your own __sexual desires__ [EUP]. He wants you to live pure lives that all people will see as good. 1 Thes 4:4 (TFT)

When Paul wrote to the Thessalonians, he wrote about them controlling their own “bodies”. But what he probably meant is for them to control their sexual desires. Sometimes people feel embarrassed talking about sexual desires. For Paul, the word “bodies” was less embarrassing or offensive than a phrase like “sexual desires.” The TFT uses direct speech rather than the euphemism.
----------------

My fellow believers, we also want you to understand well [LIT] //what will happen// to our fellow believers //who now// __are dead__ [EUP]. 1 Thes 4:13a (TFT)

When Paul wrote to the Thessalonians, he wrote about fellow believers who were “asleep”. But what he meant is that they were dead. Sometimes people don't like to speak directly about death because it is unpleasant. For Paul, “asleep” was a more gentle way to speak about being dead. The TFT uses direct speech rather than the euphemism.
