====== [PRS] Personification ======


=== Personification is a kind of simile or metaphor, in which an idea or something that is not alive is referred to as if it were a person and could do the things people do or have the attributes people have. ===

Immediately the man was healed. He was no longer a leper [PRS]! Luke 5:13b (TFT)

Luke wrote that the leprosy left the sick man. People can leave and go somewhere else, but sicknesses don't leave a person and go somewhere else. So this is an example of personification. Another way to say this is "He no longer had leprosy."

But those who are //truly God's// children [PRS] realize that //what John and I do is truly// wise.‚Äù  Luke 7:35 (TFT)

Jesus said that wisdom is vindicated or proved right by her children. This was likely a proverb that was applicable to this situation. It is personification because wisdom is spoken of as though it were a woman that has children. This wisdom is God's wisdom, and wisdom's "children" are those who believe and follow wisdom. As a result of following God's wisdom they live wisely, and their wise behavior proves that God's wisdom is right. Jesus was probably saying that those who follow God's wisdom would follow what John and he were teaching, and their behavior would prove that John and he were teaching according to God's wisdom.

Because you have trusted [PRS] in me, God has saved you from the guilt of your sins. Luke 7:50 (TFT)

Jesus told a woman that her faith, or trust, in God had saved her. People can save people, but abstract ideas like faith can't save anyone. So this is an example of personification.

//But you, brothers and sisters, are not in the darkness for __the day to overtake you__ like a thief would.// 1 Thes 5:4, NET


//Just like people in darkness are unaware of what is happening around them, most people are not aware of what is about to happen to them // [MET, PRS]. //Just like a thief comes unexpectedly for people who are unaware, __that time of punishment will come on people__ when they are not expecting it // [SIM]. //But you, my fellow believers, are people who are very much aware // [LIT] //of what is going to happen. As a result, you will be expecting// [LIT] //those things to happen// [PRS]. 1 Thes 5:4, 5a, TFT


In this example of personification, the day or time of punishment is said to overtake people. A thief can overtake a person when that person is unaware and is not expecting him. In the same way, the time of punishment can happen at a time when people are unaware and not expecting it. Paul reminds the people that since they are aware, this will not happen to them.
