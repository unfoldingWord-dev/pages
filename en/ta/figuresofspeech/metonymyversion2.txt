====== [MTY] Metonymy [məˈtänəmē], Metonym [ˈmetəˌnim]======


=== In metonymy some thing or some idea is called not by its own name, but by the name of something associated with that thing or idea. A metonym is a word or phrase used as a substitute for something it is associated with. ===

**Examples from English** \\ 
"The pot is boiling" means "The water in the pot is boiling." \\ 
"The pen is mightier than the sword" means "Writing one's ideas and reasons is more effective than fighting." \\
"Could you give me a hand with this work?" means "Could you help me with this work?" \\

**Examples from the Bible**\\
 

God, the Lord, __will make him a___//__king__// [MTY] as his ancestor King David was. Luke 1:32 (TFT)

The angel told Mary that God would give her son David's throne. A throne represents the king's authority. When he said that God would give him David's throne, "throne" was a metonym for "kingship". God would give him kingship. That is, God would make him king.

He will be the King of //the Jews//, the descendants [MTY] of //your ancestor// Jacob, forever. Luke 1:33a (TFT)

The angel told Mary that her son would be king over Jacob's house. The word "house" is often used in the Bible as a metonym for "household", the people living in the house. This too can be a metonym for descendants. So "Jacob's house" in this verse refers to "Jacob's descendants".

---------------

… because they will hear about the things that God [MTY], the mighty one, has done for me. 
Luke 1:49a (TFT)

Mary said that the Mighty One had done great things for her. She did not say the word "God", but she referred to him in a way that described him. This, too, is metonymy.
------------

They tell us that now you wait expectantly for his Son //to return to earth// from heaven. You firmly believe that God caused him to live again after he died. You believe also that Jesus will rescue //all of// us, //who trust in him// from __God’s punishing us__. 1 Thes 1:10 (TFT)

Paul wrote that Jesus will deliver us from "the coming wrath". "The coming wrath" refers to God's punishment. Punishment is what God does because of his wrath.
------

Do not //refuse __the urging from God’s__//___Spirit__ //when he is working// [MTY] //among you//. //That would be like// throwing water on //a fire// [MET]. 1 Thes 5:19 (TFT)

Paul wrote not to extinguish God's Spirit. In this example of metonymy, the word "Spirit" refers to the "Spirit's urging". The Spirit is the one who does the urging. No one can quench or kill the Spirit himself. But we could quench his urging, or his working among us, by not obeying him.
