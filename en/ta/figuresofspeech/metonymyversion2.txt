====== [MTY] Metonymy [məˈtänəmē] ======


=== In metonymy some thing or some idea is called not by its own name, but by the name of something associated with that thing or idea. ===


Examples from the Bible\\
 
They tell us that now you wait expectantly for his Son //to return to earth// from heaven. You firmly believe that God caused him to live again after he died. You believe also that Jesus will rescue //all of// us, //who trust in him// from __God’s punishing us__. 1 Thes 1:10 (TFT)

Paul wrote that Jesus will deliver us from "the coming wrath". "The coming wrath" refers to God's punishment. Punishment is what God does because of his wrath.
------

Do not //refuse __the urging from God’s__//___Spirit__ //when he is working// [MTY] //among you//. //That would be like// throwing water on //a fire// [MET]. 1 Thes 5:19 (TFT)

Paul wrote not to extinguish God's Spirit. In this example of metonymy, the word "Spirit" refers to the "Spirit's urging". The Spirit is the one who does the urging. No one can quench or kill the Spirit himself. But we could quench his urging, or his working among us, by not obeying him.
