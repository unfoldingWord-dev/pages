====== [IRO] Irony [ˈīrənē, ˈiərnē] ======


=== In irony, a speaker repeats what someone has (or could have) said or thought, and he communicates indirectly that he does not agree with it. ===


**Examples from English** 


"The used-car salesman told me that this car was a great bargain at only $1000 so I bought it. But now I find out that the radiator doesn't work and it will cost me $4000 to get it repaired. __Great bargain. Yeah, right__." (In this example, the speaker expresses his annoyance that what the car salesman said wasn't true.")


"Thanks for holding the door open for me." (If someone says this to someone who did not hold the door open for him, he expresses that the other person should have been kind enough to hold it open, and that he is annoyed with that person for not doing that.)


**Examples from the Bible** 


//When Jesus heard this he said to them, “Those who are healthy don't need a physician, but those who are sick do. I have not come to call __the righteous__, but sinners.”// Mark 2:17, NET


//After Jesus heard what they were saying, he said to the men who taught the Jewish laws, “People who consider that they are well do not seek a doctor. On the contrary, it is those who are sick who seek a doctor // [MET]!” //This he said to indicate that it was those who knew that they had sinned who were coming to him in order that he might help them spiritually. And he said, “I did not come to invite __people who think that__ // [IRO] //__they are righteous__ to come to me and turn from their sinful behavior. On the contrary, I came from heaven to invite people who know that they are sinners, in order that they might turn from their sins and come to me.//” Mark 2:17, TFT


The experts in the law and the Pharisees thought that they were righteous, and they criticized Jesus for letting sinners follow him. They thought that only righteous people like themselves should be allowed to follow him. Jesus knew that they were not truly righteous–-that they really were sinners. But he used their way of describing themselves and spoke of “the righteous” so that they would know that he was talking about them, and he showed that he did not consider them to be truly righteous when he said that he had not come to call them.

//He also said to them, “You __neatly__ reject the commandment of God in order to set up your tradition.// Mark 7:9, NET


//Jesus also said to them, “__You think__ // [IRO]//__that you are clever__ in refusing to do what God commanded just so that you can obey your own traditions!// Mark 7:9, TFT


Instead of obeying God’s commands that were recorded in the scriptures, the Pharisees and experts in the law had came up with religious traditions that would make them appear righteous. Jesus rebuked them for this by reflecting back to them their proud attitude regarding God’s commands and their traditions.
