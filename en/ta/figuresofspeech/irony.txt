====== [IRO] Irony [ˈīrənē, ˈiərnē] ======


=== In irony, a speaker repeats what someone has (or could have) said or thought, and he communicates indirectly that he does not agree with it. ===


**Examples from English** 


"The used-car salesman told me that this car was a great bargain at only $1000 so I bought it. But now I find out that the radiator doesn't work and it will cost me $4000 to get it repaired. __Great bargain. Yeah, right__." (In this example, the speaker expresses his annoyance that what the car salesman said wasn't true.")


"Thanks for holding the door open for me." (If someone says this to someone who did not hold the door open for him, he expresses that the other person should have been kind enough to hold it open, and that he is annoyed with that person for not doing that.)


**Examples from the Bible** 


//When Jesus heard this he said to them, “Those who are healthy don't need a physician, but those who are sick do. I have not come to call __the righteous__, but sinners.”// Mark 2:17, NET


//After Jesus heard what they were saying, he said to the men who taught the Jewish laws, “People who consider that they are well do not seek a doctor. On the contrary, it is those who are sick who seek a doctor // [MET]!” //This he said to indicate that it was those who knew that they had sinned who were coming to him in order that he might help them spiritually. And he said, “I did not come to invite __people who think that__ // [IRO] //__they are righteous__ to come to me and turn from their sinful behavior. On the contrary, I came from heaven to invite people who know that they are sinners, in order that they might turn from their sins and come to me.//” Mark 2:17, TFT


The people who taught the Jewish laws that that they were righteous and that Jesus should let only them go to him. They did not think that Jesus should let sinners go to him. But Jesus knew that no one is righteous, and that all people need to go to him and turn away from their sins. Since people who think that they are righteous don’t think that they need to turn from their sins, Jesus said that he did not invite the “righteous” people to go to him but sinners. Jesus used irony when he said “righteous”; he spoke as if there really were righteous people, even though he knew that there weren’t any. The people who thought that they were righteous could understand that he was referring to them and that he was not inviting them as long as they thought that they were righteous and that they did not need to turn from their sins.

//He also said to them, “You __neatly__ reject the commandment of God in order to set up your tradition.// Mark 7:9, NET


//Jesus also said to them, “__You think__ // [IRO] //__that you are clever__ in refusing to do what God commanded just so that you can obey your own traditions!// Mark 7:9, TFT


Instead of obeying God’s commands that were recorded in the scriptures, the Pharisees and experts in the law had made up religious traditions that would be convenient to themselves, but would also make them appear to be righteous followers of God's commands. Jesus rebuked them, saying that they "neatly" or "cleverly" refuse to do what God commanded. The fact that he said that they refused to obey God's commands shows that it was a rebuke. By saying that they did it "cleverly", he showed them that he knew that they thought they were clever and that he saw their proud attitude.
