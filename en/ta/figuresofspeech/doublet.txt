====== [DOU] Doublet [ˈdəblət] ======


=== A doublet states the same thought in two ways. ===


Prepare the way for the Lord,\\ 
make his paths straight. Mark 1:3b, NET


//As people straighten out pathways before an important official arrives// [MET],\\ 
//make yourselves ready // [DOU] //in order that you will be prepared when the Lord comes.”// Mark 1:3b (TFT)


----


But as the man went out he began to __announce it publicly__ and __spread the story widely__, Mark 1:45a NET


//The man went and presented himself to the priest. But then he began to __tell many people__ about how Jesus had healed him// [DOU]. Mark 1:45a (TFT)


----


For nothing is hidden except to be revealed,\\ 
and nothing is concealed except to be brought to light. Mark 4:22, NET


//Similarly, there are some parts of God's message that people do not know. But he intends that people will understand all the things that they do not know now.// Mark 4:22, TFT
