====== [SIM] Simile [ˈsiməlē] ======


=== In simile something is compared to something else of a different kind in order to focus on a particular trait that they both have in common. The fact that there is a comparison is stated clearly with ‘like’ or ‘as’. ===


As you know, we treated each of you __as a father treats his own children__. 1 Thes 2:11, NET


//You know also that we lovingly behaved/acted toward each one of you __as a father lovingly behaves/acts toward his own children__ // [SIM]//.// Thes 2:11 (NET)


In this example of simile, Paul compares his behavior to that of a father. He was not the father of the Thessalonian Christians, they were not children, and he was not raising them in his home. But he was loving and gentle toward them as he taught them about God and about how to live in obedience to God just as a father is loving and gentle toward his children and teaches them.
