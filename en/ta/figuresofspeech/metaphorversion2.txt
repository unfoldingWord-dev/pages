====== [MET] Metaphor [ˈmetəˌfôr, ˈmetəˌfər] ======


=== In a metaphor something is said to be something else of a different kind in order to focus on a particular trait that they both have in common. Like simile, this involves a comparison, but the words ‘like’ and ‘as’ are not used to show it. ===


**Examples from English** 

**Examples from the Bible**
Just like a new day begins when the sun rises [MET], 
God will do that new thing for us when the Messiah comes to us from heaven. Luke 1:78 (TFT)


**1 Thessalonians 4:9** \\ 
//Now on the topic of __brotherly__ love you have no need for anyone to write you, for you yourselves are taught by God to love one another. NET\\ 
I want to urge you again that you should love your __fellow believers__.// TFT


In this metaphor, fellow believers are called brothers probably because of the love they should have for one another just as brothers should.

**1 Thessalonians 5:19** \\ 
//Do not __extinguish the Spirit__.// NET\\ 
//Do not r__efuse the urging from God’s Spirit__ when he is working among you. That would be like throwing water on a fire. // TFT


In this metaphor, refusing to obey the urging of God’s Spirit is referred to as extinguishing the Spirit, because refusing to obey him keeps him from working in our lives just as throwing water on a fire extinguishes it and stops it from burning.\\ 
In the TFT this metaphor is translated as a simile with the word ‘like’ in “That would be like throwing water on a fire.”
