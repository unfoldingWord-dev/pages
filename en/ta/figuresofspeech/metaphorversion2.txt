====== [MET] Metaphor [ˈmetəˌfôr, ˈmetəˌfər] ======


=== In a metaphor something is said to be something else of a different kind in order to focus on a particular trait that they both have in common. Like simile, this involves a comparison, but the words ‘like’ and ‘as’ are not used to show it. ===

**Examples from English** \\ 
Her __heart was broken__ when her husband left her. (Her emotions are compared to a physical thing that could break.) \\ 
His __temper flared__ when she insulted him. (His anger is compared to a fire.) \\ 


**Examples from the Bible**\\

Just like a new day begins when the sun rises [MET], 
God will do that new thing for us when the Messiah comes to us from heaven. Luke 1:78 (TFT)

Zechariah said that the rising (sun) would visit us from on high. This is a metaphor for the Messiah coming from heaven to his people.
---------------------

People who do not know God [MET] are like those who sit in the darkness. 
… But when the Messiah tells us God's message, 
it will be like causing such people to see a bright light. Luke 1:79 (TFT)

Zechariah said that the sun would shine on those who sat in the darkness. The sun shining is a metaphor for the Messiah telling God's message. Sitting in darkness is a metaphor for not knowing God.
--------------------

//God is ready to punish you if you do not turn away from your sinful behavior, just like a man// [MET] lays his axe at the roots //of a fruit// tree to chop it down and throw it into the fire if it does not produce good fruit [MET].” Luke 3:9 (TFT)

A man chopping down a fruit tree that does not bear good fruit is a metaphor for God punishing people who live sinful lives. John was saying that just as a man puts his axe to a tree's roots when he is about to chop it down, God was about to punish his people.
--------------------

//I want to urge you// again //that you should// love //your// __fellow believers__. 1 Thessalonians 4:9 (TFT)

Paul reminded the people to have "brotherly love" for one another. "Brother" is a metaphor fellow believers, probably because the believers' love for one another should be like the kind of love brothers have for one another.

----

Do not //refuse the urging from God’s// Spirit //when he is working// [MTY] //among you. That would be like// __throwing water on //a fire//__ [MET]. 1 Thessalonians 5:19 (TFT)

Paul wrote not to extinguish or put out the Spirit. In this metaphor, Paul compares God's Spirit, or the urging of God's Spirit, to a fire. And he compares refusing to obey the Spirit's urging to putting out a fire.  Refusing to obey the Spirit's urging keeps him from working in our lives just as throwing water on a fire extinguishes it and stops it from burning.\\ 
In the TFT this metaphor is translated as a simile with the word ‘like’ in “That would be like throwing water on a fire.”
