====== [MET] Metaphor [ˈmetəˌfôr, ˈmetəˌfər] ======


=== In a metaphor something is said to be something else of a different kind in order to focus on a particular trait that they both have in common. Like simile, this involves a comparison, but the words ‘like’ and ‘as’ are not used to show it. ===


**Examples from English** 

**Examples from the Bible**\\

Just like a new day begins when the sun rises [MET], 
God will do that new thing for us when the Messiah comes to us from heaven. Luke 1:78 (TFT)

Zechariah said that the rising (sun) would visit us from on high. This is a metaphor for the Messiah coming from heaven to his people.
--------------------

People who do not know God [MET] are like those who sit in the darkness. 
… But when the Messiah tells us God's message, 
it will be like causing such people to see a bright light. Luke 1:79

Zechariah said that the sun would shine on those who sat in the darkness. The sun shining is a metaphor for the Messiah telling God's message. Sitting in darkness is a metaphor for not knowing God.

**1 Thessalonians 4:9** \\ 
//Now on the topic of __brotherly__ love you have no need for anyone to write you, for you yourselves are taught by God to love one another. NET\\ 
I want to urge you again that you should love your __fellow believers__.// TFT


In this metaphor, fellow believers are called brothers probably because of the love they should have for one another just as brothers should.

----

Do not //refuse the urging from God’s// Spirit //when he is working// [MTY] //among you. That would be like// __throwing water on //a fire//__ [MET]. 1 Thessalonians 5:19 (TFT)

Paul wrote not to extinguish or put out the Spirit. In this metaphor, Paul compares God's Spirit, or the urging of God's Spirit, to a fire. And he compares refusing to obey the Spirit's urging to putting out a fire.  Refusing to obey the Spirit's urging keeps him from working in our lives just as throwing water on a fire extinguishes it and stops it from burning.\\ 
In the TFT this metaphor is translated as a simile with the word ‘like’ in “That would be like throwing water on a fire.”
