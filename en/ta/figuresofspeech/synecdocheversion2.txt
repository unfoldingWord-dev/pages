====== [SYN] Synecdoche [siˈnekdəkē] ======


=== In synecdoche something is called not by its own name, but the name of a part of that thing or the name of something that the thing is a part of. ===

He will cause parents [SYN] to act //peacefully// toward their children //again//.... Luke 1:17b (TFT)

The angel told Zechariah that his son would cause __fathers__ to act peacefully toward their children. He used the word "fathers" to refer to both parents.

//We constantly [​HYP] and fervently/earnestly ask God that we will be able to __visit__ you [SYN] and that we will be able to help you to trust in Christ/God more strongly.// 1 Thes 3:10 (TFT)

Paul wrote that he and his friends were praying that they might __see__ the Thessalonians. He meant that he wanted to __visit__ them. Seeing each other is one thing that people do when they visit each other. So here a part 'see' was used to refer to the whole 'visit'.
