====== [HYP] Hyperbole [hīˈpərbəlē] ======


=== A hyperbole is a deliberate exaggeration used to indicate the speaker’s feeling or opinion about something. ===


**Examples from English** 


"I’ve told you __a million times__ not to do that" means "I've told you __too many times__ not to do that."\\ 
"I’m __starving__. I haven’t eaten anything since early morning" means "I'm too hungry. I want something to eat now. I haven't eaten since early morning."\\ 
"It took __forever__ for him to finish the job" means "It took him too long to finish the job."\\ 

**Examples from the Bible** 

__many people__ [HYP] whose //friends or relatives// were sick or who had various diseases brought them to Jesus. Luke 4:40 (TFT)

Luke wrote that __all__ brought their sick ones to Jesus. This is a hyperbole. Probably not everyone did this. But many did.

-----------------------------

//In general//, __most people__ will [HYP] hate you because //you believe in// me [MTY]. Luke 21:17 (TFT)

When Jesus said that "everyone" would hate his followers, he meant that most people would hate his followers. He said “everyone” to emphasize how difficult things would be for his followers.

---------------

//If your hand causes you to sin, __cut it off__.// Mark 9:43a, NET


//So,// if you are //wanting to use one of// [MTY, PRS] //your hands to sin, stop using your hand! Even if you have to// __cut your hand off__ and throw it away //to avoid sinning, do it// [HYP]! Mark 9:43a, TFT


Jesus used exaggeration when he said to cut off the hand in order to show how important it is to do whatever we need to do in order not to sin.
