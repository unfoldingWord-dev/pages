====== [HYP] Hyperbole [hīˈpərbəlē] ======


=== A hyperbole is a deliberate exaggeration used to indicate the speaker’s feeling or opinion about something. ===


For from you the message of the Lord has echoed forth not just in Macedonia and Achaia, but in __every place__ reports of your faith in God have spread, so that we do not need to say anything. 1 Thes 1:8, NET


//Other people have heard you tell the message from the Lord Jesus. Then they also have proclaimed the message to people who live throughout Macedonia and Achaia provinces. Not only that, but people who live in __many far-away places__ [HYP] have heard that you trust in God. As a result, we do not need to tell people what God has done in your lives.// 1 Thes 1:8 (TFT)


In this example of hyperbole ‘many far away places’ is referred to as ‘every place’. Paul did not mean that in every single place people had heard reports of their faith, but it was exciting that they were hearing reports from many places.

It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle\\ 
than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God. Mark 10:25, NET\\ 
It is impossible for a camel to go through the eye of a needle. \\ 
It is almost as difficult [HYP] for rich people to decide to let God rule their lives. Mark 10:25

//So, if you are wanting to use one of// [MTY, PRS] //your hands to sin, stop using your hand! Even if you have to __cut your hand off and throw it away__ to avoid sinning, do it// [HYP]! Mark 9:43a, TFT


Jesus told people to __cut off their hand__ if it caused them to sin. He meant that they we should do whatever we need to do in order not to sin. He used this hyperbole to show how extremely important it is to stop sinning.

//__In general__, you will be hated by __most__// [HYP] //people {__most__// [HYP] //people will hate you} because you believe in me//. Mark 13:13a (TFT)


Jesus said that "everyone" would hate his followers. This was hyperbole. He meant that "most people" would hate his followers. He said “everyone” to emphasize how difficult things would be for his followers.
