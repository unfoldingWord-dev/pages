====== [HYP] Hyperbole [hīˈpərbəlē] ======


=== A hyperbole is a deliberate exaggeration used to indicate the speaker’s feeling or opinion about something. ===


For from you the message of the Lord has echoed forth not just in Macedonia and Achaia, but in every place reports of your faith in God have spread, so that we do not need to say anything. 1 Thes 1:8, NET


Other people have heard you tell the message from the Lord Jesus. Then they also have proclaimed the message to people who live throughout Macedonia and Achaia provinces. Not only that, but people who live in many far-away places [HYP] have heard that you trust in God. As a result, we do not need to tell people what God has done in your lives. 1 Thes 1:8, TFT


In this example of hyperbole ‘many far away places’ is referred to as ‘every place’. Paul did not mean that in every single place people had heard reports of their faith, but it was exciting that they were hearing reports from many places.\\ 
And indeed you are practicing it toward all the brothers and sisters in all of Macedonia... 1 Thes 4:10a, NET


and because you already are showing that you love your fellow believers [HYP] who live in other places in your province of Macedonia ... 1 Thes 4:10a, TFT


This verse appears to have two cases of hyperbole. The people of Thessalonica were probably not showing love to every fellow believer, and they probably were not showing love to believers in every part of Macedonia, but Paul was delighted that they were showing love to many people throughout the province of Macedonia.
