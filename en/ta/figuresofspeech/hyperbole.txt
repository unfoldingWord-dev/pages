====== [HYP] Hyperbole [hīˈpərbəlē] ======


=== A hyperbole is a deliberate exaggeration used to indicate the speaker’s feeling or opinion about something. ===


**Examples from the Bible** 


//If your hand causes you to sin, __cut it off__.// Mark 9:43a, NET


//So, if you are wanting to use one of// [MTY, PRS] //your hands to sin, stop using your hand! Even if you have to __cut your hand off__ and throw ////it away to avoid sinning, do it // [HYP]! Mark 9:43a, TFT


Jesus used exaggeration when he said to cut off the hand in order to show how important it is to do whatever we need to do in order not to sin.

//You will be hated by __everyone__ because of my name.// Mark 13:13a, NET


//In general, you will be hated by __most [HYP] people__ {most [HYP] people will hate you} because you believe in me.// Mark 13:13a, TFT


When Jesus said that everyone would hate his followers, he meant that most people would hate his followers. He said “everyone” to emphasize how difficult things would be for his followers.
