====== [HEN] Hendiadys [henˈdīədəs] ======


=== In hendiadys a single idea is expressed with two words connected with “and,” when one word could be used to modify the other. ===

**Example from Luke 21:15a**\\
because I will __make you wise__ [HEN] so that you will //know// __what to say__.\\

Jesus said that he would give them "a mouth and wisdom". This is an example of hendiadys. The word "mouth" here refers to "words," and the phrase could be translated as "wise words" or "words of wisdom", with "wise" or "of wisdom" modifying "words".

**Example from 1 Thes 2:12**\\ 
//… exhorting and encouraging you and insisting that you live in a way worthy of God who calls you to his own kingdom and his glory.// NET


//We encouraged you, we urged you, and we insisted that you live good lives for God who calls you to his glorious kingdom. // CEV


//Specifically, we kept strongly exhorting/urging and encouraging you that you conduct your lives in the way that God’s people should, because he has invited you to become his people over whom he will wonderfully rule [HEN].//TFT


In this example of hendiadys, God’s glorious kingdom, or his wonderfully ruling over his people, is expressed as two nouns connected with “and” in “his own kingdom and his glory”. HIs kingdom and his glory are not two separate things that God calls us into. Rather his kingdom is glorious.
