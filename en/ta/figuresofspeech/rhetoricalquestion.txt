====== [RHQ] Rhetorical Question ======


=== A rhetorical question is a question that is used for something other than getting information. Often it indicates the speaker’s attitude toward the topic or the listener. ===


**Examples from the Bible** 


For we wanted to come to you … For who is our hope or joy or crown to boast of before our Lord Jesus at his coming? Is it not of course you? 1 Thes 2:18, 19, NET


//We were strongly desiring to be with you, because __truly you __//[RHQ] //__are the ones about whom we are proud and are joyful!__ It is because we are confident that you will remain faithful/continue believing in God that we will be joyful. __You are the ones that we confidently expect __ will keep strongly trusting in God! I__t is because you will remain faithful/continue believing in God that we will be proud of the work that we have done__//[MET, RHQ] //when our Lord Jesus examines what we all have done, at the time when he comes back to earth//! 1 Thes 2:19, TFT


In the verse above, Paul used the first rhetorical question with the word “who” to help the Thessalonians focus on the fact that they were the ones that he was so proud and joyful about. Then to emphasize that even more, he answered his rhetorical question with another rhetorical question whose answer is obviously “Yes, the Thessalonians are the ones.”
