====== [PRS] Personification ======


=== Personification is a kind of simile or metaphor, in which an idea or something that is not alive is referred to as if it were a person and could do the things people do or have the attributes people have. ===


//But you, brothers and sisters, are not in the darkness for __the day to overtake you__ like a thief would.// 1 Thes 5:4


//Just like people in darkness are unaware of what is happening around them, most people are not aware of what is about to happen to them // [MET, PRS]. //Just like a thief comes unexpectedly for people who are unaware, __that time of punishment will come on people__ when they are not expecting it // [SIM]. //But you, my fellow believers, are people who are very much aware // [LIT] //of what is going to happen. As a result, you will be expecting// [LIT] //those things to happen// [PRS]. 1 Thes 5:4, 5a


In this example of personification, the day or time of punishment is said to overtake people. A thief can overtake a person when that person is unaware and is not expecting him. In the same way, the time of punishment can happen at a time when people are unaware and not expecting it. Paul reminds the people that they are aware, so this will not happen to them.
