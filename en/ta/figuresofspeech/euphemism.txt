====== [EUP] Euphemism [ˈyo͞ofəˌmizəm] ======


=== A euphemism is a mild or polite way of referring to something that is unpleasant or embarrassing. ===


**Some examples from English:**\\ 
“Adult beverages” refers to “beer or liquor.”\\ 
“He passed away” and “He departed” means “He died.”\\ 
“He slept with her” usually means “They had sexual relations with each other.”\\ 
“Bathroom” and “restroom” refer to a room that has a toilet in it.


**Examples from the Bible** 

There was a woman in that city //who many people knew had been// __a prostitute__ [EUP]. Luke 7:37a (NET)

When Luke wrote this, he referred to the woman as a sinner. Since all people are sinners, it did not mean simply that she was a sinner, but that she was notably immoral. This may have been a euphemism for a prostitute. 

-------------------


//... that each of you know how to __possess his own body__ in holiness and honor,// 1 Thes 4:4, NET


//That is, he wants each one of you to know how to __control your own sexual desires__// [EUP]. //He wants you to live pure lives that all people will see as good. // 1 Thes 4:4, TFT


In this example of euphemism, controlling one’s sexual desires is spoken of as possessing one’s own body. This is because it can be embarrassing to speak directly of sexual desires.

//Now we do not want you to be uninformed, brothers and sisters, about those who are __asleep__ ...// 1 Thes 4:13a, NET


//My fellow believers, we also want you to understand well// [LIT] //what will happen to our fellow believers who now are __dead__//[EUP]. 1 Thes 4:13a, TFT


In this example of euphemism, being dead is spoken of as being asleep. This is because death can be an unpleasant thing to talk about.
