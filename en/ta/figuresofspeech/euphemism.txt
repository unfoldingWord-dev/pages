====== [EUP] Euphemism [ˈyo͞ofəˌmizəm] ======


=== A euphemism is a mild or indirect way of referring to something that is unpleasant or embarrassing. ===


==== Example: 1 Thes 4:4 ====


//… that each of you know how to __possess his own body__ in holiness and honor,// 1 Thes 4:4, NET


//That is, he wants each one of you to know how to __control your own sexual desires__ [EUP]. He wants you to live pure lives that all people will see as good. // 1 Thes 4:4, TFT


In this example of euphemism, controlling one’s sexual desires is spoken of as possessing one’s own body. This is because it can be embarrassing to speak directly of sexual desires.


==== Example: 1 Thes 4:13a ====


//Now we do not want you to be uninformed, brothers and sisters, about those who __are asleep__, …//NET


//My fellow believers, we also want you to understand well [LIT] what will happen to our fellow believers who now __are dead__ [EUP].// TFT


In this example of euphemism, being dead is spoken of as being asleep. This is because death can be an unpleasant thing to talk about.
