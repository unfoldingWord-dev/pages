====== [IRO] Irony [ˈīrənē, ˈiərnē] ======


=== In irony, a speaker repeats what someone has (or could have) said or thought, but he expects the listeners to understand from the context that he does not agree with it. ===


**Examples from English** 


"The used-car salesman told me that this car was a great bargain at only $1000 so I bought it. But now I find out that the radiator doesn't work and it will cost me $4000 to get it repaired. __Great bargain. Yeah, right__." (In this example, the speaker expresses his annoyance that what the car salesman said wasn't true.")


"Thanks for holding the door open for me." (If someone says this to someone who did not hold the door open for him, he expresses that the other person should have been kind enough to hold it open, and that he is annoyed with that person for not doing that.)


**Examples from the Bible** 


//After Jesus heard what they were saying, he said to the men who taught the Jewish laws, “People who consider that they are well do not seek a doctor. On the contrary, it is those who are sick who seek a doctor // [MET]!” //This he said to indicate that it was those who knew that they had sinned who were coming to him in order that he might help them spiritually. And he said, “I did not come to invite __people who think that__//[IRO] //__they are righteous__to come to me and turn from their sinful behavior. On the contrary, I came from heaven to invite people who know that they are sinners, in order that they might turn from their sins and come to me.//” Mark 2:17 (TFT)


The people who taught the Jewish laws thought that they were righteous people, and they criticized Jesus for letting sinners follow him. They thought that only righteous people like themselves should be allowed to follow him. But Jesus knew that no one is righteous–not even those who taught the Jewish laws. Jesus wanted people to repent from their sins and follow him. So he said that he did not come to invite righteous people to follow him. He spoke as if it were true that some people were righteous, but the fact that he was not inviting them to follow him showed that he did not truly consider them to be righteous.

//Jesus also said to them, “__You think__// [IRO] //__that you are clever__ ​ in refusing to do what God commanded just so that you can obey your own traditions!// Mark 7:9 (TFT)


Instead of obeying God’s commands that were recorded in the scriptures, the Pharisees and experts in the law had came up with religious traditions that would be convenient to themselves, but would also make them appear to be righteous followers of God's commands. Jesus rebuked them, saying that they "cleverly" refuse to do what God commanded. The fact that he said that they refused to obey God's commands shows that it was a rebuke. By saying that they did that "cleverly", he showed them that he knew that they thought they were clever and that he saw their proud attitude.
