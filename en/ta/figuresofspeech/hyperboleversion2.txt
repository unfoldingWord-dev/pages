**Examples from the Bible** 


//Other people have heard you tell the message from the Lord Jesus. Then they also have proclaimed the message to people who live throughout Macedonia and Achaia provinces. Not only that, but people who live in __many far-away places__//[HYP]//have heard that you trust in God. As a result, we do not need to tell people what God has done in your lives. // 1 Thes 1:8 (TFT)


//Paul wrote that people __in every ____place__were talking about the Thessalonians. This is an example of hyperbole. He meant that people in “many far away places” were talking about them. Paul probably used this hyperbole to show how happy he was that the Thessalonians' faith in God was so great that many people had heard about it.//

//So, if you are wanting to use one of// [MTY, PRS] //your hands to sin, stop using your hand! __Even if you have to cut your hand off and throw it away__ to avoid sinning, do it// [HYP]! Mark 9:43a, TFT


Jesus told people to cut off their hand if it caused them to sin. He meant that they we should do whatever we need to do in order not to sin. He used this hyperbole to show how extremely important it is to stop sinning.

//__In general__, you will be hated by __most__ // [HYP] people {__most__ [HYP]//people will hate you} because you believe in me//. Mark 13:13a (TFT)


Jesus said that “everyone” would hate his followers. This was hyperbole. He meant that “most people” would hate his followers. He said “everyone” to emphasize how difficult things would be for his followers.
