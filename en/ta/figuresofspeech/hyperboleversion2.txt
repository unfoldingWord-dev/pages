====== [HYP] Hyperbole [hīˈpərbəlē] ======


=== A hyperbole is a deliberate exaggeration used to indicate the speaker’s feeling or opinion about something. ===


**Examples from English** 

“I’ve told you __a million times__ not to do that” means “I've told you __too many__ times not to do that.”\\ 
“I’m __starving__. I haven’t eaten anything since early morning” means “I'm __too hungry__. I want something to eat now. I haven't eaten since early morning.” \\ 
“It took __forever__ for him to finish the job” means “It took him __too long__ to finish the job.”

**Examples from the Bible** 

__many people__ [HYP] whose //friends or relatives// were sick or who had various diseases brought them to Jesus. Luke 4:40 (TFT)

Luke wrote that __all__ brought their sick ones to Jesus. This is a hyperbole. Probably not everyone did this. But many did.
--------------


So after they brought the boats to the shore, they left __their business__ [HYP] //in the hands of others// and went with Jesus. Luke 5:11 (TFT)

Luke wrote that when Jesus invited some fishermen to follow him, they left everything. We know that they left their fishing business. Saying that they left "everything" may be a case of hyperbole to emphasize that now they were completely committed to following Jesus.
---------------------

//In general//, __most people__ will [HYP] hate you because //you believe in// me [MTY]. Luke 21:17 (TFT)

When Jesus said that "everyone" would hate his followers, he meant that most people would hate his followers. He said “everyone” to emphasize how difficult things would be for his followers.
-------------------------

//So,// if you are //wanting to use one of// [MTY, PRS] //your hands to sin, stop using your hand! Even if you have to// __cut your hand off__ and throw it away //to avoid sinning, do it// [HYP]! Mark 9:43a (TFT)

Jesus told people to cut off their hand if it caused them to sin. He meant that they we should do whatever we need to do in order not to sin. He used this hyperbole to show how extremely important it is to stop sinning.
------------------

//__In general__,// you will be hated by __most__  [HYP] people {__most__ [HYP] people will hate you} because //you believe in// me. Mark 13:13a (TFT)

Jesus said that “everyone” would hate his followers. This was hyperbole. He meant that “most people” would hate his followers. He said “everyone” to emphasize how difficult things would be for his followers.
------------------

… Not only that, but //people who live// in __many far-away places__ [HYP] have heard that you trust in God…. 1 Thes 1:8b (TFT)

Paul wrote that people __in every ____place__were talking about the Thessalonians. This is an example of hyperbole. He meant that people in “many far away places” were talking about them. Paul probably used this hyperbole to show how happy he was that the Thessalonians' faith in God was so great that many people had heard about it.
