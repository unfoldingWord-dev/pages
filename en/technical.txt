====== Technical Information ======

Door43 runs on [[https://www.dokuwiki.org|DokuWiki]], which is basically an open-source, web-based, text editor (no database), that provides revision-control and user management. Because of the document-centric nature of the platform, the entire filesystem tree of text (and media) files can be easily exported, converted to other formats, and used offline.

===== User Manual =====

The DokuWiki [[https://www.dokuwiki.org/manual|manual]] has more information about the software.

===== Tracking Changes =====

Tracking changes on the wiki is easily accomplished using DokuWiki's robust [[https://www.dokuwiki.org/rss|feed generator]].
