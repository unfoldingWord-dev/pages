====== How to Get Started ======


Translating content in Door43 is easy! Follow these simple steps to get started:


===== 1. Create an Account & Log in to Door43 =====


To start translating content, you will need a user account on Door43. If you do not have an account, [[:en:get-started?do=register|create one]] then you can [[:en:get-started?do=login|login]].


===== 2. Edit a (Test) Page =====


Door43 has a [[:playground:playground|test page]] that you can freely edit to try things out.


**Graphical Editor** – When you click the "Edit this page" button, you will probably see an edit window that looks like a simplified word processor. The buttons take care of formatting text and generally make it easier to use.


**Lightweight Editor** – If you prefer, you can click the "DW Edit" button beneath the edit box to switch to a very lightweight, text-based editor. This is the standard DokuWiki editor and it provides full control over the syntax of the text. //Note: when using the lightweight editor, you can switch back to the graphical editor by clicking the "FCK Edit" button.// 
===== 3. Choose a Resource =====


Browse to a resource you would like to translate. For instance, to translate the first story of [[:en:obs|Open Bible Stories]], you would click [[:en:obs:01|1. The Creation]].


===== 4. Choose a Language =====


In the sidebar, you should see a language selection dropdown. When you click it, you will see a list of available languages, sorted by [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639|language code]]. If you see the language into which you would like to translate, click it.((If you need a language added to Door43, please  [[http://distantshoresmedia/contact|contact us]])) 


**Source Text** – If the language you select does not have a source text already available on the page, you will see a header on the page that says "This page does not exist yet". You can save some time by starting with a source text from another language. Here's how:


    - Click the back button in your browser to return to the same page in the previous language.
    - Click the "Edit this page" button (or "View the page source").
    - Select all the text in the editing window.
    - Copy the text (Control-C).
    - Click the "Cancel" button to leave the edit box and return to the page view.
    - Choose your desired language in the language selection dropdown.
    - Click "Create this page".
    - Paste the contents of the original page into the edit box.


===== 5. Start Translating =====


Simply begin translating the source text into the language you selected.
