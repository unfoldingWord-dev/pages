====== Sacrifice ======


==== (sacrifice, burnt offering) ====


===== Definitions: =====


    * A sacrifice is an offering to God as a form of worship.
    * There were different kinds of sacrifices. These included sacrifices to ask God to forgive sin and sacrifices to thank Him for blessings.
    * Most sacrifices involved killing an animal and offering it to God as a gift.
    * Animal sacrifices could never truly make a person clean from his sin; only Jesus' perfect sacrifice of Himself can cleanse people from sin.
