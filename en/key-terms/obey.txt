====== obey ======

===== Definition: =====

To obey is to follow the law or to do what someone in authority commands.

    * When the law or someone in authority commands people to do something, they obey by doing it.
    * When the law or someone in authority commands people not to do something, they obey by not doing it.
  
The only person who completely obeyed God was Jesus Christ, and him alone. The opposite of "obey" is "disobey."
