====== power of God ======

==== (power of Jesus, power of the Holy Spirit) ====


===== Definition: =====

The "power of God" refers to his ability to do things that are not possible for people to do.

    * The word power can refer to the ability to do things or make things happen, physical strength, or authority to rule.
    * God is the source of all power--his power is never limited.
    * God is the highest authority, and has complete power over everything that he has created.
    * Any act that involves supernatural power, such as healing people or raising them from the dead, is done by the power of God.
    * "Miracles" are done by the power of God, and are sometimes translated as, "works of power."
    * Because Jesus and the Holy Spirit are also God, they have and use this same power.
