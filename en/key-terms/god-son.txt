====== God the Son ======


==== (term, other) ====


===== Facts: =====

  * The Son of God is Jesus, the one God chose to create, save, and rule the world.
  * His life comes from God the Father, so he is like his Father.
  * Unlike human sons, there was not a time when he did not exist. (That is, he has always existed.)
  * Human sons and daughters come into existence when their parents do a physical act that causes their conception.
  * The Son of God was already living when the Holy Spirit miraculously caused the body of God's Son to be conceived in a human woman's body.
  * Just as the son of human parents is a human being, the Son of God is God.
  * Because Jesus was born of a human mother, he is also a human being.
  * Because he is God's Son, he loves and obeys his Father, and his Father loves him.
