====== Covenant ======


==== (promise, covenant) ====


===== Definitions: =====


    * A covenant is a formal, binding agreement that must be fulfilled.
    * This agreement can be between people or between God and people.
    * Those who are in a covenant are obligated to do what they said they would do.
    * Sometimes both sides of the covenant are obligated, but other times it is only one person who promises to do something for someone else.

God made covenants with his people. A covenant could be conditional, (God would do His part only if they did their part) or unconditional, (God would do His part no matter what). \\
