====== Solomon ======


===== Facts: =====

  * Solomon was the son of King David; his mother was Bathsheba.
  * When Solomon became king, God told him to ask for anything he wanted and Solomon asked for wisdom to rule the people justly and well. God was pleased with Solomon and also gave him both wisdom and much wealth.
  * Although Solomon ruled wisely in the beginning years of his reign, later on he foolishly married many foreign women and started worshiping their gods.
