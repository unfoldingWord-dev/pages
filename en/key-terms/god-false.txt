==== (god, gods) ====


===== Definitions: =====

A god is something that people worship because they believe it has great power to affect their lives.

  * When god is written with a small 'g,' it refers to a false god, which is often an evil spirit.
  * People sometimes make idols as symbols of their false gods.
  * Evil spirits do not have any power of their own. Any power an evil spirit has comes from the one true God who created it.
  * When God is written with a capital 'G' it refers to the one and only true God.
