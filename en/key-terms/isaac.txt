====== Isaac ======


===== Facts: =====


    * Isaac was the son that God promised to give Abraham and Sarah even though they were very old.
    * God made his covenant with Abraham and promised to fulfill this covenant through Isaac.
    * God tested Abraham's faith by telling him to sacrifice Isaac.
    * Isaac's son Jacob had twelve sons. Their descendants later became the twelve tribes of the nation of Israel.
    * Isaac means “she laughs.” When God told Sarah that she would have a child, she was very old and could not believe what God said. So she laughed. And because of that, God told Abraham to name his son Isaac, meaning "she laughs".
