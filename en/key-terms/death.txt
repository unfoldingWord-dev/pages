===== Definitions: =====

=== 1. Physical death ===

  * Death is the point when the spirit of a person is separated from their body.
  * Death is the end of physical life. 
  * Disease and sickness, illness and accidents may lead to death, as well as old age or tragedies. 
  * Death also separates us from family and friends who know and love us. Death is a great and terrible enemy, but God defeated death when He raised Jesus Christ from the dead. Jesus overcame sin, death, and hell.

=== 2. Spiritual death ===

  * Spiritual death is the separation of a person from God.
  * Adam died spiritually when he disobeyed God. He became ashamed and tried to hide from God. 
  * Every descendent of Adam is a **[[:en:key-terms:sin|sinner]]**, and it spiritually dead. God can make us spiritually alive again, only by faith in Jesus Christ.

Note: "death" is the opposite of "**[[:en:key-terms:life|life]]**". In the Bible, physical and spiritual death are often compared and contrasted to physical and spiritual life.
