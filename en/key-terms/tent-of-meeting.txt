====== Tent of Meeting ======


==== (term, other) ====


===== Definitions: =====

When God gave his laws at Mount Sinai, he told the Israelites to make the Tent of Meeting. This was the holy place where he would meet with them. As they wandered through the wilderness, they would take it with them and set it up whenever God told them to.

  * They would set up a courtyard and put the Tent of Meeting and the altar in the courtyard. 
  * The people could go into the courtyard to give offerings and sacrifices to God.
  * The Tent of Meeting had two rooms; one in front and one in back.
  * The first room was very holy, so only the priests could go into it.
  * The second room was the most holy place, so only the high priest could go into it.
