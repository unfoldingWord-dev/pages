When God gave his laws at Mount Sinai, he told the Israelites to build the Tent of Meeting. This is where he would meet with them. As they wandered through the wilderness, they would take it with them and set it up whenever God told them to.

  * They would set up a courtyard and put the Tent of Meeting inside the courtyard. 
  * They would also put an altar in the courtyard.
  * The Tent of Meeting had two rooms; one in front and one in back.
  * The people could go into the courtyard to give offerings to God and to make sacrifices to him.
  * Only the priests could go into the actual tent.
