====== New Covenant ======


===== Definition: =====

  * God had made a covenant, or agreement, with Israel through His prophet Moses. Later God said that he would make a new covenant.
  * The New Covenant would be better than the old one because God would forgive his people's sins and they would obey him.
  * This New Covenant came into effect when God's Son died and came back to life.
  * The way people kept the old covenant was by obeying God's laws and making sacrifices. The way people keep the New Covenant is by trusting God to forgive us and save us because of Jesus' sacrificial death and his resurrection.
  * Because of the New Covenant, God writes his laws on our hearts. That means that he helps us to want to obey him.
