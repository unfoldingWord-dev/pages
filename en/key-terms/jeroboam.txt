====== Jeroboam ======


===== Facts: =====


    * Jeroboam led the ten northern Israelite tribes to rebel and separate from the southern two tribes.
    * Jeroboam became the first king over these ten tribes, which became known as the "kingdom of Israel."
    * King Jeroboam set up encouraged the tribes of northern Israel to worship idols.
    * Future kings of the northern tribes followed his evil example.


    * 


He also led the tribes of northern Israel to sin terribly by setting up idols for them to worship.


Change: He also led the tribes of northern kingdom of Israel to sin … –> He also led those tribes to sin …


I'm not sure which would be more helpful to repeat: '10/northern tribes' or 'kingdom of Israel' or 'northern kingdom'.


Maybe add link to kingdom-of-Israel
