====== Holy Spirit ======


==== (The Holy Spirit, God's Spirit, The Spirit of God, My Spirit) ====


===== Definitions: =====

The Holy Spirit is **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]**. The one true **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** exists eternally as three persons: **[[:en:key-terms:father-god|Father]]**, **[[:en:key-terms:son-god|Son]]**, and Holy Spirit. All three persons are equal in every way.

    * Because the Holy Spirit is **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]**, the Holy Spirit is absolutely holy, infinitely pure, and morally perfect in all His nature and in everything He does.
    * The Holy Spirit was active, along with the **[[:en:key-terms:father-god|Father]]** and the **[[:en:key-terms:son-god|Son]]**, in creating the world.
    * In the past the Holy Spirit sometimes came to people briefly to give them a special message or to enable them to do great things.
    * When **[[:en:key-terms:god|God's]]** **[[:en:key-terms:son-god|Son]]**, Jesus, returned to heaven, **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** sent the Holy Spirit to His people to lead them, teach them, comfort them and give them the ability to do **[[:en:key-terms:god|God's]]** will.
