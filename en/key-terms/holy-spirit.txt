====== Holy Spirit ======

====  (Holy Spirit, God's Spirit, Spirit of God, My Spirit) ====


===== Definitions: =====

  * A spirit has life and intelligence, but does not have a physical body as a human being does.
  * Because the Holy Spirit is God, he has life in himself and is absolutely pure and morally without flaw in all his nature and every action.
  * Some spirits, however, are evil and are opposed to God. They are referred to as “evil spirits” or “demons”; the devil is the chief evil spirit.
  * Angels are ministering spirits who serve God, but they are not divine. They are created beings.
  * The Spirit of God is equal to God the Father and God the Son in divinity, power, majesty, and authority.
