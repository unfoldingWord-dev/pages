====== Holy Spirit ======


==== (The Holy Spirit, God's Spirit, The Spirit of God, My Spirit) ====


===== Definitions: =====

The Holy Spirit is God. The one true God exists eternally as three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. All three persons are equal in every way.

    * Because the Holy Spirit is God, the Holy Spirit is absolutely holy, infinitely pure, and morally perfect in all His nature and in everything He does.
    * The Holy Spirit was active, along with the Father and the Son, in creating the world.
    * In the past the Holy Spirit sometimes came to people briefly to give them a special message or to enable them to do great things.
    * When God's Son, Jesus, returned to heaven, God sent the Holy Spirit to His people to lead them, teach them, comfort them and give them the ability to do God's will.
