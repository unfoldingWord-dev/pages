====== Christian ======


===== Definition: =====


After Jesus went back to heaven, people started calling his followers "Christians" because they were followers of Christ, which is another word for "Messiah."


    * A Christian is a person who follows Jesus. He believes that Jesus is the Son of God, and he trusts Jesus to save him from his sins.
    * People sometimes use the word "Christian" to refer to someone who just believes that the Christian religion is a good religion. This is not the meaning of "Christian" in the Bible.
    * In the Bible, "Christian" always refers to someone who truly believes in Jesus. For that reason, "Christians" are often called "believers."
