==== (kingdom of Judah, Judah) ====


===== Facts: =====

Judah was the largest of the twelve tribes of Israel. After King Solomon died, the Israelites split into two kingdoms: Israel and Judah. The kingdom of Judah was the southern kingdom, composed of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin.

  * The capital city of the kingdom of Judah was Jerusalem.
  * Some of the kings of the kingdom of Judah obeyed God and led the people to worship him. But many of Judah's kings were evil.
  * Over 120 years after Assyria defeated Israel (the northern kingdom), Judah was conquered by the nation of Babylon. The Babylonians destroyed the city and the Temple, and carried most of the people from the kingdom of Judah away to Babylon as captives.
  * After 70 years in exile in Babylon, some of the people were allowed to return to Jerusalem in Judah and rebuild the Temple and the city.
