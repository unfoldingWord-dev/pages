====== worship ======


==== (term, other) ====


===== Definitions: =====

  * To worship means to honor, praise and obey someone, especially God.
  * We worship God when we serve and honor him by praising him and obeying him.
  * In the Old Testament of the Bible, worshiping God often included sacrificing an animal on an altar. Now our worship of God does not include sacrificing animals. Instead we trust Jesus' sacrificial death to save us, and we submit our lives to His will.
  * Some people worship false gods.
