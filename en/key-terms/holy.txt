====== Holy ======


===== Definitions: =====

  * morally perfect, completely without sin. 
  * set apart by **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** for a special purpose, such as a priest who must be ceremonially cleansed of sin in order to serve God, or a place where God reveals Himself, such as “holy ground” or His temple.

Only God is absolutely holy. But He can make things and people holy. Through Jesus' blood, God cleanses us of our sin and credits Jesus' righteousness to us so that we appear before Him as morally perfect.
