====== tax collector ======


===== Definition: =====

Tax collectors receive the money that people owe the government and deliver it to the government.

    * The people who collected taxes for the Roman government would demand more money from the people than the government required. The tax collectors would keep the extra amount for themselves.
    * Because they cheated people, tax collectors were considered to be some of the worst sinners.
    * The Jews also considered tax collectors to be traitors because they worked for the foreign Roman government that ruled over the Jews in Israel.
