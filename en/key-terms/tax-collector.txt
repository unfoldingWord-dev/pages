====== tax collector ======


===== Definition: =====


    * A tax collector was someone who received money from people who were paying their taxes to the Roman government.
    * Most tax collectors would collect more money than was required by the government and would keep the extra amount for themselves.
    * Because they cheated people, tax collectors were considered to be some of the worst sinners.
    * The Jews also considered tax collectors to be traitors because they worked for the Roman government.


(or is it because they were Gentiles and considered unclean?)
