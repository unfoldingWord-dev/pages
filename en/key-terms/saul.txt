====== Saul ======


===== Facts: =====

Saul was an Israelite man whom God chose to become the first king of Israel.

  * Saul was tall and handsome, and a powerful soldier. He was the kind of person that the Israelites wanted to be their king.
  * Although he served God at first, he later became proud and disobeyed God. As a result, God appointed David to take Saul's place as king.

Hundreds of years later, there was another Jew named Saul, but his name was changed to Paul after he came to know Jesus.
