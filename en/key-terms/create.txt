<del> Information that will help the translator know more about the Hebrew or Greek term so they can apply their native language words correctly.


For example:


    * This term is best translated to have the meaning of…..
    * Perhaps compare/contrast/refer to other similar words or corresponding terms or Hebrew or Greek words </del>

  *The Hebrew Word בָּרָא/bārā (create) differs from other similar Hebrew words in that bārā highlights the inception or initiating thrust of that which is being created.
    *Therefore, the object of creation in frames 01-01 & 01-07 came to be due to God’s originative commands.
    *In frame 01-05 it is evident that God created the earth’s vegetation and He did so through His initiating command, “Let the earth produce all kinds of trees and plants.”
    *So, these examples of God’s creating show that, in some instances, God created objects from nothing (example, frame 01-01) and sometimes He was the inciting factor in using and sustaining natural means to create something new (example, frame 01-05). If the Biblical text is available to the translator, the context of the specific passage at hand should be observed.

  *Whenever the verb bārā is used in its most simple form (in the Qal) it is referring to the divine creating act of God.

  *Since this word carries the idea of causing something to exist, Christian orthodoxy since the time of Augustine has maintained the idea that the world was created out of nothing (there was no matter existent before creation)- that the world was made simply through the command of the Lord.
