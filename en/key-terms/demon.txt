====== demon ======

 
===== Definition: =====

Demons are spirit beings that opposes God's will.

  * God created spirit beings to serve him. Some rebelled against him and are called "demons." Those who continue to serve him are called "angels."
  * Demons and angels are both very powerful, but not as powerful as God who created them.
  * Sometimes demons attack people or try to control them. We call this, "demon-possession."
  * Demons sometimes use their power to make idols or false gods appear to be real.
  * The demons that Jesus encountered while he was on earth cause some people to be sick or weak, and others to be unnaturally strong.
  * Jesus gave his apostles power over the demons.
  * The demons know Jesus is the Messiah, and they fear him. 
  * When Jesus returns to earth, he will punish everyone who has rebelled against him, including the demons, Satan, and unbelievers.
  * Demon can also be translated as, "evil spirit."

The opposite of “demon” is an “angel.”
