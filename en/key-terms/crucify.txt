====== crucify ======


===== Definition: =====

To crucify someone is to tie him or hang him to a cross and leave him there to suffer and die in great pain.
 
  * People who were crucified died from either blood loss or suffocation. 
  * Crucifixion was a common method that the Roman Empire used to execute the worst criminals or people who had rebelled against the authority of Rome.
  * The Roman Empire used professional executioners to crucify people. These executioners made crucifixions as long and as painful as possible.
  * During the time of Jesus, Rome ruled the Jews and did not allow them to execute a criminal. When the Jewish religious leaders wanted to kill Jesus, they had to ask the Roman governor to order his soldiers to crucify Jesus.
  * The Romans crucified Jesus by nailing him to a cross. He suffered for six hours, and then died.
