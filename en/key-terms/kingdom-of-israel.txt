====== kingdom of Israel ======


===== Facts: =====

After King Solomon died, the Israelites split into two kingdoms. The kingdom of Israel was the northern kingdom, composed of ten of the tribes of Israel.

  * All of the kings of the kingdom of Israel were evil. They convinced the people to stop worshiping God at the Temple in Jerusalem, and to serve idols and false gods instead. So God eventually sent the Assyrians to attack them and to take many of them away as captives.
  * The Assyrians brought foreigners to live with the few remaining people of the kingdom of Israel. These foreigners intermarried with the Israelites, and their descendants became the Samaritan people.
