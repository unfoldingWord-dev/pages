====== preach ======


===== Definition: =====

To speak to a group of people, teaching them about God and urging them to obey him.

    * Usually preaching is done by one person to a large group of people.
    * "Preaching" and "teaching" are similar, but not the same. "Preaching" mainly refers to public proclamation of spiritual or moral truth, and urging the audience to respond. "Teaching" emphasizes instruction, that is, imparting knowledge or skill to the learner. 
    * John the Baptist, Jesus, and the apostles often preached to people that they should repent and enter the kingdom of God.
