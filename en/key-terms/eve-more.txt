===== Eve - More Information =====


From Discussion on 01-12\\ 
//The issue that came to my mind was that the animals could not help the man in the way that he needed. This was the preparation for the giving of Eve to Adam. It may be too theological, but if the reader is alerted that there is more to the “helping” that merely assisting in labor and the like, but that there is a need the man had for a companion, one he could love and receive love from, then there could be more attention paid to the account about the animals. Adam's response when he sees Eve is delight that she is his truest helper. It may be best kept out of this place, but I offer it for discussion. (TW)//
