    * “Adam” is the name of the first man. “**[[:en:key-terms:eve|Eve]]**” is the name of the first woman. Every human being is biologically and genetically related to our first parents, Adam and Eve. 
    * God formed Adam directly out of the dirt of the ground and then breathing into him the breath of life.
    * Adam was made in the image of God. God made Adam with many qualities that God has in himself, like personality, the ability to love, the capacity to make choices, to be self-aware, and to be capable of relationships and to communicate, plus many more. 
    * Adam and Eve disobeyed God. They did what God told them not to do. This separated them from God and brought spiritual and physical death into their lives and into the world that God had made.
