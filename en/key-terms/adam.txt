====== Adam ======


===== Definitions: =====

  * The name of the first man, from whom every person descended.
  * God formed Adam from the dirt of the ground and breathed the breath of life into him.
  * Adam's name is the same as the Old Testament word for “man,” and similar to the word for “dirt” from which he was formed.
  * Adam was made in the image of God--he shared some of God's characteristics, but was not equal with God.
  * Adam and his wife, **[[:en:key-terms:eve|Eve]]**, disobeyed God. This caused them to become sinners, and to pass on that sin to all of their descendents.
