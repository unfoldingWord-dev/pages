====== angel ======


===== Definition: =====


An angel is a powerful spirit being whom God created. These spirit beings exist to serve God by doing whatever he tells them to do. They serve God in different ways:

    * They give people messages from God, including commands and other instructions.
    * They protect and strengthen people.
    * They guard people and places.

Sometimes in the Bible "the angel of Yahweh" is used to refer to God Himself.

The opposite of "angel" is a "demon."
