====== miracle ======


==== (miracle, wonder, sign) ====

===== Definitions: =====

  * Miracles are things that could never happen unless God caused them. For example, it was a miracle when God brought a dead person back to life.
  * Another word for miracles is “wonders”.
  * When people do a miracle, they ask God, and God is the one who gives them the power to do that miracle. People don't have the power to do miracles on their own.
  * For example, the prophets asked God to heal people, to provide food from nothing and even to raise people from the dead, and God did those things.
  * Often miracles are called “signs” because they show that it is God who is working.
