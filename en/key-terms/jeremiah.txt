===== Facts: =====

  * Jeremiah was one of God's prophets in Judah.
  * Like most of the prophets, Jeremiah often had to warn the people that God was going to punish them for their sins.
  * When Jeremiah prophesied that the Babylonians were going to capture Jerusalem, some of the people of Judah were angry. So they put him in a dry well, planning to leave him there to die.
  * But the king of Judah ordered his servants to pull Jeremiah out of the well so that he could live.
