====== love ======


===== Definition: =====

To "love" something is to want to have, protect, care for, or enjoy something. 

  * When people say they "love" something, they sometimes simply mean they like it very much. For example, someone could say, "I love good food." 
  * The most basic form of "love" for another person is a positive emotional feeling towards that person.
  * To love someone is to have affection for him and to be devoted and committed to him and to what is good for him. 
  * The way that God loves us is much deeper than "to like" or a mere "emotion." Jesus "loved" us by sacrificing everything, including his life, in order to rescue us from sin and death. God's love causes him to act strongly for our good. 
  * Christians demonstrate their love for God when they sacrificially serve and obey God.
  * Christians demonstrate their love for other believers when they care for their needs and share in their burdens.
  * Christians demonstrate their love for those who do not believe in Jesus when they tell them that Jesus provided a way for them to be saved from sin and death.
  * These are ways some languages talk about loving someone: “He put him in his heart” or, “His thoughts were towards him” or, “He feels good-heart toward him.”
