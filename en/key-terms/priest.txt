====== priest ======


===== Definition: =====

A priest is a person with the special job of intermediary, or standing between, God and his people. God chose Aaron and his descendants to be his priests for the people of Israel. They did many different things, including:


  * Priests presented people's offerings to God.
  * Priests would pray to God for the people.
  * Priests taught the people God's instructions.
  * Priests would bless the people.

"Priest" could be translated as "intermediary," "mediator," "middle-man" or "sacrificer." Besides God's priests, there were also other priests who presented offerings to false gods such as Baal.
