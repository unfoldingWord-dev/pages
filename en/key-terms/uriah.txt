====== Uriah ======


===== Facts: =====

  * Uriah was one of King David's best soldiers.
  * David slept with Uriah's wife, Bathsheba, and she became pregnant.
  * David hoped that Uriah would sleep with Bathsheba so that Uriah would think that he was the father of the baby.
  * Uriah refused to sleep with his wife while the other men were still fighting.
  * So David sent Uriah back to the war and Uriah died in battle.
