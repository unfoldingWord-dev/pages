====== LORD ======


==== (Yahweh, LORD, I AM) ====


===== Definitions: =====


    * God's Hebrew name is //Yahweh//, which means "He is."
    * It stresses that He is eternal and self-existent.
    * God told Moses that this is His name.
    * Jews later believed that because God's name is holy, they should not speak it.
    * So they called God //Adonai//, which means "lord".
    * Many English Bibles follow this custom. They write "LORD" when it is a translation of //Yahweh//  and they write "Lord" or "lord" when it is a translation of //Adonai//. (They also write "Lord" or "lord" when it is a translation of the Greek word //kyrios//, which means "lord".)
