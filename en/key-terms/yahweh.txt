==== (Yahweh, LORD, I AM, Jehovah) ====


===== Facts: =====

This is God's name. He told his name to Moses at the burning bush, and said that this was his name forever.
    * God's name means "he is" or "he who is."
    * It stresses that he is eternal and self-existent - he did need anyone to create him or give him life.
    * When God refers to himself, he also says "I am."
    * Much later, the Jews decided that since God's name was holy, they should not say it. So they said “lord” instead.
    * Many English Bibles follow this custom. They write “LORD” with all uppercase letters in place of God's name.
