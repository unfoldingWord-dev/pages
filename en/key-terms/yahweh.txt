====== Yahweh ======


==== (Yahweh, LORD, I AM, Jehovah) ====


===== Facts: =====

This is God's name. He told his name to Moses at the burning bush, and said that this was his name forever.

    * God's Hebrew name is //Yahweh//, which means "He is."
    * It stresses that He is eternal and self-existent.
    * Jews later believed that because God's name is holy, they should not speak it. So they called God //Adonai//, which means "lord".
    * Many English Bibles follow this custom. They write "LORD" when it is a translation of //Yahweh//  and they write "Lord" or "lord" when it is a translation of //Adonai//. (They also write "Lord" or "lord" when it is a translation of the Greek word //kyrios//, which means "lord".)
