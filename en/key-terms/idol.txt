====== idol ======




===== Definitions: =====

An idol is an object that people make so they can worship it.

  * People make idols to represent the gods that they worship.
  * These false gods do not exist--there is no God besides Yahweh. Therefore the idols have no power.
  * People believe in idols for many reasons. Sometimes things they ask the idols for coincidentally happen. Sometimes demons cause the idols to appear to have power in order to deceive people into worshipping them.
  * Idols are often made of precious materials like gold or silver.
