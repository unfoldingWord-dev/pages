====== blood ======


==== (term, other) ====


===== Definitions: =====

  * Blood is the red liquid in our bodies that can flow out when we are injured.
  * In the Bible, blood is often a symbol of death, because if a person loses too much blood, he will die.
  * However, because a person cannot live without the blood in his body, blood is also a symbol of life.
  * When people made sacrifices to God, they killed an animal and poured its blood on the altar. God allowed them to kill the animal so they would not have to be killed as punishment for their sins. 
  * Jesus died as the perfect sacrifice. His blood symbolically covers our sins and cleanses us from them.
