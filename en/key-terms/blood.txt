====== blood ======


==== (term, other) ====


===== Definitions: =====

Blood is the red liquid in our bodies that can flow out when we are injured.

  * People and animals need the blood in their bodies in order to live. So blood is often a symbol of life.
  * But blood can also be a symbol of death since if too much blood comes out (because of being injured or sick), that person or animal will die.
  * When people made sacrifices to God, they killed an animal and poured its blood on the altar. God told them to kill the animal  in their place so they would not have to be killed as punishment for their sins. 
  * Jesus died as the perfect sacrifice. His blood symbolically covers our sins and cleanses us from them.
