===== Definition: =====


The apostles were men sent by Jesus to preach about God.


    * The word "apostle" means, "someone who is sent out for a special purpose."
    * Jesus chose twelve apostles from among his followers, and gave these apostles special status and responsibilities. The apostles had a closer relationship to Jesus than his other disciples did.

    * Judas was one of the twelve apostles, but he betrayed Jesus, and then killed himself.
    * After Jesus returned to heaven, the remaining eleven apostles became the leaders of the early church. They taught the believers about Jesus, and also wrote many of the New Testament books of the Bible.
    * The word "apostle" can also be translated as, "messenger."
    * The Bible often calls the apostles, "the twelve" or, after Judas died, "the eleven."
