===== Definition: =====


[new]


The word, "church" refers to a collective group of people who believe in Jesus. When those believers are in a local area such as a city or a region, it is written as, "church." When it refers to believers everywhere, it is written as, "Church."


    * The original word for "church" referred to the citizens of a city that had the right to assemble to vote on important issues.
    * Jesus and the apostles used the word "church" to refer to Christians who have the right to assemble together in the name of Jesus.
    * "Church" could be translated as a "gathering together" or "assembly" of believers. The word "congregation" has a similar meaning. However, the believers are still the "church" even when they are not together.
    * In the Bible, the word "church" always refers to believers, and never to a building.
    * The church meets together to pray, teach God's truth, and encourage each other to live in a way that is pleasing to God.
