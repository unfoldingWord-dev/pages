====== God ======


===== Facts: =====

God is the eternal one. He alone existed before anything else, and He will continue to exist forever. He created the heavens and earth and all living beings in the heavens and on earth. He is infinitely wise, infinitely powerful (almighty), and sovereign. The one true God exists as three persons: the Father, the Holy Spirit, and the Son.

    * God sustains the universe, and He provides for His creatures.
    * God is perfectly righteous, sinless, just, merciful, loving.
    * God wants people to worship Him alone and not anyone else.
    * God punishes sin, yet in His mercy He provides salvation.
    * God is a covenant-keeping God, who always fulfills His promises.
    * God reveals Himself through His creation and through the Bible.
