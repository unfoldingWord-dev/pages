===== "good" =====


In agreement with God's character and purposes.


  * The Hebrew word for good (טוֹב///ṭôv//) carries the general meaning “pleasing” or “excellent”, concepts that finds their truest and most full meaning in the character and nature of God.

  * In the original language, “good” (טוֹב///ṭôv//) can, in some instances, have a very concrete meaning or, in other cases, cary a rather abstract conceptual meaning. Concretely, “good” can refer to either an esthetic or visual quality, denoting beauty; yet abstractly, this term can denote an intrinsic quality inherent in the object which is good. In this manner the general meaning of טוֹב///ṭôv//- “pleasing” or “excellent”- can relate varying emphases depending on the immediate context of the usage. 
    * For example, some uses of טוֹב///ṭôv//,as seen in frames 01-11, 01-12, denote a more abstract qualitative understanding of “good,” while we the nature of frames such as 01-02, 01-05 speak not only to creation’s innate quality but its visual beauty as creation was, in its fullness, pleasing to God.
