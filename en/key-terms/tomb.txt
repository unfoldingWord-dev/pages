====== tomb ======


==== (tomb, grave) ====


===== Definition: =====

A tomb is a place where people put the bodies of those who die. 

  * The Jews sometimes used natural caves as tombs, and sometimes they dug caves out of the rock on the side of a hill. 
  * When Jesus was living, it was common to roll a large, heavy, round stone in front of the opening of a tomb in order to close it.
  * This can also be translated as, "grave." But if your word for grave can only refer to a hole dug down into the ground so that the body is placed below the ground, then it might be better to translate it as, "cave" or, "hole in a hill."
