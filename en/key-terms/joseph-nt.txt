  ***[[:en:obs-training:frames:22-04|[22-04]]]** When Elizabeth was six months pregnant, the same angel appeared to Elizabeth’s relative, whose name was Mary. She was a virgin and was engaged to a man named **Joseph**.
  ***[[:en:obs-training:frames:23-01|[23-01]]]** **Joseph** was a righteous man. When he heard that Mary was pregnant, he knew it was not his baby. He did not want to shame her, so he planned to quietly divorce her.
  ***[[:en:obs-training:frames:23-02|[23-02]]]** The angel said, “**Joseph**, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife. What is in her is from the Holy Spirit. She will give birth to a son. Name him Jesus, because he will save the people from their sins.”
  ***[[:en:obs-training:frames:23-03|[23-03]]]** So **Joseph** married her and took her home as his wife, but he did not sleep with her until she had given birth.
  ***[[:en:obs-training:frames:23-04|[23-04]]]** **Joseph** and Mary had to make a long journey from where they lived in Nazareth to Bethlehem because their ancestor was David whose hometown was Bethlehem.
