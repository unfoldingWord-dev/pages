====== Dividing Chapters for Translation Notes ======

(This page is in progress. Please add your comments and suggestions to the Discussion area below.)


===== Division Principles: =====

  * Keep sections short so that excessive scrolling will not be necessary in order to view all the notes. Ideal length would be 2-4 verses, depending on the length of the verses.
  * Use natural divisions as much as possible--clear paragraph divisions, sharp subject or location changes, etc.
  * Consider the theological and grammatical complexity of the verses when dividing. More complex passages should be shorter, if possible.
  * Give extra weight to the structure of the original-language text rather than to English-langauge divisions.
