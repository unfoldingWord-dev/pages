===== Purpose of the Translation Notes: =====

  * The Notes are intended to explain how to **translate** the text. They are not for Bible study, doctrinal teaching, preaching, etc. 
  * The Notes should be helpful for people whose first language is not English. 
  * The Notes should useful even without any significant biblical or theological background.
  * The Notes should provide incremental help by presenting basic content first, and then linking to more in-depth resources as needed.
  * The Notes should be easy to translate into a variety of "gateway" languages.


===== Notes (in progress): =====

  - Make the notes brief and to the point.
  - Focus on issues of "translation" rather than "interpretation."
  - Avoid high-level terminology (biblical, theological, grammatical, etc.)
  - Use simple grammar and vocabulary as much as possible to aid in understanding and also to enable easier translation into other gateway languages.
  - Avoid English-language idioms and terms or phrases that would be difficult to translate.
  - Avoid using original-langauge terms in the notes. If necessary,use a transliteration. If possible, put any more complex explanation in a footnote or on a Key Terms page.
