====== Luke 1:78-79 ======


===== TFT Text: =====

<sup>78</sup> Our God will do that because he is very kind to us.\\
Just like a new day begins when the sun rises [MET],\\
God will do that new thing for us when the Messiah comes to us from heaven.\\
<sup>79</sup> People who do not know God [MET] are like those who sit in the darkness.\\
They are afraid [MTY] that they will soon die.\\
But when the Messiah tells us God's message,\\
it will be like causing such people to see a bright light.\\
He will guide us [SYN] so that we will be living peacefully.\\


===== UFW Text: =====

<sup>78</sup> because of the tender mercy of our God,\\
whereby the dawn from on high will visit us,\\
<sup>79</sup> to shine on those who sit in darkness and the shadow of death;\\
to guide our feet into the way of peace.”\\

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **because**- For some languages it may be more clear to start a new sentence here and say something like, "These things will happen because…"
    * **because of the tender mercy of our God**  - Another way to translate this phrase would be, "because God is compassionate and merciful to us."
    * **of our God **- This could also be translated as, "that God has shown us." Note that throughout these verses "our" and "us" are inclusive.
    * **by which**- That is, "by means of which" or "through which" or "because of which." It means that it is God's mercy that has caused him to provide a way of salvation for sinful people.
    * **the rising (sun) - **  This is sometimes translated as "the sunrise" or "the dawn" and refers to Jesus, the one who will bring the salvation referred to previously in these verses.
    * **on high**  - That is, "from heaven." The whole phrase could mean either "the rising (sun) from heaven will visit us" or "the rising (sun) will visit us from heaven." The meanings are similar.
    * **our feet**  - This is a syndecdoche and refers to the whole person, not just the feet. It is used as part of the word picture of God guiding us to walk along a path of peace. It could also be translated as "us."
    * **into the way of peace **- That is, "to walk along a path that leads to peace" or "to live in a way that brings peace with God." Make sure your translation of this fits with how you translate "our feet."
