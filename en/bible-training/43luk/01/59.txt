====== Luke 1:59-61 ======


===== TFT Text: =====

<sup>59</sup> Seven days later they gathered together for the //ceremony for// circumcising the baby //to show that he belonged to God//. Since his father's name was Zechariah, they wanted to give the baby the same name. <sup>60</sup> But his mother said, “No, //his name will not be Zechariah.// His name will be John!” <sup>61</sup> So they said to her, “//John// is not the name of any of your (dl) relatives, //so you// (dl) //should not give him that name//!” 


===== UFW Text: =====

<sup>59</sup> On the eighth day, they came to circumcise the child; and they would have called him Zacharias, after the name of his father. <sup>60</sup> His mother answered, “Not so; but he will be called John.” <sup>61</sup> They said to her, “There is no one among your relatives who is called by this name.”

  * **they would have called him** - That is, "they were going to name him" or "they wanted to give  him the name"
  * **by this name** - Since Elizabeth had said the name and they were talking to her, some translators might prefer to write "by that name."
