<sup>26</sup> Now in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee, named Nazareth, <sup>27</sup> to a virgin pledged to be married to a man whose name was Joseph, of David’s house. The virgin’s name was Mary. <sup>28</sup> Having come in, the angel said to her, “Rejoice, you highly favored one! The Lord is with you. Blessed are you among women!” <sup>29</sup> But when she saw him, she was greatly troubled at the saying, and considered what kind of salutation this might be.
