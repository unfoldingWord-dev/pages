====== Luke 1:16-17 ======


===== TFT Text: =====

<sup>16</sup> He will //persuade// many people in Israel to turn away //from their sins and please// the Lord their God. <sup>17</sup> As //God's// Spirit enables him //to preach// powerfully as //the prophet// Elijah did, he will precede //the Messiah//. He will cause parents [SYN] to act //peacefully// toward their children //again//. He will cause //many// people who do not obey //God to hear and obey// the wise things that righteous people //tell them//. He will do this in order to make //many// people to be ready when the Lord //comes//.”


===== UFW Text: =====

<sup>16</sup> He will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord, their God. <sup>17</sup> He will go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, ‘to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children,’ and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to prepare a people prepared for the Lord.”

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **He will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord, their God** - That is, "John will cause many of the people of Israel to turn to the Lord their God," or "he will cause many of the people of Israel to go back to the Lord their God." Since Zacharias worshiped the Lord, this could also be translated as "... the Lord your God" with "your" referring to Zacharias and the other people of Israel. 
  * **He will go before him** - That is, "John will go to them before the Lord their God goes to them." John would go to the people and let them know that the Lord would go to them. 
  * **in the spirit and power of Elijah** - That is, "with the same attitude and power that Elijah had."
  * **to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children** - "to cause parents to act peacefully toward their children again."
  * **the disobedient to the wisdom of the just** - That is "to persuade those who were disobedient to live wisely as righteous people live."
  * **to prepare a people prepared for the Lord** - John would do all that so that some of the people would be ready when the Lord came.
