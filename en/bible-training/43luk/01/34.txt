===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **how can this be** - That is, "how is this possible" or, "how can this happen?"
  * **come on you** - This can also be translated as "happen to you" or, "overtake you." We do not know how God did this, but we know that it was not a sexual union, because God is spirit. 
  * **overshadow you** - This can also be translated as "cast his shadow over you" or "cover you with his shadow." This expresses how God will supernaturally cause Mary to become pregnant without a sexual union.
  * **the holy one who is born from you** - This can also be translated as "the one who will be born holy from you" or "the holy child that will come from you."
