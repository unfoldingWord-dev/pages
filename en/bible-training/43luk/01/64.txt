===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **his mouth was opened ... his tongue freed** - These are idioms meaning that now he was able to speak. He could now communicate by using his mouth.
  * **he spoke, blessing God** - Now that he could speak he actually did speak, and what he said was in praise of God.
  * **Fear came on all who lived  around them** - That is "All who lived around were afraid" because they saw that God is powerful. "All who lived around them" does not refer just to their immediate neighbors, but all who lived in that area.
  * **all these sayings were talked about ** - That is, "people talked about all these things that had happened"
  * **laid them up in their heart** - That is, "kept thinking about them" or "wondered about them". "Them" refers to the things that happened.
  * **saying** - This could also be translated as "wondering" or "thinking". 
  * **What then will this child be?** - This is a rhetorical question that shows the people's surprise. Because of what they had heard about the baby, they realized that he would grow up to be an important man. This could also be translated as "What kind of great person will this child grow up to be?" or "What a great man this child will be!"
  * **the hand of the Lord was with him** - That is, "The Lord's power was with him" or "The Lord was working in him powerfully." This is an example of synecdoche in which the phrase "the hand of the Lord" refers to the Lord's power.
