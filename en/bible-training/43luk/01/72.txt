===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **fathers**  - That is, "ancestors." This refers to the ancestors of the Jews who lived a long time ago. Also see "father" in the next verse and translate it the same way.
    * **remember **- In this context, "remember" does not mean to not forget. It means to keep a commitment or fulfill something.
    * **oath which he swore**  - That is, "solemn promise that he made." This does not refer to saying a swear word or any other wrong speech. This is about making a vow or a pledge to do something. //[This second sentence could be deleted.]//
    * **being delivered **- That is, "after we have been delivered" or "after God has rescued us."
    * **out of the hand of**** our enemies**  - That is, "from the control of our enemies" or "from being harmed and enslaved by our enemies." As in verse 71, "hand" refers to the harmful control or power a person has over another person.
    * **to grant to usâ€¦.without fear**- Another way to translate this would be, "to make it possible that after we have been rescued from the control of our enemies, we will be able to serve him and not be afraid."
    * **in holiness and righteousness**- That is, "while we live in a holy and righteous way."
    * **before him**- This means, "in his presence" or "according to his will." //[or "that pleases him."]//
