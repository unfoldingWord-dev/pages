====== Luke 1:1-4 ======


===== TFT Text: =====

<sup>1-2</sup> My noble //friend// Theophilus, many people saw the things that //Jesus// did while he was with us, from the time when he started [MTY] //his ministry//. They served God //by teaching people// the message //about the Lord Jesus//. Many of those who heard what they taught wrote down for us accounts of the things that //Jesus did from the time when// he began //his ministry//. <sup>3</sup> I myself have studied carefully these accounts. So I decided that it would be good for me also to write for you (sg) an accurate account of these matters. <sup>4</sup> I want you to know the truth about what you have been taught {what others have taught you}.


===== UFW Text: =====

<sup>1</sup> Many people have (undertaken/attempted/tried) to write an orderly account about those matters (which have been fulfilled) among us. <sup>2</sup> These events were reported to us by those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and became servants of the word. <sup>3</sup> So, since I also have accurately researched everything that happened from the beginning, I thought it would be good for me to write it down for you in an orderly way, most excellent Theophilus, <sup>4</sup> so that you might know that the things which you were taught are true.
