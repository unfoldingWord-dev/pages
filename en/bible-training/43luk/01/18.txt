<sup>18</sup> Then Zechariah said to the angel, “I am very old, and my wife is also so old //that she cannot bear a child//. So ◄I //cannot //believe// that what you (sg) said //will happen//!/how can I //believe// that what you (sg) said will// happen?► [RHQ]” <sup>19</sup> Then the angel said to him, “I am //God's chief angel,// Gabriel! //I do what God tells me, because// I constantly stand in God's presence! I was sent {He sent me} to tell you (sg) this good message //about what will happen to you//. <sup>20</sup> What I have told you will certainly happen at the time //God decides//, but you did not believe my words. So now //God will cause// that you will be unable to talk until the day //your son is born//!”

<sup>18</sup> Zacharias said to the angel, “How can I be sure of this? For I am an old man, and my wife is well advanced in years.” <sup>19</sup> The angel answered him, “I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God. I was sent to speak to you, and to bring you this good news. <sup>20</sup> Behold, you will be silent and not able to speak, until the day that these things will happen, because you didn’t believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their proper time.”
