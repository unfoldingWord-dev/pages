===== TFT Text: =====

<sup>21</sup> While //Zechariah and the angel// were talking, the people //in the courtyard// were waiting for Zechariah //to come out//. They wondered, “Why is he staying in the Temple for such a long time?” <sup>22</sup> When he came out, he was not able to speak to them. Because he could not talk, he made motions with his hands //to try to convey what had happened//. Then they realized that he had seen ◄a vision //from God///something that //God// showed him► while he was in the Temple. <sup>23</sup> When Zechariah's time to work //as a priest in the Temple// was finished, he //left Jerusalem and// returned to his home.
