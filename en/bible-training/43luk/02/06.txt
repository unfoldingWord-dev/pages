When they arrived //in Bethlehem//, there was no place for them to stay in the house where travelers stay. //So they stayed in a cattle shed.// When the time for Mary to give birth arrived, she gave birth to her first son there. She wrapped him in strips of cloth and placed him in a trough where //people// put food for the animals.
