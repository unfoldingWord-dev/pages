His parents marveled about what //Simeon// said about //Jesus//. Then Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary, “Note what I say: //God// has determined that because of this child, many Israelite people will //turn away from God//, and many others will turn to God [MET]. Although he will be like a sign [MET] //to warn people, many// people will oppose him. As a result, the //evil// thoughts of many people will be made evident {he will reveal the //evil// thoughts of many people}. //Furthermore, the cruel things that they will do to him// [MET] //will be like// a sword that will pierce your ◄soul/inner being►.”
