<sup>29-32</sup> Lord, you promised me that I would see the one [MTY] who would enable you to save people of all people-groups from the guilt of their sins. He will be [MET] like a light that will reveal your truth to non-Jews, and he will cause people to think highly of your people, the Israelite people. Since I [SYN] have now seen this one that you promised to send, now let me die peacefully.
