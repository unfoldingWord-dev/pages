====== Luke 2:22-24 ======


===== TFT Text: =====

It had been written by Moses {Moses had written} //long ago// in a law that God gave him, that when a woman gave birth to her first son, the parents had to take him //to the Temple// in Jerusalem in order that they might dedicate him ◄to the Lord/to God►. So when the time came for them to do those rituals so that //God would consider// them pure again, Mary and Joseph took Jesus there. God had commanded in his laws that if the first child //of a couple// was a boy, his parents should offer as a sacrifice to God two turtledoves or two young pigeons. //So Joseph and Mary gave the priest two birds so he could offer them.//
