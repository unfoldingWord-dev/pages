====== Luke 2:17-20 ======


===== TFT Text: =====

Then they told //Mary and Joseph and others// what had been told them {what //the angel// had told them} about this child. Everyone who heard what was said by the shepherds {what the shepherds said} to them was amazed. But Mary //did not talk to others about what the angels said//; she just kept thinking very much about it. The shepherds returned //to their sheep//. They kept praising God very much for all the things that they had heard and seen, //because// everything //happened// exactly like //the angels// told them.
