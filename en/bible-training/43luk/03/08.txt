====== Luke 3:8 ======


===== TFT Text: =====

<sup>8</sup> Do the deeds that are appropriate for people who have truly turned from their sinful behavior! //God promised to give Abraham many// descendants. In order to fulfill that promise, God does not need you! I tell you that he can change these stones to make them descendants of Abraham! So do not begin to say to yourselves, ‘We (exc) are descendants of Abraham, //so God will not punish us, even though we have// sinned!’ 


===== UFW Text: =====

<sup>8</sup> Therefore produce fruits worthy of repentance, and don’t begin to say among yourselves, ‘We have Abraham for our father;’ for I tell you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones!
