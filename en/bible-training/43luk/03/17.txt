====== Luke 3:17 ======


===== TFT Text: =====

He //is like a man// [MET] //who wants to// clear away the grain on the ground where it has been threshed {they have threshed it}. That man //uses// a huge fork //to throw the grain into the air// to separate the wheat from the chaff [MET], and then he cleans up the threshing area. //Similarly//, God will //separate righteous people from the evil people, like a man who// gathers the wheat into his storage area, and then he will burn //those who are like// chaff with a fire ◄that will never be put out/that will burn forever►.”
