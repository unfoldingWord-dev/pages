====== Luke 4:9-11 ======

Then the devil took //Jesus// to Jerusalem. He set him on the highest part of the Temple and said to him, “Because you //claim that you// ◄//have a relationship with God as a son has with his father// [MET]/are the man who is both God and man►, //prove it// by jumping down from here. //You will not be hurt//, because it is written {the //Psalmist// wrote} //in the Scriptures//, ‘God will command his angels to protect you (sg). They will lift you up in their hands //when you are falling//, so that //you will not get hurt//. You will not //even// strike your foot on a stone.’”

<sup>9</sup> He led him to Jerusalem, and set him on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, cast yourself down from here, <sup>10</sup> for it is written, 
‘He will put his angels in charge of you, to guard you;’ 
<sup>11</sup> and, 
‘On their hands they will bear you up, 
lest perhaps you dash your foot against a stone.’”
