**Get Involved!**


Our dream is to make this visual mini-Bible available in //every language of the world//! This is not impossibleâ€”we think it can happen if the whole body of Christ works together and uses modern technology like the Internet & mobile phones to translate & distribute this resource. Here's how you can help:

**JOIN THE TEAM!**

Meet the rest of the Door43 world missions community who helped create Open Bible Stories, and get connected at **facebook.com/door43**.

**SHARE FREELY!**

Give as many copies of this book away as you want, no strings attached. All digital versions are free online, and because of the open license we are using, you can even republish Open Bible Stories commercially anywhere in the world //without paying royalties//!

EXTEND!
Get Open Bible Stories as videos and mobile phone applications in other languages at **openbiblestories.com**. On the website, you can also get help translating Open Bible Stories into //your// language.
