====== heal ======


===== Definition: =====


To heal is to cause a person's wounds, disease, or disability (such as blindness) to no longer exist. It also means to cause a sick or disabled person to be healthy again.

    * A person who is healed has been made well.
    * Natural healing happens gradually. 
    * Miraculous healing normally occur suddenly, as when Peter caused a crippled man to immediately be able to walk.
