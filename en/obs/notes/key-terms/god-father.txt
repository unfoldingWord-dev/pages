====== God the Father ======


==== (God the Father, the Father, heavenly Father) ====


===== Facts: =====

God the Father, together with the Son and the Holy Spirit, is Yahweh, the one true God. 

  * God exists as the Father, the Holy Spirit, and the Son. Each one is fully God, and yet they are only one God. This is a mystery that mere humans cannot fully understand.
  * The title, "God the Father," expresses the kind of personal relationship that he has to "God the Son." It is not a physical relationship. Rather, it expresses that the Son honors and serves the Father.
  * God the Father sends the Holy Spirit to his people.
  * Anyone who believes in the Son becomes a child of God the Father.
