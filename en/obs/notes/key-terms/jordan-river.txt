The Jordan River is a river that flows from north to south, and forms the eastern boundary of the land that was called Canaan.

  * The Jordan River flows through the Sea of Galilee and then empties into the Dead Sea.
  * When Joshua led the Israelites into Canaan, they had to cross the Jordan River while it was flooding and very deep. Because it was too deep to wade across, God miraculously stopped the water from flowing so they could go across.
