====== love ======


===== Definition: =====

To love someone is to want to protect, care for, and be with that person. 

  * To love someone is to have affection for him and to be devoted and committed to him and to what is good for him. 
  * Love is much deeper than "to like" or a mere emotion. Jesus loved us by sacrificing everything, including his life, in order to rescue us from sin and death.
  * Jesus said that the greatest love is to sacrifice yourself for someone else.
  * These are ways some languages talk about loving someone: "He put him in his heart" or, "His thoughts were towards him" or, "He feels good-heart toward him." 
  * While love is usually a strong commitment to a person, it can also be commitment to an ideal such as truth or justice.
  * In other cases when people say they love something, they simply mean they like it very much. For example, someone could say, "I love good food."
