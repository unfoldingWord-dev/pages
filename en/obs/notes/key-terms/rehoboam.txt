===== Facts: =====

Rehoboam was one of the sons of King Solomon, and became the king of the nation of Israel after Solomon died.

  * Rehoboam continued to be the king of the kingdom of Judah, which consisted of the two tribes who remained loyal to him.
  * Rehoboam was a wicked king who did not obey Yahweh, but served false gods.
