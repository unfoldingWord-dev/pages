====== Adam ======


===== Facts: =====

Adam was made in the image of God. God made Adam with many qualities that God has in himself, like personality, the ability to love, the capacity to make choices, to be self-aware, and to be capable of relationships and to communicate, plus many more.

    * Adam was the first man.
    * God formed him from dirt and breathed life into him.
    * Adam's name sounds similar to the Hebrew word for "red dirt" or "ground."
    * The name "Adam" is the same as the Old Testament word for "mankind" or "human being."
    * All people are descendants of Adam and Eve.

Adam and Eve disobeyed God. They did what God told them not to do. This separated them from God and brought spiritual and physical death into their lives and into the world that God had made.
