====== holy ======


===== Definition: =====

To be holy is to be separated from all sin and evil. Only God is absolutely holy. But he can make things and people holy.

  * A holy person or thing is morally perfect, completely without sin. 
  * People and things that God sets apart for a special purpose are called holy, such as a priest who must be ceremonially cleansed of sin in order to serve God, or a place where God reveals himself, such as, "holy ground" or his temple.

Make sure that the translation of the word "holy" does not mean something that is taboo or forbidden.
