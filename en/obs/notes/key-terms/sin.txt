====== sin ======


==== (sin, sinful, sinner) ====


===== Definition: =====

Sin is anything that we do or say that is against what God wants.

    * When we disobey God's commands and desires we are sinning.
    * We can sin by active disobedience (rebellion), or by inaction (failing to do something that God wants us to do.)

Adam and Eve sinned by eating the fruit that God told them not to eat. Before that there was no sin in the world. 
Sin is passed from parent to child through the entire human race. 
God must punish sin.
