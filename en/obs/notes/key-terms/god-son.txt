===== Facts: =====

The Son of God is Jesus, who was sent by God to save and rule the world.

  * The Son of God has the same nature as God the Father, and is therefore fully God.
  * Unlike human sons, there was not a time when the Son of God did not exist. (That is, he has always existed.)
  * The Son of God was active, along with the Father and the Holy Spirit, in creating the world.
  * Because Jesus is God's Son, he loves and obeys his Father, and his Father loves him.
