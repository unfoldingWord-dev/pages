A god is something that people worship because they believe it has great power to affect their lives.

  * When God is written with a capital 'G,' it refers to the one and only true God.
  * These "gods" do not exist. Yahweh is the only God, and he has no rival.
  * People sometimes make idols as symbols of their false gods.
