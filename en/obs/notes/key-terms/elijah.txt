====== Elijah ======


===== Facts: =====


Elijah was one of the most important prophets of Yahweh. Elijah prophesied when Ahab was the king of the northern kingdom of Israel.

    * Elijah confronted Ahab because Ahab encouraged the people to worship false gods.
    * God provided food and shelter for Elijah in miraculous ways.
    * God did many miracles through Elijah and showed Israel that Yahweh is the only true God.
    * Elijah confronted the 450 prophets of Baal and demonstrated that Baal is a false god. As a result, the people in the kingdom of Israel killed the prophets of Baal and temporarily worshiped only Yahweh.
    * Elijah did not die--he was taken up to heaven alive. Elijah and Moses then appeared and talked with Jesus hundreds of years later when Jesus was getting ready to die in Jerusalem.
