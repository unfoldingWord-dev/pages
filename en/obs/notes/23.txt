====== 23. The Birth of Jesus ======


===== Overview: =====


Mary became pregnant and would give birth to the Messiah, just as the angel had said. The angel also told Joseph that the baby was conceived by the Holy Spirit and would be named Jesus. So Joseph kept Mary a virgin until Jesus was born in Bethlehem. Angels announced his birth to shepherds, who came to worship him. Wise men from the east also came to worship him and bring him gifts.
