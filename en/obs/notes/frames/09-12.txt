{{:en:obs:obs-09-12.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

One day while **[[:en:key-terms:moses|Moses]]** was **taking care of his sheep**, he saw a bush that was on fire. But the **bush did not burn up**. Moses **went to take a closer look**. As he approached the burning bush, **the voice of [[:en:key-terms:god|God]] said**, “Moses, **take off your shoes**. You are standing on **[[:en:key-terms:holy|holy]] ground**.”


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **taking care of his sheep** - This means he was doing the work of a shepherd to guide the sheep to grass and water, and to protect them. It could be translated as “tending the sheep.” 
  * **bush did not burn up** - God made the bush full of fire, but the fire did not damage the bush.
  * **went to take a closer look** – Other ways to say this would be, “went toward the bush to look at it more closely” or “got closer to the bush to be able to see it better.” 
  * **the voice of God said** - Moses heard God speak, but he did not see God. This could be translated as “God said out loud.” 
  * **take off your shoes** - God wanted him to take off his shoes to show that he greatly respected God. To make clear the reason for this, you could say,”take off your shoes, because you are on holy ground.” 
  * **holy ground** - It was holy in the sense that God set it apart from the ordinary land and made it to be a special place where He would reveal Himself.
