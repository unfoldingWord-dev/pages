**When [[:en:key-terms:joshua|Joshua]] was an old man**, he called all the people of **[[:en:key-terms:israel|Israel]]** together. Then Joshua **renewed the [[:en:key-terms:covenant|covenant]]** that **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** had made with the **[[:en:key-terms:israel|Israelites]]** at **[[:en:key-terms:sinai|Sinai]]**. The people **[[:en:key-terms:promise|promised]]** to **remain [[:en:key-terms:faith|faithful]] to God** and **follow [[:en:key-terms:gods-law|his laws]]**.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **When Joshua was an old man** – It may be more clear to say, “Many years later, when Joshua was an old man…” Joshua was over 100 years old at this time.
  * **renewed the covenant** - This could be translated as, "reminded the people of their obligation to obey the covenant."  
  * **remain faithful to God** - In other words, they would be loyal to God. They would worship and serve only God; they would not worship or serve any other gods. 
  * **follow his laws** - This means that the people would obey the laws that God had given them already as part of the covenant.
