===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **they** – For some languages it may be necessary to explain who this refers to here and say, “the wise men.”
  * **bowed down** -  That is, “bowed low to the ground.” At that time, this was the customary way of showing great respect or reverence.
  * **expensive** – That is, “very valuable.”
  * **A Bible story from:** - If all or portions of the Bible have already been translated into your language, check to make sure that these references point to the correct chapters and verses.
