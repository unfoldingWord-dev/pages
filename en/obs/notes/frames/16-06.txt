But Gideon was **afraid of the people**, so he **waited until nighttime**. Then he tore down the altar and smashed it to pieces. He built a new altar to God near where the altar to the idol used to be and made a **[[:en:key-terms:sacrifice|sacrifice]]** to God on it.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **to tear down** - This means, “to violently bring down" or "to take down and destroy.”
  * **afraid of the people** - That is, Gideon was afraid that his fellow Israelites who worshiped the same idol would be angry with him.
  * **waited until nighttime** - Another way to say this would be, “waited until after dark.” Gideon smashed the altar at night when everyone was asleep so that no one would see him do it.
