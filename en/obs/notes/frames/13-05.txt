{{:en:obs:obs-13-05.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

**Do not make [[:en:key-terms:idol|idols]] or [[:en:key-terms:worship|worship]] them**, **for I, [[:en:key-terms:yahweh|Yahweh]], am a jealous [[:en:key-terms:god|God]]**. **Do not use my name in a disrespectful way**. **Remember to keep the [[:en:key-terms:sabbath|Sabbath]] day [[:en:key-terms:holy|holy]]**. **Do all your work** in six days, for the **[[:en:key-terms:sabbath|seventh day]]** is a **day of rest to remember me**.”


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **Do not make idols or worship them** - This means, “Do not make idols and do not worship them.”
  * **for** – This could be translated as, “because” or “since.”
  * **I…am a jealous God** - This could be translated as, “I…will be angry if you worship or honor anything besides Me.” God strongly desires that his people love, serve, and obey Him more than anything or anyone else. He must be the only master of their lives. 
  * **Do not use my name in a disrespectful way** - This could be translated as, “Do not talk about me in a way that does not show respect and honor” or "Talk about me in a way that gives me proper respect and honor."
  * **Remember to keep** - This could be translated as, “Be sure to keep.” The word “remember” here doesn't just mean to not forget; it also means to do this regularly, that is, regularly observe the Sabbath Day.
  * **Do all your work** - This sentence explains how to keep the Sabbath day holy. To make that clear you could say, “That is, do all your work...” 
  * **seventh day** - To translate this, it is best to use the number (“seventh”) rather than give the name of a specific day of the week. 
  * **day of rest** - This could be translated as, “a day for you to rest” or “the day when you must rest.”
  * **to remember me** - This could be translated as, “to keep me in mind” or “to honor me.”
