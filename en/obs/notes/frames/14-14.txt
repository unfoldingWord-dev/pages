After the **Israelites** had wandered in the wilderness for forty years, all of them **who had rebelled against God** were dead. Then God led **the people** to the edge of the **Promised Land** again. **Moses** was now very old, so God chose **Joshua** to help him lead the people. God also **promised** Moses that **one day**, he would send **another prophet like Moses**.
