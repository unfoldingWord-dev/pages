//A Bible story from: Genesis 24:1-25:26//


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Rebekah's babies were born** - Some languages have a more indirect way of saying this such as, “when Rebekah saw and took them" or, "when Rebekah brought them to light.” 
  * **the older son … the younger son** - This could be translated as, “the first son to come out … the second son to come out.” Make sure that the way “older” and “younger” are translated still communicates that the boys were twins.
  * **red** - This may mean that his skin was very red or that the hair on his body was red.
  * **hairy** - Esau had a lot of hair on his body. You could say, “the older son's body was red, with lots of hair.”
  * **A Bible story from:** - If all or portions of the Bible have already been translated into your language, check to make sure that these references point to the correct chapters and verses.
