Then **[[:en:key-terms:jesus|Jesus]]** asked the **law expert**, “What do you think? Which one of **the three men** **was a neighbor** to the man who was robbed and beaten?” He replied, “The one who was **[[:en:key-terms:mercy|merciful]]** to him.” Jesus told him, “**You go and do the same**.”

//A Bible story from: Luke 10:25-37//


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **law expert** - That is, "an expert in the Jewish law." See how you translated this term in **[[:en:obs:notes:frames:27-01|[27-01]]]**.
  * **the three men** - The three men were the priest, the Levite, and the Samaritan.
  * **neighbor** - Jesus is using the word "neighbor" in a broader sense than in **[[:en:obs:notes:frames:27-02|[27-02]]]**. "Neighbor" here refers to anyone that we meet who needs our help.
  * **was a neighbor** - This can also be translated as, “behaved as a neighbor” or, “was a friend” or, “acted in a loving way”.  
  * **You go and do** – That is, “You, too, should go and do” or, “Now you must do.” Jesus was commanding the law expert to do as the Samaritan did. 
  * **do the same** – That is, “love others, even your enemies.” Make sure it does not sound like “the same” is only referring to helping a wounded man.
  * //A Bible story from// - If all or portions of the Bible have already been translated into your language, check to make sure that these references point to the correct chapters and verses.
