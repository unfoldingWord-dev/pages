{{:en:obs:obs-19-05.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

After three and a half years, **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** told **[[:en:key-terms:elijah|Elijah]]** to return to the **[[:en:key-terms:kingdom-of-israel|kingdom of Israel]]** and **speak with [[:en:key-terms:ahab|Ahab]] because he was going to send** rain again. When Ahab saw Elijah he said, “There you are, **you troublemaker**!” **Elijah said**, “You are the troublemaker! **You have abandoned [[:en:key-terms:yahweh|Yahweh]]**, the true God, and **[[:en:key-terms:worship|worshiped]]** **[[:en:key-terms:baal|Baal]]**. **Bring all the people of the kingdom of Israel to [[:en:key-terms:mount-carmel|Mount Carmel]]**.”


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **speak with Ahab because he was going to send** – This could be translated as, "tell Ahab that God was going to send.” 
  * **you troublemaker** - This means, "You are a troublemaker!" Ahab was accusing Elijah of causing trouble by telling the king that he was doing wrong and also by stopping the rain. 
  * **Elijah said** – Some languages may need to say, “said to him” or, “replied to him.” 
  * **You have abandoned Yahweh** - That is, Ahab had led Israel to stop worshiping and obeying Yahweh.
