{{:en:obs:obs-32-09.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

When the people who took care of the pigs saw **what happened**, they ran into the town and told everyone that they met what **[[:en:key-terms:jesus|Jesus]]** had done. The people from the town came and saw the man **who used to have the [[:en:key-terms:demon|demons]]**. He was sitting calmly, wearing clothes, and acting like a normal person.


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **what happened** - That is, “how Jesus sent the demons out of the man and into the pigs.”
  * **who used to have the demons** – That is, “in whom the demons had lived” or, “who had been controlled by the evil spirits.”
