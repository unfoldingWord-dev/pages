====== Shouting to God [15-04] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-15-04.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

Then on the seventh day, the **[[:en:key-terms:israel|Israelites ]]**marched around the city **seven times**. **On the last time around the city**, the soldiers shouted while the **[[:en:key-terms:priest|priests]] blew their trumpets**.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **seven times** – It may be more clear to say, “seven more times” since this was in addition to the times they had marched around the city each of the six days before this. 
  * **On the last time around the city** - This can be translated as, “While they marched around the city for the last time” or “During their final circuit around the city.” 
  * **blew their trumpets** - This could be translated as, “They sounded their trumpets” or “They played their trumpets.” These trumpets were made out of ram's horns.
