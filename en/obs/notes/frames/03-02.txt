So even though Noah was not sinless, God was gracious to him and made a plan to rescue his family from the devastating flood. Make sure this doesn't sound like Noah was lucky or that he just happened to escape. Rather, it was God's choice.
  * **the flood** - See how you translated this in **[[:en:obs:notes:frames:03-01|[03-01]]]**.
  * **planning to send** - God planned to cause deep water to cover the earth by sending a lot of rain. That is, he planned to cause the flood by causing a lot of rain to fall.
