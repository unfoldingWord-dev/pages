But **[[:en:key-terms:noah|Noah]] found favor** with **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]**. He was a **[[:en:key-terms:righteous|righteous]]** man, living among wicked people. God told Noah about the flood He was **planning to send**. He told Noah to build a huge boat.

===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **found favor** - God was pleased with Noah because he feared and obeyed God. So even though Noah was not sinless, God was gracious to him and made a plan to rescue his family from the devastating flood. Make sure this doesn't sound like Noah was lucky or that he just happened to escape. Rather, it was God's choice. 
  * **planning to send** - God planned to cause deep water to cover the earth by sending a lot of rain. That is, he planned to cause the flood by causing a lot of rain to fall.
