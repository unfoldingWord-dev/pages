====== The Camel and the Needle [28-06] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-28-06.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

Then **[[:en:key-terms:jesus|Jesus]]** said to his **[[:en:key-terms:disciple|disciples]]**, “**How hard it is** for rich people to **enter into the [[:en:key-terms:kingdom-of-god|kingdom of God]]**! Yes, it is easier for a **[[:en:key-terms:camel|camel]]** to go through the **eye of a needle** than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.”


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **How hard it is** - This expression means, "it is extremely hard."
  * **enter the kingdom of God** - This can also be translated as, “become a citizen in God's kingdom.” 
  * **eye of a needle** - This refers to the tiny hole in the end of a sewing needle. The idea of something as large as a camel going through the eye of a needle is intended to represent something that is impossible.
