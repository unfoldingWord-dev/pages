====== The Gnats and the Flies [10-05] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-10-05.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

So **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]] sent a plague** of **gnats**. Then he sent a plague of **flies**. **[[:en:key-terms:pharaoh|Pharaoh]]** called **[[:en:key-terms:moses|Moses]]** and **[[:en:key-terms:aaron|Aaron]]** and told them **they could leave if they stopped the plague**. Moses prayed, and God removed all the flies from **[[:en:key-terms:egypt|Egypt]]**, but Pharaoh **hardened his heart** and would not let the people go.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **God sent a plague** – This could be translated as, “God caused there to be a plague….” or “God caused a plague...to come over the land of Egypt.”
  * **gnats** - These were tiny, biting insects flying in large swarms, annoying and landing on all the people and animals of Egypt. 
  * **flies** - These were much bigger flying insects that were both annoying and destructive. There were so many of these flies that they covered everything, even filling the Egyptians' houses.
  * **they could leave if they stopped the plague** – It may be more clear to say, “the Israelites could leave Egypt if Moses and Aaron stopped the plague.”
  * **hardened his heart** - He became stubborn again and refused to obey God.
