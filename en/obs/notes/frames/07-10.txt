===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **they were happily reunited** – Another way to say this would be, “they were happy to see each other again."
  * **lived peacefully** - This refers to the fact that Esau and Jacob were not angry with each other and did not fight with each other. 
  * **buried him** - This could mean that they dug a hole in the ground, placed Isaac's body in it, and covered the hole with dirt or stones. Or it could mean that they placed Isaac's body in a cave and covered the opening.
  * **covenant promises** - These were the promises that God made in his covenant with Abraham. 
  * **passed on to** - The promises went from Abraham to his son Isaac, and now to Isaac's son Jacob. Esau did not receive the promises.
