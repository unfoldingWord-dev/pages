==== Translation Notes: ====


  * **God provided for them** – This could be translated as, “God gave them everything they needed for food, water, and shelter.”
  * **bread from heaven, called “manna”** - This thin, bread-like food fell from the sky overnight onto the grass like dew. They called it “manna.” Almost every day the people gathered this “manna” and cooked it as their food.
  * **He also sent flocks of quail…camp** - Another way to say this would be, “He also caused a large number of quails to fly into their camp.” If quails are unknown, a different, similar type bird could be used. Or it could be translated as, “a large number of medium-sized birds.”
  * **their camp** - The place where the Israelites set up their tents to sleep in was called a “camp.” It was like a city with tents instead of buildings, and it could be moved around.
