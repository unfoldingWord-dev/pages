====== Manna from Heaven [14-11] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-14-11.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

During the forty years that the people of Israel wandered in the wilderness, **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]] provided for them**. He gave them **bread from heaven, called “manna.” He also sent flocks of quail** (which are medium-sized birds) **into their camp** so they could have meat to eat. During all that time, God kept their clothes and shoes from wearing out.


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **God provided for them** – This could be translated as, “God gave them everything they needed for food, water, and shelter.” 
  * **bread from heaven, called “manna”** - This thin, bread-like food fell from the sky overnight onto the grass like dew. They called it “manna.” Almost every day the people gathered this "manna" and cooked it as their food. 
  * **He also sent flocks of quail...camp** - Another way to say this would be, “He also caused a large number of quails to fly into their camp.” If quails are unknown, a different, similar type bird could be used. Or it could be translated as, “a large number of medium-sized birds.”   
  * **their camp** - The place where the Israelites set up their tents to sleep in was called a "camp." It was like a city with tents instead of buildings, and it could be moved around.
