====== Gideon's Army [16-12] ======

Then **[[:en:key-terms:gideon|Gideon]]** returned to his soldiers and gave each of them a **horn**, a clay pot, and **a torch**. They surrounded **the place where the [[:en:key-terms:midian|Midianites]] were sleeping**. The **300 men** had the torches in the pots **so the Midianites could not see them**.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **horn** - This could be translated as, “trumpet” or, “ram's horn trumpet.” These horns came from a male sheep and were often used to call men for battle. 
  * **a torch** - This was probably a piece of wood wrapped with cloth and soaked in oil so that it could burn well. (This was not the modern torch that runs on batteries.) 
  * **the place where the Midianites were sleeping** - It may be more clear to say, “the camp where the Midianite soldiers were sleeping.” 
  * **300 men** - Make sure it is clear that these men are the same as the “soldiers” mentioned earlier in this frame. 
  * **so the Midianites could not see them** - That is, “so the Midianites could not see the light of the torches.”
