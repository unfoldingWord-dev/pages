I will give to you and your **[[:en:key-terms:descendant|descendants]] all the land that you can see as an [[:en:key-terms:inherit|inheritance]]**". **Then Abram settled in the land**.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **all the land that you can see** - If Abram was standing on a mountain, he could have seen a very large area. On several occasions God promised to give the entire land of Canaan to Abram and his descendants.
  * **as an inheritance** - This is a figure of speech. God promised to give land to Abram and his descendants as a father gives land and possessions to his children.
  * **Then Abram settled in the land** - Abram lived there along with all those who had gone there with him.
