====== David Murdered Uriah [17-12] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-17-12.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

**[[:en:key-terms:bathsheba|Bathsheba's]]** husband, **[[:en:key-terms:uriah|Uriah]]**, was one of **[[:en:key-terms:david|David's]]** best soldiers. David called Uriah back from the battle and told him to **go be with his wife**. But Uriah refused to go home while the rest of the soldiers were in battle. So David sent Uriah back to the battle and told the general to place him **where the enemy was strongest** so that he would be killed.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **go be with his wife** - That is, “go home to be intimate with his wife.” David wanted people, especially Uriah, to believe that Bathsheba was pregnant with Uriah's child. 
  * **where the enemy was strongest** - That is, the location in the battle where the most fighting was going on.
