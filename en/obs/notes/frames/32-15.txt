===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **power had gone out from him** - This may be translated as, "healing power had flowed from him into someone else" or, "his power had healed someone." Jesus did not lose any power because of this.
  * **Why did you ask, 'Who touched me?'** - In some languages it may be better to use an indirect quote here such as, "Why did you ask who was touching you?" or, "Why you are wondering who touched you?"
