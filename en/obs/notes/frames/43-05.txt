Some of the people **accused the [[:en:key-terms:disciple|disciples]] of being drunk**. But **[[:en:key-terms:peter|Peter]]** stood up and said to them, “Listen to me! These people are not drunk! This **[[:en:key-terms:fulfill|fulfills]]** the **[[:en:key-terms:prophet|prophecy]]** made by the prophet **Joel** in which God said, ‘In **the last days**, I will **pour out my [[:en:key-terms:holy-spirit|Spirit]]**.’”
