Judas was **in charge of the [[:en:key-terms:apostle|apostles']] moneybag**, but he **loved money** and often stole money out of the bag. After Jesus and the disciples arrived in **[[:en:key-terms:jerusalem|Jerusalem]]**, Judas went to the **[[:en:key-terms:jewish-leaders|Jewish leaders]]** and offered to **[[:en:key-terms:betray|betray]]** Jesus to them in exchange for money.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **in charge of the apostles’ moneybag** - That is, “responsible to hold the apostles' money” or, “responsible to hold the bag that had the disciples' money in it and to distribute funds from it.” 
  * **loved money** – That is, “highly valued money” or, “wanted money.” Some languages would not use the same word that can be used for “loved people.”
