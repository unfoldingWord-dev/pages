So **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** **[[:en:key-terms:punish|punished]] both kingdoms** by allowing their enemies to destroy them. The **[[:en:key-terms:kingdom-of-israel|kingdom of Israel]]**  was destroyed by the **[[:en:key-terms:assyria|Assyrian Empire]]**, a powerful, cruel nation. The Assyrians killed many people in the kingdom of Israel, **took away** everything of value, and burned much of the country.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **both kingdoms** - This refers to both the kingdoms of Israel and Judah.
  * **Empire** - A country was called an "empire" when it was powerful enough to extend its authority over many other countries. 
  * **took away** - That is, “stole.” They stole these valuable things and carried them back to Assyria.
