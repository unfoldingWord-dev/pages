===== Important Terms: =====

  * **[[:en:key-terms:disciple|disciples]]**
  * **[[:en:key-terms:jesus|Jesus]]**

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **a ghost** - That is, “a spirit.” They thought Jesus was a spirit, since normally a human being cannot walk on water.
  * **Do not be afraid** – For some languages it may be more natural to say here, “Stop being afraid.”
  * **it is I!** - For some, it might be more natural to translate this as, “It is me, Jesus.”
