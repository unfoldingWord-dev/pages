====== God Went before Israel [12-02] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-12-02.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

**[[:en:key-terms:god|God]] led them** by going ahead of them **as a tall cloud pillar** during the day, which became a **tall fire pillar** at night. God was always with them and **guided them** as they traveled. All they had to do was follow him.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **God led them...as a tall cloud pillar** - Be sure that the translation does not make it sound like the pillar was God. To make this clear, this could be translated as, "God led them...with" or "in a tall cloud pillar."
  * **tall cloud pillar** - This could be translated as, “a tall cloud” or “a cloud shaped like a pillar.” 
  * **tall fire pillar** - This was a column of fire that hung or floated in the air in front of the Israelites. 
  * **guided them** - God showed them the way by making the pillar move along in front of them so they could follow it.
