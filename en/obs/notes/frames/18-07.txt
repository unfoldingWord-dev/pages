===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **tribes of Israel** - The descendants of each of Jacob's twelve sons had become a "tribe" or very large family group in the nation of Israel. Everyone in Israel belonged to one of the twelve tribes.
  * **rebelled against Rehoboam** – That is, “refused to follow Rehoboam as their king.” It might help to start this sentence with "So," or "Because of that," or "Because of what Rehoboam said.” 
  * **remained faithful to him** – That is, “stayed loyal to him” or “continued to support him as king.”
