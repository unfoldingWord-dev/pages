====== The Attempt to Kill Jesus [26-07] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-26-07.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

The people of **[[:en:key-terms:nazareth|Nazareth]]** dragged **[[:en:key-terms:jesus|Jesus]]** out of the **place of [[:en:key-terms:worship|worship]]** and brought him to the edge of a cliff to throw him off of it in order to kill him. **But Jesus walked through the crowd** and left the town of Nazareth.


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **place of worship** - That is, “the building where the Jewish people gathered to worship God.” This can also be translated as "worship building." See how you translated it in **[[:en:obs:notes:frames:26-02|[26-02]]]**. 
  * **But Jesus walked through the crowd** - “But” could be translated with a strong contrast word or phrase such as “But instead” or, “However” to show that the people were not able to do to Jesus what they had planned to do.
