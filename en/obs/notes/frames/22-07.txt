===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Elizabeth** - See the  note about Elizabeth on **[[:en:obs:notes:frames:22-05|[22-04]]]**.
  * **Praise God** - That is, "We should all praise God."
  * **will be called** - This is another way of saying, “will be” or, “will be known as.” John would actually be the Prophet of the Most High God.
  * **the prophet** - That is, “the very important prophet." John would be the prophet that the Old Testament prophets had predicted would come before the Messiah.
  * **Most High God** - Another way to say this would be, “the God who is greater than everything” or, “the God who rules over everything.”
