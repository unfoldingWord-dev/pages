{{:en:obs:obs-15-07.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

The **[[:en:key-terms:israel|Israelites]]** were angry when they found out that the **[[:en:key-terms:gibeon|Gibeonites]] had tricked them**, but they kept the **[[:en:key-terms:peace|peace]]** treaty they had made with them because it was a **[[:en:key-terms:promise|promise]]** before **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]**. Some time later, the **[[:en:key-terms:king|kings]]** of another people group in **[[:en:key-terms:canaan|Canaan]]**, the **[[:en:key-terms:amorite|Amorites]]**, heard that the Gibeonites had made a peace treaty with the Israelites, so they **joined their armies** and attacked **[[:en:key-terms:gibeon|Gibeon]]**. The Gibeonites **sent a message to [[:en:key-terms:joshua|Joshua]] asking for help**.
