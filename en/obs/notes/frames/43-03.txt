  * **[[:en:key-terms/believer|believers]]**
  * **[[:en:key-terms/holy-spirit|Holy Spirit]]**


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **a sound like a strong wind** - That is, “a noise that a strong wind makes” or, “the sound that the wind makes when it blows hard.”
  * **filled with the Holy Spirit** - That is, “given ability by the Holy Spirit” or, “given power by the Holy Spirit.”
  * **in other languages** - This could be translated as, “in languages other than their own language” or, “in foreign languages” or, “as people from other places speak.” The believers did not know these languages until the Holy Spirit gave them the power to speak them. Make sure the word used to translate “languages” refers to languages people actually speak and understand.
