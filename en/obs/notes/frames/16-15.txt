====== An Offering for Gideon [16-15] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-16-15.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

The people wanted to make **[[:en:key-terms:gideon|Gideon]]** their **[[:en:key-terms:king|king]]**. Gideon **refused their offer**, **but he asked them** for some of the gold rings that each of them had taken from **the enemy**. **Gideon received a lot of gold**.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **refused their offer** -  This could be translated as, “did not allow them to do this.” Gideon knew that it was better for the Israelites to have God as their king.
  * **but he asked them** – This phrase starts with “but” because what he did next was not wise. 
  * **the enemy** - That is, the Midianites. 
  * **Gideon received a lot of gold** – It may be more clear to say, “Gideon received a lot of gold from the people” or, “The people gave Gideon a large amount of gold.”
