{{:en:obs:obs-16-01.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


After **[[:en:key-terms:joshua|Joshua]]** died, the **[[:en:key-terms:israel|Israelites]]** **[[:en:key-terms:disobey|disobeyed]]** **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]] and did not drive out the rest of the [[:en:key-terms:canaan|Canaanites]] or [[:en:key-terms:obey|obey]] [[:en:key-terms:gods-law|God's laws]]**. The Israelites began to **[[:en:key-terms:worship|worship]]** the Canaanite **[[:en:key-terms:god-false|gods]]** instead of **[[:en:key-terms:yahweh|Yahweh]]**, **the [[:en:key-terms:true|true]] God**. The Israelites had no **[[:en:key-terms:king|king]]**, so everyone did **what they thought was right for them**.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **and did not drive out** – This tells how they disobeyed God, so in some languages it may be better to start this as a new sentence, “They did not.” 
  * **drive out the rest of the Canaanites** - This can be translated, "fight with the rest of the Canaanites to force them to leave the land.” 
  * **or obey God's laws** - This means that the people also disobeyed the laws that God gave to the Israelites at Mount Sinai.
  * **the true God** - That is, “the only real God.” Yahweh is the only one that people should worship. 
  * **what they thought was right for them** – This means that they all did whatever they wanted to do, including many evil things.
