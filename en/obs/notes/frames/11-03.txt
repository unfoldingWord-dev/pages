====== Blood on the Door [11-03] ======

Then the **[[:en:key-terms:israel|Israelites]]** **needed to put** some of its **[[:en:key-terms:blood|blood]]** around the door of their house. **They were to roast** the meat and eat it quickly, along with bread that was **made without yeast**. **They were to be ready** to leave **[[:en:key-terms:egypt|Egypt]]** **when they ate**.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **needed to put** – This means they were supposed to do this (because God told them to). To make this clear it could be translated as, “Then, as God had told them, the Israelites needed to put some of its blood…”
  * **They were to roast** - They were supposed to do this (because God told them to). To make this clear it could be translated as, “God told them to roast…”
  * **made without yeast** – Yeast is something that is mixed into bread dough to make bread rise as it cooks. This could be translated as, “made without something that would make it rise.” Making the bread with yeast would have taken much longer, so cooking the bread without yeast was a way to be prepared to leave Egypt quickly. 
  * **they were to be ready** - It may be more clear to say, “God told them to be ready…” 
  * **when they ate** – This means they needed to be prepared to leave before they started to eat.
