**Through the [[:en:key-terms:prophet|prophet]] [[:en:key-terms:jeremiah|Jeremiah]]**, **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** **[[:en:key-terms:promise|promised]]** that he would make a **[[:en:key-terms:covenant-new|New Covenant]]**, **but not like** the **[[:en:key-terms:covenant|covenant]]** God made with **[[:en:key-terms:israel|Israel]]** at **[[:en:key-terms:Sinai|Sinai]]**. In the New Covenant, God would **write his law on the people’s hearts**, the people would **know God**, they would **be his people**, and God would **[[:en:key-terms:forgive|forgive]]** their **[[:en:key-terms:sin|sins]]**. The **[[:en:key-terms:messiah|Messiah]]** would **start the New Covenant**.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **Through the prophet Jeremiah God promised** – This could be translated as, “Through the messages that God gave to Jeremiah, God promised” or, “The prophet Jeremiah told the people God's promise.”  
  * **but not like** - The New Covenant would be truly effective. People really would know God, they would truly live as his people, and He would forgive their sins completely, based on the Messiah's sacrifice of himself one time for all who believe in him. 
  * **write his law on the people’s hearts** - This is a metaphor meaning, “help his people to understand his laws and to earnestly desire to obey them.” If possible, keep the image of writing on their hearts, since this is in contrast with the way God had written his law on stone tablets for the Israelites. If that is not possible, you could just translate the meaning. 
  * **know God** - That is, they would “know God personally.”
  * **be his people** - This could be translated as, “be his special people” or, “be his favored people.” 
  * **start the New Covenant** - That is, “be the one to cause the New Covenant to take effect" or, "bring the New Covenant to his people."
