====== Open Bible Stories, The App ======

//**[[https://github.com/dsmedia/OBS-Mobile]]**//

//Open Bible Stories wants to be a picture flipboard with the text of each segment overlayed over the picture and all of it wrapped in a mobile app. We have a proof-of-concept Android app, built using [[http://phonegap.com|PhoneGap]], that can be used as a starting point.//


The app needs to:

  * use the latest version of Open Bible Stories (with 50 stories)
  * start as a basic application with no images and with English story text as a default
  * enable a user to download the images for each story and store them locally
  * enable a user to download new and updated translations of the stories in any language available on Door43
  * flip the "pages" of the story from side to side, with each page a fullscreen image, landscape orientation
