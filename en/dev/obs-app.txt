====== Open Bible Stories, The App ======

//Open Bible Stories wants to be a picture flipboard with the text of each segment overlayed over the picture and all of it wrapped in a mobile app. We have a proof-of-concept Android app, built using [[http://phonegap.com|PhoneGap]], that can be used as a starting point.//
