====== OBS Book Render ======

//Open Bible Stories starts out as plain text, translated into any language using [[http://door43.org/en/obs|Door43]]. The text is combined with images on Door43 to create webpages with illustrations. The function of the **OBS Book Render** utility is to convert the translated text and images into an Open Document file that can be post-processed and printed as a book.//

===== History =====

The English ver. 1.0 of Open Bible Stories was rendered using a PHP library that calls the pandoc engine
