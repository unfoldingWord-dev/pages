====== OBS Book Render ======

//Open Bible Stories starts out as plain text, translated into any language using [[http://door43.org/en/obs|Door43]]. The text is combined with images on Door43 to create webpages with illustrations. The function of the **OBS Book Render** utility is to convert the translated text and images into an Open Document file that can be post-processed and printed as a book.//

===== History =====

The English ver. 1.0 of Open Bible Stories was rendered using a PHP library that retrieved the HTML of Open Bible Stories by "screen-scraping" the old Door43 website, then running it through the pandoc text-formatting engine (see the "Resources" section below).

===== Objective =====

We want to be able to run a script in the **Door43 Tools** collection that automatically renders a translation of Open Bible Stories as an OpenDocument Text file, with these considerations:

  * **images** – includes the images from Open Bible Stories on Door43, available [[https://github.com/Door43/media/tree/master/en/obs|here]]. //Note: The images should be scaled to fit the page perfectly without need for adjusting the image size.//

  * **formatted** – is formatted for printing on the Publish4All print-on-demand system, with a final page size of 8" x 5.25". //Note: pandoc can render OpenDocument text using a pre-formatted template, see the "Resources" section.//

  * **page breaks** – the pages should break correctly, following the format of the original print-ready version (download [[http://distantshoresmedia.org/assets/obs/obs-en_1.0.pdf|here]]).


===== Implementation =====

Instead of screen-scraping, we want to be able to directly process the text files on the Door43 translation platform. Door43 is a Dokuwiki server, meaning all the pages on the site are actually plaintext files with minimal markup on the filesystem of the webserver.

The Dokuwiki text files can be processed directly (see https://github.com/Door43/pages) or rendered as Markdown files available via Github: https://github.com/Door43/exports/tree/master/en/obs/markdown. (Note: rendered using the 'markdown' utility: https://github.com/Door43/tools/tree/master/obs/markdown.)
