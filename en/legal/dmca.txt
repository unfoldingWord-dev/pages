===== Copyright Infringement Notification Basics =====

If you believe your copyright-protected work was posted on Door43 without authorization, you may submit a copyright infringement notification. These requests should only be submitted by the copyright owner or an agent authorized to act on the owner’s behalf.

If you choose to request removal of content by submitting an infringement notification, please remember that you are initiating a legal process. **Do not make false claims.** Misuse of this process may result in legal consequences.

===== Copyright Infringement Notification Requirements =====

Copyright notifications must include the following elements. Without this information, we will be unable to take action on your request:

==== 1. Your contact information ====

You’ll need to provide information that will allow us to contact you regarding your complaint, such as an email address, physical address or telephone number.

==== 2. A description of your work that you believe has been infringed ====

In your complaint, be sure to clearly and completely describe the copyrighted content you are seeking to protect. If multiple copyrighted works are covered in your complaint, the law allows a representative list of such works.

==== 3. Each allegedly infringing page's specific URL ====

Your complaint must contain the specific URL of the page you believe infringes your rights, or we will be unable to locate and remove it. General information about the page, such as title or username, is not adequate. Please include the URL(s) of the exact page(s). The URL should be in the following format: door43.org/<pagename>.

==== 4. You must agree to and include the following statement: ====

“I have a good faith belief that the use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.”

==== 5. And the following statement: ====

"The information in this notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, I am the owner, or an agent authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.”
