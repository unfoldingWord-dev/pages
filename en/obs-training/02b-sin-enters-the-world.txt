====== 2b. Sin Enters the World (simplified) ======


(LS. I have an even more simplified version 2c that I prefer in my sandbox)


===== Introduction =====


This section will give you important background information that will help you translate the story accurately. (LS. suggest we combine this section into a single "Overview" section)


==== Overview: ====


This story explains the source of sin and suffering. God created a perfect world for Adam and Eve. However, they were not satisfied. They wanted to be "like God." When the snake tempted them, they willingly ate the only fruit that was forbidden. They immediately became fearful and ashamed, and tried to hide from God. He punished them for their disobedience with a curse that continues until today. He also removed them from the garden so they would not live forever in their sinful condition.


==== Emphasis of the story: ====


expanded statement (LS. suggest this is covered adequately by the "Overview")


==== Theological Study ====


key theological points, expanded in link â€¦ [[:en:obs-training:theological:02-sin-enters-the-world|(... learn more)]] (LS. suggest we skip this section in Frames. The content would better fit as a discipleship resource linked to the main OBS stories. We can cover any theological issues that are key to translation in the individual frames.)
