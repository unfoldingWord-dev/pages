======Distinguishing Features======

===The distinguishing features of the TFT translation are:===
  * Short sentences
  * Clear connections between clauses and sentences
  * Sometimes clause order is reversed to reflect more clearly the chronological or logical order
  * All abstract nouns are made into full clauses
  * Most passive constructions have an active form and a passive form supplied
  * Most rhetorical questions have both a question form and a non-question form supplied
  * All figures of speech that we have been able to identify are stated non-figuratively
  * Simple vocabulary is used wherever possible
  * Words are always used in their primary sense
  * The implicit information that is deemed necessary to understand what the original writer intended to convey is supplied in **//italics//**. Users can identify it easily and decide after checking whether it is needed in that receptor language.
