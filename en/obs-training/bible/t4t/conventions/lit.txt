======li·to·tes [līˈtōtēz]======

====Litotes is an emphatic statement made by saying that the opposite idea is not true.====

Examples:

**1 Thessalonians 2:1**\\
For you yourselves know, brothers and sisters, about our coming to you--it has not proven to be purposeless. NET\\
You know, brothers, that our visit to you was not a failure.  NIV\\
My fellow believers, you know that our time with you was very worthwhile/effective. TFT\\

In this example of litotes, Paul emphasized that his visit with them was very successful by saying that it was not a failure.
