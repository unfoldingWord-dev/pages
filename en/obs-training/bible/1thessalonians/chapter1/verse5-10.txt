====== 1 Thessalonians 1:5-10 ======

====Reminiscences====

Summary: // The Holy Spirit enabled us to powerfully tell you the good message, and although people persecuted you greatly, you were joyful. As a result, you inspired all the believers who are in Macedonia and Achaia to trust in God firmly, as you do.//

**5** in that our gospel did not come to you merely in words, but in power and in the Holy Spirit and with deep conviction (surely you recall the character we displayed when we came among you to help you). **6** And you became imitators of us and of the Lord, when you received the message with joy that comes from the Holy Spirit, despite great affliction. **7** As a result you became an example to all the believers in Macedonia and in Achaia. **8** For from you the message of the Lord has echoed forth not just in Macedonia and Achaia, but in every place reports of your faith in God have spread, so that we do not need to say anything. **9** For people everywhere report how you welcomed us and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God **10** and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, Jesus our deliverer from the coming wrath.

Here is the passage expanded to help the translator. The italic bold words indicate what the original writer intended to convey. \\

**5** We know that he chose you because when we told that message to you, we did not speak only words. The Holy Spirit helped us to speak powerfully/effectively, and he strongly assured us that he was powerfully working in you by means of the message about Christ that we told to you. You yourselves know that, because you know how we spoke and how we conducted ourselves when we were with you, in order that we might help you. \\

**6** We also know that God chose you because we have now heard that you have endured your troubles when people caused you to suffer very much because you believed in Christ. You endured just like the Lord Jesus Christ endured, and just like we did when people caused us to suffer. At that time you were joyful because the Holy Spirit caused you to be joyful. \\

**7** As a result of your  joyfully enduring your troubles, all the believers who live in Macedonia and Achaia provinces have heard how firmly you trust God. So they know that they should firmly trust in God as you do. \\

**8** Other people have heard you tell the message from the Lord Jesus. Then they also have proclaimed the message to people who live throughout Macedonia and Achaia provinces. Not only that, but people who live in many far-away places [HYP] have heard that you trust in God. As a result, we do not need to tell people what God has done in your lives.\\ 

**9** People who live far from you are telling others what happened when we were with you. They also report that you stopped worshipping things that ◄you/your ancestors► considered to be gods and now you worship God. As a result, you serve the God who is all-powerful and who is the real God. \\

**10** They tell us that now you wait expectantly for his Son to return to earth from heaven. You firmly believe that God caused him to live again after he died. You believe also that Jesus will rescue all of us, who trust in him, from God's punishing us [MTY].
