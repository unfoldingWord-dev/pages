====== 1 Thessalonians 3:1-5 ======

Summary: //When I could no longer endure worrying about you, I sent Timothy to you in order to find out whether or not you were still trusting in God.//

1 As a result of that, when I could no longer endure worrying about you, I decided that Silas and I would stay behind alone in Athens city, 

2 and we two sent Timothy to you. You know that he is our close associate and also works for God by proclaiming the message about Christ. Silas and I sent him in order that he would urge you to continue to strongly trust in Christ. 

3 We wanted that none of you would consider turning away from Christ as a result of people causing you to suffer. You know that God has planned that we who trust in him will suffer like that when people do that to us who trust in him. 

4 Remember that when we were present with you, we kept telling you that we would be persecuted {that people would cause us to suffer}. And because that is what happened, you know that what we said was true! 

5 I was afraid that Satan, the one who tempts us, had caused you to stop trusting in Christ. If that had happened, we would have worked uselessly while we were present with you! So I sent Timothy to you in order to find out whether or not you were still trusting in Christ. I sent him because I could no longer endure not knowing ◄about your spiritual condition/whether or not you were still trusting in Christ►.
