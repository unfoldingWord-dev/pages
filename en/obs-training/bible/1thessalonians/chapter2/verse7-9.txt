====== 1 Thessalonians 2:7 - 9 ======

====The Preacher's Maintenance====

Summary: //You and God know that it is true that we behaved in a very virtuous, upright, and irreproachable manner toward you. //

7 although we could have demanded that you should honor/respect us, because we are apostles who represent (OR, speak for) Christ. On the contrary, we were gentle when we were among you, as a mother gently takes care of her own children [SIM]. 

8 So, because we love you, we were delighted to personally tell you the good message that God gave us. But also we were delighted to lovingly do all that we could do to help you [SYN] because ◄you had become very dear to us/we had begun to love you very much►. 

9 My fellow believers, you remember that we worked very hard [DOU] in order to ◄support ourselves/earn money to buy what we needed► while we were with you. We worked during the day and also at night in order that we would not have to ask any one of you to give us what we needed, while we proclaimed to you the good message that God gave us.
