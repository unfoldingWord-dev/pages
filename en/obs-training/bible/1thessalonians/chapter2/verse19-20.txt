======= 1 Thessalonians 2:19 - 20 =======

====Paul's Joy in the Thessalonians====

Summary: //It is because of you that we are pleased and joyful. So when people forced Silas, Timothy and me to be separated from you for a short time, we strongly desired to be with you.//

19 We were strongly desiring to be with you, because truly you [RHQ] are the ones about whom we are proud and are joyful! It is because we are confident that you will ◄remain faithful/continue believing in God► that we will be joyful! You are the ones who we confidently expect will keep strongly trusting in God! It is because you will ◄remain faithful/continue believing in God► that we will be proud of the work that we have done [MET, RHQ] when our Lord Jesus examines what we all have done, at the time when he comes back to earth! 

20 Indeed, it is because of you that even now we are pleased and are joyful!
