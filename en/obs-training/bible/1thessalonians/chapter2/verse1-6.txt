====== 1 Thessalonians 2:1 - 6 ======


==== The Preachers' Motives ====


Summary: //You and God know that it is true that we behaved in a very virtuous, upright, and irreproachable manner toward you. // 


1 My fellow believers, you know that our time with you was very **worthwhile/effective**.


2 Although people in Philippi city previously mistreated us(exc) and insulted us, as you know, our God caused us to be courageous. As a result, we told you the good message that originates/comes from God, even though some people in your city also strongly ◄opposed us/tried to prevent us from telling God's message►.


3 When we exhorted/urged (OR, tried to convince) you to obey God's message, we did not speak to you an untrue message. Instead, we spoke a true message. We do not want to get something for ourselves by immoral means. We do not try to deceive you or other people.


4 On the contrary, we tell God's message because he trusted us to do that, because he examined us and considered usto be acceptable to tell people the message about Christ. As we teach people, we do not say what they like to hear. Instead, we say what God wants us to say, because he examines everything that we think and what we desire.


5 We never ◄flattered you/said nice things about you insincerely►, as you know. We were never greedy, so we never needed to use words to ◄hide greediness from you/cause you to think that we were not greedy►. God knows that this is true!


6 We never tried to get people to honor us,
