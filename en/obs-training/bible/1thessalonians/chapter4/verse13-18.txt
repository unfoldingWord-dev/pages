====== 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18 ======

Summary: //God will cause to live again those believers who died and will bring them to the sky with Jesus. Encourage each other by telling this message.//

  - 13 My fellow believers, we also want you to understand well [LIT] what will happen to our fellow believers who now are dead [EUP]. You must not be/do like the unbelievers. They grieve deeply for people who die because they do not confidently expect people to live again after they die. 
  - 14 We believers know that it is true that Jesus died and that he rose to live again. So we also know well that God will cause those believers who died [EUP] to live again. We know that he will cause them to go to heaven (OR, come) with Jesus as a result of God's commanding them to arise and ◄go to/come with► Jesus. 
  - 15 I write this because the Lord Jesus revealed to me what I am now telling you. Some of you may think that when the Lord Jesus comes back, he will consider that we believers who are still living will be superior to those believers who have died [EUP], because we will meet Jesus first. That is certainly not true! 
  - 16 It is the Lord Jesus himself who will descend from heaven. When he comes down, he will command all of us believers to rise. The chief angel will shoutwith a loud voice, and another angel will blow a trumpet for God. Then (OR, As a result), the first thing that will happen is that the people who trusted in Christ before they died will live again. 
  - 17 After that, God will powerfully take up into the clouds all of us believers who are still living on this earth. He will take us and those other believers who have died, in order that we all might together meet/welcome the Lord Jesus in the sky. As a result of that, we all will be with him forever. 
  - 18 Because all this is true, encourage/comfort each other by ◄sharing this teaching with each other/reminding each other of this teaching►.
