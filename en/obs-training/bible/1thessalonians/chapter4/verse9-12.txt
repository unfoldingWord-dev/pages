====== 1 Thessalonians 4:9-12 ======

Summary: //We urge you to increasingly love each other, to strive to work at your own occupations, and not meddle in others' affairs.//

  - 9 I want to urge you againthat you should love your fellow believers [MET]. You do not really need that anyone write to you about that, because God has already taught you how to love each other, 
  - 10 and because you already are showing that you love your fellow believers [HYP] who live in other places in your province of Macedonia. Nevertheless, my fellow believers, we urge you to increasingly love each other. 
  - 11 We urge you also to eagerly strive/try to attend to your own affairs and to not meddle/interfere with the affairs of others. We urge you also to work at your own occupations/jobs to earn what you need to live. Remember that we taught you previously to live like that. 
  - 12 If you do these things, unbelievers will acknowledge/see that you behave decently/properly, and you will not have to depend on others to ◄supply/give to you► what you need.
