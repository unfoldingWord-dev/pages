====== 1 Thessalonians 4:1-2 ======

//Just like we told you previously, we strongly urge you to increasingly behave in a way that will please God.
//


Now, my fellow believers, **//I want to write//** about some other matters. Because we all have a close relationship with the Lord Jesus, **we //strongly urge you//** to conduct your lives in a way that pleases God. We taught you to do that, and you know that we did that as a result of what the Lord Jesus **//told us to say//**. We know that you are conducting your lives that way, but **//we strongly urge//** that you do that even more.
