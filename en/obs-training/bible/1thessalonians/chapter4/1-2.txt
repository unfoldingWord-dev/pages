====== 1 Thessalonians 4:1-2 ======

//Just like we told you previously, we strongly urge you to increasingly behave in a way that will please God.
//


Now, my fellow believers, I want to write about some other matters. Because we all have a close relationship with the Lord Jesus, we(exc) strongly urge you [DOU] to conduct your lives in a way that pleases God. We taught you to do that, and you know that we did that as a result of what the Lord Jesus told us to say. We know that you are conducting your lives that way, but we strongly urge that you do that even more.

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **the beginning** - That is, "the beginning of all things," before anything existed except God.
