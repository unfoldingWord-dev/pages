Summary: //Evaluate all messages that people claim that the Holy Spirit gave them. Accept authentic messages and obey them.//

  - 19 Do not refuse the urging from God's Spirit when he is working [MTY] among you. That would be like throwing water on a fire [MET]! 
  - 20 Specifically, do not despise messages that the Holy Spirit reveals to someone and reject them automatically. 
  - 21 On the contrary, evaluate all such messages. Accept the messages that are truly from God, and obey them. 
  - 22 Do not obey any kind of evil message.
