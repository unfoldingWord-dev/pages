====== 1 Thessalonians 5:12-13 ======

Summary: //Recognize as leaders those people who care for and instruct you; highly esteem and love them. Live peacefully with each other.//


12 My fellow believers, we three ask that you recognize/honor as leaders those people who work hard for you. Specifically, respect those who lead you as fellow believers who ◄have a close relationship with/are united to► the Lord Jesus. They warn you to stop doing what is wrong (OR, they teach you to do what is right). 

13 That is, we ask that you consider those leaders to be very important and that you love them, because they work hard to help you. We also urge you to live peacefully with each other.
