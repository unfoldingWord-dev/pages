====== 1 Thessalonians 5:14-15 ======

Summary: //Warn believers who will not work, and encourage and help those who need it. Be patient with all people. Do good deeds to them all, including those who do evil deeds to you.//


14 My fellow believers, we urge that you warn believers who will not work in order to ◄obtain/earn the money to buy► things that they need to live. Tell them that they are behaving wrongly. We urge you that you encourage believers who are fearful (OR, discouraged), and that you help all people who are weak in any way. We also urge you to be patient with everyone. 

15 Make sure that none of you does evil deeds to anyone who has done evil to you. On the contrary, you must always try to do good deeds to each other (OR, to fellow believers) and to everyone else.
