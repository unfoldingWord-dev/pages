==== 1 Thessalonians 5:23-24 ====


Sumary: //We pray that God will cause you to be distinct people who behave right in every way, and I am sure that he will do this.// 


    - 23 We pray to God that he will change you to become more and more like his people should be. He is the one who causes his people to have inner peace. That is, we pray that he will help you so that in all that you think, in all that you desire, and in all that you do, you will be without fault. We ask him that he will keep doing that until our Lord Jesus Christ comes back to earth.
    - 24 Because God has invited you to be his people, you can certainly trust him to keep on helping you in that way.
