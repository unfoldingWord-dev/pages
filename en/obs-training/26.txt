====== 26. Jesus Starts His Ministry ======


===== Overview: =====

Jesus began his ministry in the region of Galilee. There he went to worship in Nazareth where he had grown up. Jesus said that he was the Messiah that the prophet Isaiah wrote about. But the people did not believe him. Instead, they tried to kill Him. So Jesus left them and went to other places to teach, to heal, and to do miracles.  He chose twelve men to be his disciples and to learn from him.
