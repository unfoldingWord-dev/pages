====== Formatting Content ======

**DokuWiki** supports some simple markup language, which tries to make the files to be as readable as possible. This page contains the possible syntax you may use when editing the pages. Simply have a look at the source of this page by pressing "Edit this page". If you want to try something, just use the [[playground:playground|playground]] page. 

===== Basic Text Formatting =====

DokuWiki supports **bold**, //italic//, __underlined__ and ''monospaced'' texts. Of course you can **__//''combine''//__** all these.

two backslashes are only recognized at the end of a line\\
