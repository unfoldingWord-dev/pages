When God created the world, everything was perfect. There was no sin. Adam and Eve loved each other, and they loved God. There was no death or sickness or pain. This was the way God wanted things to be.

{{:en:obs:obs-48-02.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

Satan, who was the snake in the garden, deceived Eve, and she and Adam sinned against God. Because they sinned, death, sickness, and pain all became part of life for everyone on earth.

Even worse, their relationship with God was broken. Now, everyone is born an enemy of God because of sin. But God had a plan to fix everything that had been broken by sin.

God promised that one of Eve’s descendant would crush Satan’s head, and Satan would wound his heel. This meant that Satan would kill Jesus, but God would raise him to life after three days. Jesus would crush the power of Satan forever.

When God destroyed the whole earth in the flood, He provided the boat as a way of salvation for those who believed in Him. In the same way, though everyone deserves to be destroyed for their sins, God has provided a way of salvation for everyone who believes in Jesus.

Melchizedek was a priest who blessed Abraham. Like Melchizedek, Jesus is a priest, but Jesus is the Great High Priest. Jesus offered only one sacrifice, himself. This was the only sacrifice needed to take away the sin of the whole world.

God told Abraham, “Through you, all the people groups of the earth will be blessed.” Jesus was a descendant of Abraham. All the people groups of the earth are blessed through Jesus, because everyone who believes in him becomes one of God’s chosen people, a spiritual descendant of Abraham.

God provided a lamb for Abraham to sacrifice instead of Isaac. But God also provided another lamb to sacrifice instead of the whole world. God provided Jesus, the Lamb of God. Everyone deserves to die for their sins, including you! But God provided Jesus as a sacrifice to die instead of you.

When God sent the last plague on Egypt, each Israelite family needed to kill a perfect lamb and spread the blood around their doors. When the angel of God saw the blood, he passed over their houses and did not kill their firstborn sons. This is called the Passover.

Jesus is our Passover Lamb. He was perfect and sinless and was killed at the time of the Passover Feast. When anyone believes in Jesus, the blood of Jesus washes away that person’s sin, and God’s punishment passes over him.

God made a covenant with the Israelites who were His chosen people. In God’s New Covenant, anyone from any people group can become part of God’s chosen people by believing in Jesus.

Moses was a great prophet who proclaimed the Word of God. Like Moses, Jesus is a prophet, but Jesus is the greatest prophet. He is the Word of God.

God promised David that the Messiah would be one of his descendants. Jesus, the Messiah, was that special descendant of David.

{{:en:obs:obs-48-14.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

Like David, Jesus is a king, but Jesus is the king of the universe! He will come again and rule his Kingdom with justice and peace.
