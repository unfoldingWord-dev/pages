====== 28. The Rich Young Ruler ======


===== Overview: =====


A rich young ruler asked Jesus how he could have eternal life. He thought he had kept all of Godâ€™s laws. Jesus told him to sell everything, give the money to the poor, and follow Him. But the man loved his riches and did not want to give them away. So Jesus explained to His disciples that it is difficult for rich people to be saved, but those who follow Jesus will receive a great reward.
