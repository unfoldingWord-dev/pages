The Israelites were very happy to leave Egypt. They were no longer slaves, and they were going to the Promised Land! The Egyptians gave the Israelites gifts of gold and silver and other valuable things. Some people from other nations believed in God and joined the Israelites as they left Egypt.

God led them by going ahead of them as a tall cloud pillar during the day, which became a tall fire pillar at night. God was always with them and guided them as they traveled. All they had to do was follow.

After a short time, Pharaoh and his people changed their minds and wanted the Israelites to be their slaves again. God did this to get glory for Himself by showing that He is more powerful than Pharaoh and his gods.

So Pharaoh and his army chased after the Israelites to make them their slaves again. When the Israelites saw the Egyptian army coming, they realized they were trapped between Pharaoh’s army and the Red Sea. They were very afraid and cried out, “Why did we leave Egypt? We are going to die!”

Moses told the people, “Do not be afraid! God will fight for you today and save you.” Then God told Moses, “Tell the people to move toward the Red Sea.”

The cloud pillar then moved between the Israelites and the Egyptians so the Egyptians could not see the Israelites.

Moses lifted his hand over the sea, and God caused the wind to blow. The wind made the water in the sea separate to the left and the right, making a path through the sea.

The Israelites marched through the sea on dry ground with a wall of water on either side of them.

Then the cloud lifted and the Egyptians saw the Israelites escaping. They decided to chase after them.

{{:en:obs:obs-12-10.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

So they followed the Israelites onto the path through the sea, but God threw the Egyptians into a panic and caused their chariots to get stuck. They shouted, “Run away! God is fighting for the Israelites!”

After the Israelites all made it safely to the other side, God told Moses to stretch out his hand again. When he obeyed, the water fell on the Egyptian army and returned to its normal place. The whole Egyptian army drowned.

When the Israelites saw that the Egyptians were dead, they believed in God and trusted that Moses was a prophet of God.

{{:en:obs:obs-12-13.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

They also rejoiced with much excitement because God had saved them from death and slavery! Now they were free to serve God. The Israelites sang many songs to celebrate their new freedom and to praise God for saving them.

God commanded the Israelites to remember His victory over the Egyptians and their deliverance from slavery by celebrating the Passover Feast every year. They celebrated by killing a perfect lamb, having a big feast, and telling the story of how God had saved them from the Egyptians.
