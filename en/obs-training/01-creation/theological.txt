==== Theological Study ====


**1. The Creation:** The creation story addresses significant theological questions. This page provides expanded information on those topics.
=== Where did I come from? ===


One of the most basic questions that every person has is, "Where did I come from?" This story is the God's answer to that question. God says that he is the source of everything.


This story is not presented as a fable, but as the true account of what really happened.


=== Who is God? ===


God is eternal–existing before anything else. He is the creator of everything else. Therefore, he has complete authority over everything and everyone. He is also all-powerful. He simply spoke the creation into existence.


The reference to the Spirit of God and the plural pronoun "us" begin to open our understanding that God exists in more than one person.


=== What is the nature of human beings? ===


God made people "in His image" to have a special relationship with Him and to enjoy and care for his creation. He created them as male and female to have an intimate, personal relationship with each other, and with him. Relationships are a major theme in the Bible.


God made the woman to be an appropriate helper for the man, formed directly from his body. Her creation from his rib introduces her biblical position "along side" her husband–not over or under him. She completed him, making it possible for him to fulfill God's purpose for his life.


=== What is the role of marriage? ===


God brought Eve to Adam as his wife, and continues to exalt marriage throughout the Bible. Marriage also serves as an example of the believer's relationship to God–Israel is called the wife of God, and and the church is the bride of Christ.


=== Did God create sin? ===


When God completed his work of creation after six days, everything was good. There was no sin or imperfection. Adam and Eve lived in harmony with God, doing his will in the earth. This is the God's intention for us. It will also become the eternal situation of all believers at the end of the God's story.


God provided a special garden for the Adam and Eve where they would have everything they needed for an abundant life. Even today, God continue to provide for us, in spite of the fact that we do not fully obey him.


God placed the tree of the knowledge of good and evil in the garden as a test so Adam and Eve could decide if they were satisfied to live with God's good provision for them. God did not create sin. Everything he made was good. Neither did he force us to be holy. Instead, he allowed Adam and Eve to decide whether to obey him and live, or to sin and die.


=== Why do we set apart a day to worship? ===


God set the seventh day apart as a holy reminder that he completed his work of creation in six days. Throughout scripture, God commands us to do various things in order to remember his character, his faithfulness, and our responsibility to him.
