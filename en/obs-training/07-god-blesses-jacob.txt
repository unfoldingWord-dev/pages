====== 7. God Blesses Jacob ======


===== Overview: =====


Isaac’s younger son, Jacob, valued the blessing of God that was promised to Abraham. Jacob bought the rights of the firstborn from his older brother, Esau, with some food. He also tricked his father, Isaac, into blessing him instead of Esau. Esau was so angry that Jacob fled to Rebekah’s relatives. But God blessed Jacob while he was there, and Jacob eventually returned to Canaan and was reunited with Esau.
