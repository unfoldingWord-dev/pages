{{:en:obs:obs-33-06.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

**This story confused the [[:en:key-terms:disciple|disciples]]**. So **[[:en:key-terms:jesus|Jesus]]** explained, “The seed is the **[[:en:key-terms:word-of-god|Word of God]]**. The path where the seeds fell **is like** people who hear God’s Word, but do not understand it, and the **[[:en:key-terms:satan|devil]]** **takes the word away from them**.”


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **This story confused the disciples.** - That is, "The disciples did not understand this story."
  * **is like** - That is, "represents" or, "refers to."
  * **takes the word away from them** - This may also be translated as, “takes God's word away, causing them to forget it” or, “steals the word from their hearts so they won't believe it and be saved.” You may also add the following: “just as birds eat up the seeds that fall on a path.”
