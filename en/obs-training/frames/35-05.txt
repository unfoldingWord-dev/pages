{{:en:obs:obs-35-05.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

“At that time, **there was a severe famine** in the land where the younger son was, and he had **no money to buy food**. So he took the only job he could find, **feeding pigs**. He was so miserable and hungry that he wanted to eat the pigs’ food.”


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * Jesus continues the story.
  * **there was a severe famine** - That is, “there was very little food.” In some languages this might be translated as, “a severe famine happened.” 
  * **no money to buy food** - Because of the famine, food was very expensive. 
  * **job** - This refers to work that he would do for someone else in exchange for money. If this is not clear, this sentence could start with, “So in order to earn some money, he took the only job.” 
  * **feeding pigs** - That is, "giving food to pigs." That is, “giving food to pigs.” This would have been considered as one of the lowest jobs in society at this time. If your language has a certain word for low status jobs, use that word.
