====== Jesus Is the Son of God [24-09] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-24-09.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

**[[:en:key-terms:god|God]] had told [[:en:key-terms:john-baptist|John]]**, “The **[[:en:key-terms:holy-spirit|Holy Spirit]]** **will come down and rest on** someone you **[[:en:key-terms:baptize|baptize]]**. **He is** the **[[:en:key-terms:god-son|Son of God]]**.” There is only one God. But God is **three persons**, the **[[:en:key-terms:god-father|Father]]**, **[[:en:key-terms:jesus|Jesus]]** the **[[:en:key-terms:god-son|Son]]**, and the Holy Spirit.


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **God had told John** - That is, “Before this, God had told John” or, “Before Jesus came to be baptized, God had told John.” 
  * **He is** – It maybe necessary to say, “That person is.” 
  * **three persons** - This expression refers to the fact that the One God has always continually existed as three interconnected forms, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Do not translate this as, "God is three people" or, "God shifts between forms." Neither of these statements are true. How God is simultaneously one in three is one of the mysteries of the Christian faith.
