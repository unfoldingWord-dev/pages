Suddenly, their eyes were opened, and they realized they were **naked**. They tried to cover their nakedness by sewing leaves together to make clothes.
=== Key Terms: ===


    * **[[:en:key-terms:naked|naked]]**- not having any clothing or covering


=== Translation Notes: ===


Pay close attention to â€¦


    * "//their eyes were opened//" - a figure of speech meaning they now understood a new fact
    * "//they were naked//" - they had always been naked. It was not a problem until now. This indicates that "naked" probably refers not only to their lack of clothing. Now, their actions and emotions were open to God, and displeasing to him.
    * "//cover their nakedness//" - the man and the woman attempted to use leaves to hide their bodies and their sin from God. It was a futile effort. Clothes can not hide us from God's view.
