Suddenly, **their eyes were opened**, and they realized **they were naked**. They tried to **cover their bodies** by sewing leaves together to make clothes.

===== Translation Notes: =====



    * **their eyes were opened** - a figure of speech meaning they now understood something for the first time. In your language, there may be an idiom with similar meaning that you could use to translate this.
    * **realized they were naked** - they had always been naked. It was not a problem until now. But now they understood that all of who they are, both physical and spiritual, was visible to God, and that now they were displeasing to him.
    * **cover their bodies** - the man and the woman attempted to use leaves to hide their bodies and their sin from God. It was a futile effort. Clothes could not hide them from God's view.
