===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **After the people crossed the Jordan River** – In some languages it is better to say, “The people crossed the Jordan River and then…”
  * **how to attack** – This could be translated as, “exactly what he should do to attack…” 
  * **once a day for six days** - That is, they went around the city one time every day for a total of six days.
