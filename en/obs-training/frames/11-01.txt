{{:en:obs:obs-11-01.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

**[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** warned **[[:en:key-terms:pharaoh|Pharaoh]]** that if he did not let the **[[:en:key-terms:israel|Israelites]]** go, then He would kill all the **firstborn males of both people and animals**. When **[[:en:key-terms:pharaoh|Pharaoh]]** heard this he still **refused to [[:en:key-terms:believe|believe]]** **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]**.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **the firstborn males of both people and animals** - This could be translated as, “the eldest son in every family and the first male offspring of any of their animals.”
  * **refused to believe God** – When Pharaoh refused to obey what God wanted him to do, he showed that he did not believe that God would do what he said. It may be more clear to say here, “refused to believe and obey God.”
