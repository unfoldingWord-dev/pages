===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **When Peter and Jesus got into the boat, the wind** – It may be necessary to say, “Peter and Jesus got into the boat, and then the wind.”
  * **worshiped Jesus** – This could be translated as, “bowed down and worshiped Jesus.” This word has the idea of physically bowing down in front of someone out of respect and reverence.
  * **Truly you are the Son of God** – Other ways to say this would be, “You really are the Son of God” or, “It really is true that you are the Son of God.”
  * //A Bible story from// - These references may be slightly different in some Bible translations.
