**God** sent a male and a female of every animal and bird to **Noah** so they could go into the boat and be kept safe during the flood. **God** sent seven males and seven females of every type of animal which could be used for **sacrifices**. When they were all in the boat, **God** Himself closed the door.

  * "//kept safe//" - to not die in the waters of the flood
  * "//seven males and seven females//" - there were seven pairs of animals that would be sacrificed, so there would still be enough to reproduce and fill the earth after some were offered to God
  * "//used for sacrifices//" - killed and offered to God in appreciation for His provision, and to acknowledge that everyone deserves death because of our sin
  * "//God Himself closed the door//" - God closed the door of the ark so that Noah and his family would be safe inside, and so that the sinners who had refused to listen could no longer enter.
