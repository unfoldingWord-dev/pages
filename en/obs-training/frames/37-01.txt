{{:en:obs:obs-37-01.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

**One day**, **[[:en:key-terms:jesus|Jesus]]** received a message that **[[:en:key-terms:lazarus|Lazarus]]** was very sick. Lazarus and his two sisters, **[[:en:key-terms:mary-sister|Mary]]** and **[[:en:key-terms:martha-sister|Martha]]**, were close friends of Jesus. When Jesus heard this news, he said, “**This sickness will not end in [[:en:key-terms:death|death]]**, but **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]] will be [[:en:key-terms:glory|glorified]] by this**.” Jesus **[[:en:key-terms:love|loved]]** his friends, **but he waited where he was for two days**.


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **One day** - This phrase introduces an event that happened in the past, but does not state the specific time. Many languages have a similar way to begin telling a true story.
  * **this sickness will not end in death** - This can also be translated as, “the final result of this sickness will not be death” or, “Lazarus is sick, but death is not the final result of this sickness.” Jesus' disciples probably thought this meant Lazarus would not die. But Jesus meant that though Lazarus would die from his sickness, he would live in the end.
  * **God will be glorified by this** - That is, “this will cause people to praise God for how great he is.” 
  * **but he waited where he was for two days** - This could be translated as “but he stayed where he was for two days, even though they wanted him to go and heal Lazarus.”
