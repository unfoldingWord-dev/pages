====== The Perfect Creation [48-01] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-48-01.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

When **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** **created** the world, everything was **perfect**. There was no **[[:en:key-terms:sin|sin]]**. **[[:en:key-terms:adam|Adam]]** and **[[:en:key-terms:eve|Eve]]** **[[:en:key-terms:love|loved]]** each other, and they loved God. There was no **[[:en:key-terms:death|death]]** or sickness or pain. This was the way God wanted things to be.


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **created** - God made the world and everything in it out of nothing.
  * **perfect** - That is, "exactly as it should be" to accomplish all that God intended for it.
