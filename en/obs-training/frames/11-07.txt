{{:en:obs:obs-11-07.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

**From the firstborn of the prisoner in jail, to the firstborn of [[:en:key-terms:pharaoh|Pharaoh]]**, every firstborn died. **There was much weeping in [[:en:key-terms:egypt|Egypt]]**.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **From the firstborn of the prisoner in jail, to the firstborn of Pharaoh** - This is a way of saying that everyone's firstborn son died – from the son of the least important person to the son of the most important person, and everyone in between.
  * **There was much weeping in Egypt** - Another way to say this would be, “Many people in Egypt were crying and wailing because of their deep sadness.”
