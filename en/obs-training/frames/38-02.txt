===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **in charge of the apostles’ moneybag** - That is, “responsible to hold the apostles' money” or, “responsible to hold the bag that had the disciples' money in it and to distribute funds from it.” 
  * **loved money** – That is, “highly valued money” or, “wanted money.” Some languages would not use the same word that can be used for “loved people.”
