{{:en:obs:obs-23-06.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

That night, there were some **[[:en:key-terms:shepherd|shepherds]]** in a nearby field **guarding their flocks**. Suddenly, a **shining [[:en:key-terms:angel|angel]]** appeared to them, and **they were terrified**. The angel said, “**Do not be afraid**, because I have some **[[:en:key-terms:good-news|good news]]**  for you. The **[[:en:key-terms:messiah|Messiah]]**, the **[[:en:key-terms:lord|Master]]**, has been born in **[[:en:key-terms:bethlehem|Bethlehem]]**!”


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **guarding their flocks** - A "flock" is a group of sheep. The shepherds were caring for their sheep, and protecting them from harm or theft.
  * **shining angel** - The angel appeared in a bright, shining light. This effect would have been magnified by the fact that he appeared at night when it was very dark.
  * **they were terrified** - The appearance of the angel was so frightening that they thought he would destroy them.
  * **Do not be afraid** - The angel quickly assured the shepherds that he had not come to them in order to harm them.
