  * **strengthened the church** - That is, "helped the church to become strong."
  * **One day** - This phrase introduces an event that happened in the past, but does not state the specific time. Many languages have a similar way to begin telling a true story.
  * **Set apart for me ... work** - This could also be translated as, "select Paul and Barnabas to serve me by doing the work."
