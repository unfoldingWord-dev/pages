Sometime later, **[[:en:key-terms:barnabas|Barnabas]]** and **[[:en:key-terms:paul|Saul]]** went to the **city of Antioch** in another country. They taught many people about **[[:en:key-terms:jesus|Jesus]]** and **strengthened the [[:en:key-terms:church|church]]** there.  It was at Antioch that believers in Jesus were first called "**[[:en:key-terms:christian|Christians]]**." **One day**, while the Christians at Antioch were **[[:en:key-terms:fast|fasting]]** and **[[:en:key-terms:pray|praying]]**, the **[[:en:key-terms:holy-spirit|Holy Spirit]]** said to them, “**Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul to do the work I have called them to do**.”

Some believers who fled from the **[[:en:key-terms:persecute|persecution]]** in **[[:en:key-terms:jerusalem|Jerusalem]]** went far away to the **city of Antioch**. They told non-**[[:en:key-terms:jew|Jewish]]** people there about **[[:en:key-terms:jesus|Jesus]]**, and very many of them became believers. **[[:en:key-terms:barnabas|Barnabas]]** and **[[:en:key-terms:paul|Saul]]** went there to teach the new believers more about Jesus and to **strengthen the [[:en:key-terms:church|church]]**.  It was at Antioch that believers in Jesus were first called "**[[:en:key-terms:christian|Christians]]**." **One day**, while the Christians at Antioch were **[[:en:key-terms:fast|fasting]]** and **[[:en:key-terms:pray|praying]]**, the **[[:en:key-terms:holy-spirit|Holy Spirit]]** said to them, “**Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul to do the work I have called them to do**.”

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **city of Antioch** - This was an ancient city located in what is now the southernmost tip of the modern country of Turkey, near its border with Syria and close to the Mediterranean Sea. It was about 450 miles northwest of Jerusalem. Most of the people living there were not Jews. 
  * **strengthened the church** - This could also be translated as, “helped the church to grow strong spiritually” or, “helped the believers in Jesus to grow strong in their faith” or, “helped the people to believe more firmly in Jesus.” 
  * **One day** - This phrase introduces an event that happened in the past, but does not state the specific time. Many languages have a similar way to begin telling a true story.
  * **Set apart for me ...** - This sentence could also be translated as, “Appoint Paul and Barnabas to do the special work I have called them to do.”
