{{:en:obs:obs-01-04.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


On the third day, **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** spoke and separated the water from the dry land. He called the dry land "earth," and He called the water "seas."


===== Emphasis: =====


When God spoke on the third day, his voice caused the waters of the seas to roll back and the dry land to rise up. The earth was now prepared for the living things that God planned to create next.


===== Translation Notes: =====


    * "//day//" - a literal 24-hour period 
    * "//God spoke//" - God created the dry land by means of a simple verbal command 
    * "//separated the water from the dry land" - // in order for different kinds of life to survive, God prepared the chaotic world by making order by dividing the water from dry land and setting the boundaries between sea and shore. Before the animals and fishes were created, God shaped his creation into places in which they could live.
