====== Midian Attacked Israel Again [16-08] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-16-08.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

Then the **[[:en:key-terms:midian|Midianites]]** came again to steal from the **[[:en:key-terms:israel|Israelites]]**. There were so many of them that they **could not be counted**. **[[:en:key-terms:gideon|Gideon]]** called the Israelites together to fight them. Gideon asked **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** for **two signs** so he could be sure that God would use him to **[[:en:key-terms:save|save]]** **[[:en:key-terms:israel|Israel]]**.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **they could not be counted** - This could be translated as, “it would be very difficult to count all of the Midianites.” This idiom emphasizes that there was such a large number of them. 
  * **two signs** - Gideon wanted two miraculous occurrences that would supernaturally confirm that God wanted him to fight against the Midianites.
