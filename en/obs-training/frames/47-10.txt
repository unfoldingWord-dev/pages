When **the jailer** saw that the prison doors were open, he was terrified! He planned to kill himself because he thought all the prisoners had escaped. (He knew he would be killed because he allowed the prisoners to escape.) But **[[:en:key-terms:paul|Paul]]** saw him and yelled, “Stop! Do not hurt yourself. **We** are all here.”


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **the jailer** - That is, "the official in charge of the jail."
  * **We** - Some languages have a special form of the word “we” which does not include the person being talked to. Here the “we” does not include the jailer, only Paul and the rest of the prisoners.
