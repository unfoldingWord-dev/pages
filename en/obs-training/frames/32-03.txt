{{:en:obs:obs-32-03.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

This man was so strong that nobody could control him. People had even **fastened** his arms and legs with chains, but he **kept breaking them**.


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **fastened his arms and legs** - That is, "restrained" or, "bound."
  * **kept breaking them** - Some languages may need to say, "kept breaking the chains."
