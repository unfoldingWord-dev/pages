===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **on behalf of** - This may be translated as, "for the benefit of" or, "in the place of."
  * **as a substitute for the punishment of their sins** - God allowed people to bring animals to sacrifice for their sin as a reminder of the punishment that they deserved and their dependence on God to remove their sin. God accepted these sacrifices as a temporary covering for sin and did not punish the people for it. The priests needed to make these sacrifices regularly, because the people kept sinning. 
  * **perfect sacrifice** - He will offer a sacrifice without any imperfection or lack.
