====== Not the Messiah [24-05] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-24-05.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

Some **[[:en:key-terms:jew|Jews]]** asked **[[:en:key-terms:john-baptist|John]]** if he was the **[[:en:key-terms:messiah|Messiah]]**. John replied, “I am not the Messiah, but there is someone coming after me who is **much greater than I am**. I am **not even worthy to untie his sandals**.”


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **much greater than I am** - This could be translated as "much more important than I am" or, "much more significant person that I am."
  * **not even worthy to untie his sandals** - This idiom means that the Messiah is so great that John, by comparison, is not even worthy to perform the most menial service for him.
