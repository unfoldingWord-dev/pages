===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **declared him to be righteous** - That is, "considered him to be a righteous person." Even though the tax collector was a sinner, God was merciful to him because of his humility and repentance.
  * **will humble** - This could also be translated as, “will give a lower status to” or, “will cause to not be important.” It could be translated figuratively as, “will bring down.” 
  * **will lift up** - That is, “will give a higher position to” or, “will honor.”
  * **humbles himself** - That is, “chooses to behave in a humble way” or, “has a humble attitude about himself.”
