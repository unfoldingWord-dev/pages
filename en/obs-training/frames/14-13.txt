====== Moses Strikes the Rock [14-13] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-14-13.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

One time, the people had no water. God told Moses, “Speak to the rock, and water will come out of it.” But Moses dishonored God in front of all the people by hitting the rock twice with a stick instead of speaking to it. Water came out of the rock for everyone to drink, but God was angry with Moses and said, “You will not enter the Promised Land.”
