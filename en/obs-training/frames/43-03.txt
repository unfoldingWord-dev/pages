====== Speaking Other Languages [43-03] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-43-03.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

While **the believers** were all together, suddenly, they heard a sound like a strong wind that filled the house. Then something that looked like flames of fire appeared over the heads of all the believers. They were all filled with the **[[:en:key-terms:holy-spirit|Holy Spirit]]** and began to speak **in other languages**.


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **the believers** - See the note in **[[:en:obs-training:frames:43-01|[43-01]]]**.
  * **other languages** - This could be translated as, “in languages other than their own language” or, “in foreign languages” or, “as people from other places speak.” Make sure the word used to translate “languages” refers to languages people actually speak and understand. The believers did not know these other languages, but the Holy Spirit gave them the power to speak them.
