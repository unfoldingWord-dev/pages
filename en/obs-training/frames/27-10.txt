“The next day, the **[[:en:key-terms:samaria|Samaritan]]** needed to **continue his journey**. He gave some money to the person **in charge of** the inn and said, ‘**Take care of him**, and if you spend any more money than this, I will **repay those expenses** when I return.’”


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * (Jesus continues to tell the story.)
  * **continue his journey** – This could be translated as, “continue traveling toward his destination.” 
  * **in charge of** – That is, “who managed.” It could be that this person also owned this lodging place. 
  * **Take care of him** – For some languages it may be necessary to say, “Please take care of him” in order for it to be clear that this was a polite request, not an order. 
  * **repay those expenses** – This could also be translated as, “repay you” or, “repay that money” or, “repay it.”
