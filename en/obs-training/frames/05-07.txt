As they **walked to the place of the [[:en:key-terms:sacrifice|sacrifice]]**, **[[:en:key-terms:isaac|Isaac]]** asked, “Father, we have **wood for the [[:en:key-terms:sacrifice|sacrifice]]**, but where is **the [[:en:key-terms:lamb|lamb]]**?” **[[:en:key-terms:abraham|Abraham]]** replied, “**[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** will provide the **[[:en:key-terms:lamb|lamb]]**.”

===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **walked to the place of sacrifice** - God had told Abraham to sacrifice Isaac on a special high hill that was about 3 days' walk from where they lived. 
  * **wood for the sacrifice** - For a sacrifice, normally the lamb was killed and then placed on top of wood so that the wood and the lamb could be burned up with fire.
  * **the lamb** - A young sheep or goat would be the normal animal for a sacrifice. 
  * **provide** - Abraham may have believed that Isaac was the "lamb" that God provided, although God fulfilled Abraham's words by providing a ram to sacrifice in Isaac's place.
