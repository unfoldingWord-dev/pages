Then **[[:en:key-terms:gideon|Gideon]]** returned to **his soldiers** and gave each of them a **horn**, **a clay pot**, and **a torch**. They surrounded the place where the **[[:en:key-terms:midian|Midianites]]** were sleeping. The 300 men had the torches in the pots so the Midianites could not see them.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **his soldiers** - Make sure it is clear that these “soldiers” are the same men as the “300 men” mentioned later in this frame. 
  * **horn** - This could be translated as, “trumpet” or “ram's horn trumpet.” These horns came from a male sheep and were often used to call men for battle. 
  * **a clay pot** - explanation required?
  * **a torch** - explanation required?
  * **The 300 men** - The 300 soldiers that remained with Gideon after he sent home the other men who were afraid.
