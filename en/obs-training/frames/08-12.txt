After **testing them** to see **if they had changed**, **[[:en:key-terms:joseph|Joseph]]** said to them, “I am your brother, **[[:en:key-terms:joseph|Joseph]]**! **Do not be afraid**. You tried to do **[[:en:key-terms:evil|evil]]** when you sold me as a **[[:en:key-terms:servant|slave]]**, but **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** used the **[[:en:key-terms:evil|evil]] for [[:en:key-terms:good|good]]**! Come and live in **[[:en:key-terms:egypt|Egypt]]** so I can provide for you and your families.”


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **testing them** - explanation
  * **if they had changed** - Another way to say this would be, “if they were different than they used to be.” Years ago Joseph's brothers had done a wicked thing when they sold him into slavery. Joseph wanted to find out if they had changed and would now do what was right. 
  * **do not be afraid** - Another way to say this would be, “You do not need to be afraid of me.” Joseph's brothers were afraid because they had greatly wronged Joseph and now as a great ruler he had the power to punish them. Not only did he have the power to refuse to sell them any food, but he could even put them in prison or kill them. 
  * **evil for good** - explanation
