Anyone who **[[:en:key-terms:disobey|disobeyed]]** **[[:en:key-terms:god|God's]] law** could bring an animal **to the [[:en:key-terms:tent-of-meeting|Tent of Meeting]]** as a **[[:en:key-terms:sacrifice|sacrifice]]** to God. A **[[:en:key-terms:priest|priest]]** would kill the animal and burn it on the **[[:en:key-terms:altar|altar]]**. **The [[:en:key-terms:blood|blood]] of the sacrifice covered the person’s [[:en:key-terms:sin|sin]]** and made that person **clean in God's sight**. God chose **[[:en:key-terms:moses|Moses']]** brother, **[[:en:key-terms:aaron|Aaron]]**, **and his [[:en:key-terms:descendant|descendants]]** to be his priests.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **to the Tent of Meeting** - They did not bring the animal inside the Tent of Meeting, but to the altar in front of the Tent of Meeting. Be sure not to use an expression that means that they brought it inside. 
  * **God's law** - This refers to all the commandments and instructions that God had told the Israelites to obey. 
  * **The blood of the sacrifice** - This could be translated as, “The blood of the animal that was sacrificed.”
  * **covered the person’s sin** - When the priest killed an animal, God chose to see the person who brought the animal as if the blood of the animal was covering over his sin. This is like when we hide something that is ugly or dirty by covering it. This could be translated as, “The blood of the sacrifice was like a covering over the person's sin.” 
  * **clean in God's sight** - This could be translated as, “as if he did not have the sin according to God” or "free of the punishment for breaking God's law."  
  * **and his descendants** - This means, “and Aaron's descendants.”
