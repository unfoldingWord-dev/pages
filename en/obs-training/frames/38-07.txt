====== Satan Entered Judas [38-07] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-38-07.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

After **[[:en:key-terms:judas|Judas]]** took the bread, **[[:en:key-terms:satan|Satan]] entered into him**. **Judas left** to help the **[[:en:key-terms:jew|Jewish]]** leaders arrest Jesus. **It was nighttime.**


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Satan entered into him.** - There is considerable debate about the exact meaning of this phrase. Somehow, Satan took control of Judas and cause Judas to do his will. If it will be understood, translate this phrase as literally as possible rather than trying to explain exactly what happened to Judas.
  * **Judas left** - Some languages may need to say, "Judas left the meal" or, "Judas left the room where they were eating."
