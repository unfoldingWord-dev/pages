**Three days later**, after the people had **prepared themselves spiritually**, **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** came down on top of **[[:en:key-terms:sinai|Mount Sinai]]** with thunder, lightning, smoke, and a loud trumpet blast. Only **[[:en:key-terms:moses|Moses]]** was allowed to go up the mountain.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **Three days later** - In other words, three days after they arrived at Mount Sinai and God first spoke to them. 
  * **prepared themselves spiritually** - This refers to ceremonial cleansing in preparation to meet with God. This could be translated as “got ready to meet with God” or “washed themselves in preparation to meet with God.”
