====== The Desire for Riches [33-08] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-33-08.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

“The soil where the seeds fell among thorns represents people who hear **[[:en:key-terms:word-of-god|God’s Word]]**, but as time passes, their **[[:en:key-terms:love|love]]** for **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** is choked out by the **cares**, **riches**, and **pleasures of life**. The teaching they heard does not **produce fruit**.”


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **cares** - That is, "concerns" or, "needs."
  * **riches** - That is, "desire for wealth."
  * **pleasures of life** - This could also be translated as, "the desire to enjoy life."
  * **produce fruit** - This expression refers to the good works that a believer does, as well as the positive changes in his character. If this contrast will be understood in your language, translate this phrase literally with a general word for "fruit." If it will be confusing, you may need to translate it with a phrase such as, "good works" or, "a changed life."
