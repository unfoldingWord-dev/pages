{{:en:obs:obs-15-09.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

**[[:en:key-terms:god|God]] threw the [[:en:key-terms:canaan|Canaanites]] into confusion**. **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** fought for **[[:en:key-terms:israel|Israel]]** that day by sending **large hailstones** that killed many of the Canaanites.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **threw the [[:en:key-terms:canaan|Canaanites]] into confusion** - We are not exactly what God did, but the result was that the Canaanites were not able to fight together effectively against the Israelites.
  * **large hailstones** - "Hailstones" are balls of ice that fall from the sky. These hailstones were apparently large enough to kill soldiers.
