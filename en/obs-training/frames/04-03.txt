{{:en:obs:obs-04-03.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


So **[[:en:key-terms:god|He]]** changed their language into many different languages and spread the people out all over the world. The city they had begun to build was called **[[:en:key-terms:babel|Babel]]**, which means “confused.”


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **So He changed** - pronoun "He" refers to God
  * **changed their language** - the descendent of Noah all spoke the same language, but God miraculously changed it so they began to speak completely different languages and could not understand each other
  * **many different languages** - probably not a different language for each person, but multiple languages with only a small group speaking each one
  * **spread the people** - they could not understand each other, so they naturally separated into groups that spoke the same language, and each group moved to their own area 
  * **confused** - refers to the confusion that resulted from the people no longer being able to communicate with each other in a common language
