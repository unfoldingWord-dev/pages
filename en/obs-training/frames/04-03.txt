===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **changed their language** – In an instant, God miraculously gave them different languages to speak so that suddenly they were no longer able to understand each other.
  * **many different languages** – Instead of one large group of people speaking one language, there were now many smaller people groups each speaking its own separate language. 
  * **spread the people** - When God changed their languages, he caused these groups of people to scatter out on the earth and each group moved to its own area.
  * **Babel** - We don't know the exact location of this city, other than it was somewhere in the ancient Middle East.
  * **confused** - This refers to how the people were confused or, “mixed-up” when they could no longer understand each other after God changed their language.
