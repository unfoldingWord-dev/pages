So **He** changed their language into many different languages and spread the people out all over the world. The city they had begun to build was called **Babel**, which means “confused.”


=== Key Terms: ===

 
  * **[[:en:key-terms:god|He]]** - Almighty, creator, sinless and perfect
  * **[[:en:key-terms:babel|Babel]]** - the ancient Middle-Eastern city where God confused the languages


=== Translation Notes: ===


Pay close attention to ...


  * "//So He changed//" - pronoun "He" refers to God
  * "//changed their language//" - the descendent of Noah all spoke the same language, but God miraculously changed it so they began to speak completely different languages and could not understand each other
  * "//many different languages//" - probably not a different language for each person, but multiple languages with only a small group speaking each one
  * "//spread the people//" - they could not understand each other, so they naturally separated into groups that spoke the same language, and each group moved to their own area 
  * "//confused//" - refers to the confusion that resulted from the people no longer being able to communicate with each other in a common language
