**So [[:en:key-terms:god|He]] changed their language** into **many different languages** and **spread the people** out all over the world. The city they had begun to build was called **[[:en:key-terms:babel|Babel]]**, which means “**confused**.”


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **So He changed** - The pronoun "He" here refers to God. Use the noun for God here if it is more natural in your language.
  * **changed their language** – In an instant, God miraculously gave them different languages to speak so that suddenly they were no longer able to understand each other.
  * **many different languages** – Instead of one large group of people speaking one language, there were now many smaller people groups each speaking its own separate language. 
  * **spread the people** - When God changed their languages, He caused these groups of people to scatter out on the earth and each group moved to its own area.  
  * **confused** - This refers to how the people were confused or “mixed-up” when they could no longer understand each other after God changed their language.
