Ten years after they arrived in **[[:en:key-terms:canaan|Canaan]]**, **[[:en:key-terms:abram|Abram]]** and **[[:en:key-terms:sarah|Sarai]] still did not have a child**. So **[[:en:key-terms:abram|Abram's]]**  wife, **[[:en:key-terms:sarah|Sarai]]** , said to him, "Since the **[[:en:key-terms:yahweh|LORD]]** has not allowed me to have children and now I am too old to have children, here is my **servant, [[:en:key-terms:hagar|Hagar]]**. **Marry her also** so she can **have a child for me**."



===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **still did not have a child** - Without a child, Abram has no descendants to become a great nation.
  * **servant** - Sarai owned Hagar just as she owned clothing and other things. Hagar worked for Sarai and had to do whatever Sarai told her to do.
  * **marry her also** - Abram would take Hagar as a second wife, but Hagar would not have the full status of a wife as Sarai did. She was still Sarai's servant.
  * **have a child for me** - Since Hagar was Sarai's servant, Sarai would be considered the mother of any children that Hagar bore.
