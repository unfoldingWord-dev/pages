====== Jeremiah Suffered for God [19-17] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-19-17.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

Most of the time, the people did not listen. They often mistreated the prophets and sometimes even killed them. Once, the prophet Jeremiah was put into a dry well and left there to die. He sank down into the mud that was in the bottom of the well, but then the king had mercy on him and pulled him out before he died.
