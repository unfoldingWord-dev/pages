====== The Samaritan [27-08] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-27-08.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

**“The next person** to **walk down** that road was a **[[:en:key-terms:samaria|Samaritan]]**. (Samaritans were the descendants of **[[:en:key-terms:jew|Jews]]** who had married people from other nations. Samaritans and Jews hated each other.) But when the Samaritan saw the Jewish man, he was felt very strong compassion for him. So he cared for him and bandaged his wounds.”


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **"The next person** - Jesus continues to tell the story.
  * **walk down** – That is, “travel down.” Some languages may need to use a more specific word such as “travel” so that it doesn't sound like these people were just taking a walk. They were traveling from one city to another.
