So **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** took some dirt, formed it into a man, and breathed **[[:en:key-terms:life|life]]** into him. This man's name was **[[:en:key-terms:adam|Adam]]**. **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** planted a garden where **[[:en:key-terms:adam|Adam]]** could live, and put him there to care for it.


===== Emphasis: =====


God spoke the rest of creation into existence, but He used a more personal method when He made man. He took some dirt and form it into the shape of the man. Then He breathed His breath into the man so that he became alive. He named him Adam and planted a wonderful garden for him. He place Adam in the garden to enjoy it and to care for it and for the earth from which he was formed.

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **took some dirt** - God made man from the dust, or dry dirt from the ground. This was a very humble origin for the human race.
    * **formed it** - An anthropomorphism indicating that God fashioned the man, as if by His hands. This very personal act contrasts the humble material (dirt) and the creation of the animals with a spoken word.
    * **a man** - the man onlyâ€“-the woman was made later by a different method
    * **breathed life** - This is again an anthropomorphism that indicates a very intimate, personal transfer of "life" directly from God into the man's body, making him alive. Generally understood as the God giving man a living spirit.
    * **life** - In the Bible, "life" means a person's spirit is present in their body. When the spirit leaves the body, the person "dies," leaving behind a lifeless body.
    * **Adam** - Adam's name is the same as the Old Testament word for "man," and similar to the word for "dirt" from which he was formed.
    * **garden** - a small area filled with trees and plants for a purpose--usually to produce food or to provide beauty
    * **care for it** - to maintain the garden by tending, weeding, watering, harvesting, planting, etc.
