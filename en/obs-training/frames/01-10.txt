So **God** took some dirt, formed it into a man, and **breathed** **life** into him. This man's name was **Adam**. **God** planted a garden where **Adam** could live, and put him there to care for it.
=== Key Terms: ===


    * **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]**- two words are used together to indicate "the self-existent, eternal Lord of everything" (CJ: first definition is not on God page 10-08) and the "Almighty, creator, sinless and perfect"
    * **[[:en:key-terms:breathe|breathed]]**- God breathed, or blew life into Adam
    * **[[:en:key-terms:life|life]]**- literally, the "breath of life"
    * **[[:en:key-terms:adam|Adam]]**- Adam's name was literally the Hebrew word for "man"
=== Translation Notes: ===


Pay close attention to …


    * "//dirt//" - dust, dry dirt from the ground (LS: moved from KT)
    * "//formed//" - formed or fashioned, as if by his hands (LS: moved from KT)
    * "//man//" - Adam only–Eve was made later (LS: moved from KT) (perhaps the creation of "ADAM" is pointing to the beginning of the human race in the forming ("making of the dust") of this first man. The Hebrew for human being is "ADAM." The first man is the head of our kind. He represents the entirety of the species and when he sinned, we all fell with him. Christ was the second "ADAM" representing our human family in redemption. The creation of EVE was connected to the making of the man, and was the completion of the creation of the human race ("male and female he created them').(TW)
    * "//garden//" - a special collection of trees and plants that God prepared for Adam (LS: moved from KT)
    * "//breathed life into him' //- the life of the man was give by the personal in-filling of his body with the breath that God breathed into him. The other animals were brought into existence simply by the spoken word, but God formed the man (as with his hands forming the body from the dust) and then breathed life into him. The creation of man and woman was a very personal act of God distinguished from all other creatures. (TW)
