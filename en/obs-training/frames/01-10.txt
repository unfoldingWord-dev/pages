So **God** took some dirt, formed it into a man, and **breathed** **life** into him. This man's name was **Adam**. **God** planted a garden where **Adam** could live, and put him there to care for it.
=== Key Terms: ===


    * **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]**- two words are used together to indicate "the self-existent, eternal Lord of everything" (CJ: first definition is not on God page 10-08) and the "Almighty, creator, sinless and perfect"
    * **[[:en:key-terms:breathe|breathed]]**- God breathed, or blew life into Adam
    * **[[:en:key-terms:life|life]]**- literally, the "breath of life"
    * **[[:en:key-terms:adam|Adam]]**- Adam's name was literally the Hebrew word for "man"
=== Translation Notes: ===


Pay close attention to …


    * "//dirt//" - dust, dry dirt from the ground 
    * "//formed//" - formed or fashioned, as if by his hands 
    * "//man//" - Adam only–Eve was made later 
    * "//garden//" - a special collection of trees and plants that God prepared for Adam (LS: moved from KT)
    * "//breathed life into him' //- the life of the man was given by the personal in-filling of God; God breathed into him and he became alive.
