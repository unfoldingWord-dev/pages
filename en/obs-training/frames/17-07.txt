{{:en:obs:obs-17-07.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

But **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** sent **the [[:en:key-terms:prophet|prophet]] [[:en:key-terms:nathan|Nathan]]** to **[[:en:key-terms:david|David]]** with this message, “Because you are a **man of war**, you will not build **this house** for me. Your **[[:en:key-terms:son|son]]** will build it. But, I will **[[:en:key-terms:bless|bless]]** you greatly. Someone from your family will always **sit on the [[:en:key-terms:throne|throne]] of [[:en:key-terms:israel|Israel]]**, and the **[[:en:key-terms:messiah|Messiah]]** will be one of your **[[:en:key-terms:descendant|descendants]]**!” The Messiah is **God’s Chosen One** who would **save the world** from **[[:en:key-terms:sin|sin]]**.


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **the prophet Nathan** – It may be more natural in some languages to say, “a prophet named Nathan.” 
  * **man of war** - That is, “man who fights battles.” David killed many, many people in battle against the Israelites' enemies. God wasn't punishing David, but God wanted a man of peace to build the Temple where people would worship him. 
  * **this house** - That is, “this temple” or “this building for worship” or “this place of worship.” 
  * **sit on the throne of Israel** - This means, “rule as king over Israel.” 
  * **God’s Chosen One** - This means that God had specifically selected the Messiah as the one to save the world.
  * **save the world** - That is, Messiah would save the people of the world.
