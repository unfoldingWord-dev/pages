{{:en:obs:obs-17-07.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

God sent the prophet Nathan to David with this message, “Because you are a man of war, you will not build this house for me. Your son will build it. But, I will bless you greatly. Someone from your family will always sit on the throne of Israel, and the Messiah will be one of your descendants!” The Messiah is God’s Chosen One who would save the world from sin.
