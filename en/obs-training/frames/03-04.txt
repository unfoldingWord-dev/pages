**[[:en:key-terms:noah|Noah]]** **[[:en:key-terms:obey|obeyed]]** **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]**. He and his three sons built the boat just the way **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** had told them. It took many years to build the boat, because it was so big. **[[:en:key-terms:noah|Noah]]** warned the people about the coming flood and told them to turn to **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]**, but they just laughed at him.
