  * **One day** - This phrase introduces an event that happened in the past, but does not state the specific time. Many languages have a similar way to begin telling a true story.
  * **tax collectors** – Tax collectors were considered to be the worst of sinners because often they stole money from people by collecting a higher tax than the government required.
  * **who were with him** – That is, “who were accompanying him.”
