{{:en:obs:obs-09-15.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

**[[:en:key-terms:moses|Moses]] was afraid and did not want to go** to **[[:en:key-terms:pharaoh|Pharaoh]]** because he thought he could not speak well, so **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** sent **Moses’ brother, [[:en:key-terms:aaron|Aaron]]**, to help him. God warned Moses and Aaron that Pharaoh would be **stubborn**.

//A Bible story from: Exodus 1-4//


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **was afraid and did not want to go** - Moses knew that Pharaoh wanted to kill him, and he did not believe that he could do what God wanted him to do.
  * **Moses' brother, Aaron** - Aaron was Moses's actual brother from his Israelite mother and father. Aaron would have been at least several years older than Moses.
  * **stubborn** - This means the Pharaoh would refuse to obey God. It may be necessary to say this in a translation: "stubborn and refuse to listen (or obey).”
  * //A Bible story from// - If all or portions of the Bible have already been translated into your language, check to make sure that these references point to the correct chapters and verses.
