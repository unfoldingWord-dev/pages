==== 03-16. The Rainbow ====

{{:en:obs:obs-03-16.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** then made the first rainbow as a sign of His **[[:en:key-terms:promise|promise]]**. Every time the rainbow appeared in the sky, **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** would remember what He **[[:en:key-terms:promise|promised]]** and so would His people.


=== Translation Notes: ===


  * "//rainbow as a sign//" - the purpose of rainbows is to remind us that God destroyed the world with a flood once, but will not do it again
  * "//what He promised//" - when He sees the rainbow, God will also remember his promise not to destroy the world again by a flood
