**[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** then made the first rainbow as **a sign of His [[:en:key-terms:promise|promise]]**. **Every time** the rainbow appeared in the sky, **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** would remember **what He [[:en:key-terms:promise|promised]]** and so would His people.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **a sign** - Something (such as an object or event) that gives a certain meaning or which points to something that is true or will happen.
  * **as a sign of His [[:en:key-terms:promise|promise]]** – Some languages may need to say, “to show that He had promised….”
  * **Every time** – Make sure it is clear that this means every time a rainbow appeared from that time on. It may be necessary to add, “From then on, every….”
  * **what He [[:en:key-terms:promise|promised]]** - This refers back to the previous frame in which God promised to never again destroy the earth with a flood.
