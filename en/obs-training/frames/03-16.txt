**God** then made the first rainbow as a sign of His **promise**. Every time the rainbow appeared in the sky, **God** would remember what He **promised** and so would His people.


=== Key Terms: ===

 
  * **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** - Almighty, creator, sinless and perfect
  * **[[:en:key-terms:promise|promise]]** - a covenant, promise, or binding agreement between two or more people


=== Translation Notes: ===


Pay close attention to ...


  * "//rainbow as a sign//" - the purpose of rainbows is to remind us that God destroyed the world with a flood once, but will not do it again
  * "//what He promised//" - when He sees the rainbow, God will also remember his promise not to destroy the world again by a flood
