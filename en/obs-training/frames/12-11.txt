{{:en:obs:obs-12-11.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

After the **[[:en:key-terms:israel|Israelites]]** all **made it safely to the other side**, **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** told **[[:en:key-terms:moses|Moses]]** to **stretch out his hand again**. When he obeyed, the **water fell on the [[:en:key-terms:egypt|Egyptian]] army** and **returned to its normal place**. **The whole Egyptian army** drowned.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **made it safely to the other side** – This could be translated as, “walked safely to the other side,” or “arrived safely on the other side,” or “walked to the other side and were safe from the Egyptians and the sea.”
  * **the other side** - This means, "the other side of the sea."
  * **stretch out his hand again** - This could be translated as, “lift his hand over the sea again,” or as a direct command, as in, “God told Moses, 'Stretch out your hand again.'”
  * **hand** – It may be more clear to say “arm” here since Moses would have extended his whole arm, including his hand.  
  * **water fell on the Egyptian army** - This could be translated as, “the water covered the Egyptian army.”
  * **returned to its normal place** - This could be translated as, “covered the place again where the path had been,” or “filled the whole sea again,” or "went back to where it was before God separated it."
  * **The whole Egyptian army** - This could be translated as, “everyone in Egypt's army.”
