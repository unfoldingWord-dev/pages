{{:en:obs:obs-03-03.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** told **[[:en:key-terms:noah|Noah]]** to make the boat about 140 meters long, 23 meters wide, and 13.5 meters high. It was to be made of wood and have three levels, many rooms, a roof, and a window. The boat would keep **[[:en:key-terms:noah|Noah]]**, his family, and two of every kind of animal safe during the flood.


=== Translation Notes: ===


Pay close attention to ...


  * "//the boat//" - also called the "ark." A boat that was big enough to carry eight people and two of every kind of animal for almost a year.
  * "//two of every kind of animal//" - a male and female of each kind of animal so they could multiply and fill the earth after the flood.
  * "//flood//" - the large flood that covered the whole world
