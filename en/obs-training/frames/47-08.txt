{{:en:obs:obs-47-08.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

They put **[[:en:key-terms:paul|Paul]]** and **[[:en:key-terms:silas|Silas]]** in the most secure part of the prison and even locked up their feet. Yet **in the middle of the night**, they were **singing songs of [[:en:key-terms:praise|praise]] to [[:en:key-terms:god|God]]**.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **in the middle of the night** – This could be translated as, “very late at night" or, "very early in the morning.” This was when it was completely dark outside, when people would normally be asleep.
  * **singing songs of praise to God** - This can also be translating as, “praising God by singing” or, "singing songs to praise God” or, “singing songs that gave praise to God.”
