They put **[[:en:key-terms:paul|Paul]]** and **[[:en:key-terms:silas|Silas]]** in the most secure part of the prison and even locked up their feet. Yet **in the middle of the night**, they were **singing songs of [[:en:key-terms:praise|praise]] to [[:en:key-terms:god|God]]**.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **in the middle of the night** – This could be translated as, “very late at night" or, "very early in the morning.” This was probably when it was completely dark outside, hours after people would normally be asleep.
  * **singing songs of praise to God** - This can also be translating as, “praising God by singing” or, "singing songs to praise God” or, “singing songs that gave praise to God.”
