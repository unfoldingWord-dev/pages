The jailer trembled as he came to **[[:en:key-terms:paul|Paul]]** and **[[:en:key-terms:silas|Silas]]** and asked, “What must I do **to be [[:en:key-terms:save|saved]]**?” **[[:en:key-terms:paul|Paul]]** answered, “**[[:en:key-terms:believe|Believe]] in [[:en:key-terms:jesus|Jesus]], the [[:en:key-terms:lord|Master]]**, and **you and your family will be [[:en:key-terms:save|saved]]**.” Then the jailer took Paul and Silas to his home and washed their wounds.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **to be saved** - This could also be translated as, “in order to be saved from my sins” or “so that God will save me from my sins.” The question refers to salvation from being punished by the God who caused the earthquake.
  * **Believe in Jesus, the Master** - This is addressed to both the jailer and his family, who all then believed and were baptized. Some languages may use a form to indicate that Paul is speaking to the group.
  * **you and your family will be saved** - The salvation referred to here is spiritual--salvation from sin.
