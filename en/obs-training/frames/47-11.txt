The jailer was terrified! He took **[[:en:key-terms:paul|Paul]]** and **[[:en:key-terms:silas|Silas]] home**, gave them some food, and washed their wounds. Then he said, “What must I do **to be [[:en:key-terms:save|saved]]**?”

Then the jailer asked Paul, “What must I do **to be [[:en:key-terms:save|saved]]**?” **[[:en:key-terms:paul|Paul]]** answered, “**[[:en:key-terms:believe|Believe]] in [[:en:key-terms:jesus|Jesus]], the [[:en:key-terms:lord|Master]]**, and **you and your family will be [[:en:key-terms:save|saved]]**.” 


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **to be saved** - This could also be translated as, "in order to be saved." The prisoners were secure, so he was no longer worried about being killed. This question therefore refers to salvation from his sins.
  * **Believe in Jesus, the Master** - This is addressed to both the jailer and his family, who all then believed and were baptized. Some languages may use a form to indicate that Paul is speaking to the group.
  * **you and your family will be saved** - The salvation referred to here is spiritual--salvation from sin.
