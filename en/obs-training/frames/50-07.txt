“The workers responded, ‘Should we pull out the weeds?’ The **[[:en:key-terms:lord|master]]** said, ‘No. If you do that, **you will pull out some of the wheat as well**. Wait until **the [[:en:key-terms:harvest|harvest]]** and then gather the weeds into piles to be burned, but bring the wheat **into my barn**.’”


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **you will pull out some of the wheat as well** - That is, "you will accidentally pull out some of the wheat also." It would be too difficult to distinguish young wheat from the weeds.
  * **the harvest** - That is, "the harvest time" when the wheat would be mature.
  * **into my barn** - This refers to the place where the good harvest was saved and stored.
