====== Jacob Meets Esau [07-09] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-07-09.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

**[[:en:key-terms:jacob|Jacob]]** was very afraid because he thought **[[:en:key-terms:esau|Esau]]** still wanted to kill him. So he sent **[[:en:key-terms:esau|Esau]]** many herds of animals as a gift. The **[[:en:key-terms:servant|servants]]** who brought the animals said to **[[:en:key-terms:esau|Esau]]**, “**These animals are a gift from your [[:en:key-terms:servant|servant]]**, **[[:en:key-terms:jacob|Jacob]]**. He is coming soon.”


===== Translation Notes: =====


   * **These animals are a gift from your servant Jacob** - This could also be translated as, “Your servant Jacob is giving you these animals.” 
  * **your servant, Jacob** - Jacob was not actually Esau's servant. But Jacob told his servants to say this because he wanted to show Esau that he was coming to him humbly and respectfully, so that Esau would no longer be angry with him.
