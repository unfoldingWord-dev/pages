The woman saw that the fruit was beautiful and looked delicious. She also wanted to be **[[:en:key-terms:wise|wise]]**, so she picked some of the fruit and ate it. Then she turned and gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it, too.


=== Translation Notes: ===


Pay close attention to â€¦


    * "//gave some to her husband//" - it was the woman, rather than the snake, who tempted the man to eat the fruit
    * "//who was with her//" - indicates that the man was present when the woman made the decision to eat the fruit. He did not arrive after at a later time.
    * "//he ate it//" - the man made his own decision to eat the fruit
