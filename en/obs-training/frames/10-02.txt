====== Pharaoh Refused to Obey [10-02] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-10-02.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

**[[:en:key-terms:pharaoh|Pharaoh]]** kept refusing to let **the people** go, so **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** sent **ten plagues** on **[[:en:key-terms:egypt|Egypt]]**. (A plague is a terrible disaster.) Through these plagues, **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** showed **[[:en:key-terms:pharaoh|Pharaoh]]** that He is more powerful than **[[:en:key-terms:pharaoh|Pharaoh]]** and **all of [[:en:key-terms:egypt|Egypt’s]] gods**.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **the people** - This refers to the people of Israel, also called, “the Israelites.”
  * **ten plagues** - A plague is something very bad or terrible that happens to someone or something. A plague usually refers to something that affects many people or happens over a large geographic area. Another word for "plague" would be "disaster."
  * **all of Egypt's gods** - It may be more clear to say, “all the gods that the Egyptian people worshiped.” The people of Egypt worshiped many different false gods. These false gods were either spirit beings that the God of Israel created, or they did not actually exist.
