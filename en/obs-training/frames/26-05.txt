Then **[[:en:key-terms:jesus|Jesus]]** said, “**I tell you the [[:en:key-terms:true|truth]]**, **no [[:en:key-terms:prophet|prophet]] is accepted in his own hometown**. When the prophet **[[:en:key-terms:elijah|Elijah]]** was alive there were many widows in **[[:en:key-terms:israel|Israel]]**. But when it did not rain for three and a half years, **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** did not send Elijah to help a widow from Israel but a widow from a different nation.”
