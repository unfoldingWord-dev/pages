Then **[[:en:key-terms:jesus|Jesus]]** said, “It is **[[:en:key-terms:true|true]]** that **no [[:en:key-terms:prophet|prophet]] is accepted in his own hometown**. **When the prophet [[:en:key-terms:elijah|Elijah]] was alive** there were many widows in **[[:en:key-terms:israel|Israel]]**. But when it did not rain for three and a half years, **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** did not send Elijah to help a widow from Israel, but rather to a widow from a different nation.”


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **no prophet is accepted in his hometown** - This phrase means, "people do not recognize the authority of a prophet that has grown up among them." 
  * **When the prophet Elijah was alive** – Another way to say this would be, “Long ago, when God's great prophet Elijah was alive.”
