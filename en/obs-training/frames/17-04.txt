**[[:en:key-terms:saul|Saul]]** became jealous of the people's love for **[[:en:key-terms:david|David]]**. Saul tried many times to kill him, so David hid from Saul. One day Saul was looking for David so he could kill him. Saul went into the same cave **where David was hiding** but did not see him. David was now very close to Saul and could have killed him, but he did not. Instead, David cut off a piece of Saul's clothes **to prove to Saul** that he would not kill him to become **[[:en:key-terms:king|king]]**.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **where David was hiding** - It might be necessary to say, "where David was hiding from Saul."
  * **to prove to Saul** - That is, “to convince Saul” or “to show Saul.”
