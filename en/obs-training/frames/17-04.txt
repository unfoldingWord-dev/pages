====== Saul Chased David [17-04] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-17-04.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

David went on to win many victories over Israel's enemies, for which the people praised him. That made **[[:en:key-terms:saul|Saul]]** jealous of **[[:en:key-terms:david|David]]**. Saul tried many times to kill him, so David hid from Saul. One day Saul was looking for David so he could kill him. Saul went into the same cave **where David was hiding** but did not see him. Instead of killing Saul, **David cut off a piece of his clothes** **to prove to Saul that he would not kill him** to become **[[:en:key-terms:king|king]]**.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **where David was hiding** - It might be necessary to say "where David was hiding from Saul."
  * **David cut off a piece of his clothes** - It might be necessary to say "David cut off a piece of Saul's clothes."
  * **to prove to Saul that he would not kill him** - That is, David demonstrated that he was close enough to Saul to kill him, but did not do it.
