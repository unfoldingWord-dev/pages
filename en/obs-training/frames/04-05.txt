So **[[:en:key-terms:abram|Abram]]** **[[:en:key-terms:obey|obeyed]]** **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]**. **He took** his wife, **[[:en:key-terms:sarah|Sarai]]**, their possessions, and all his **[[:en:key-terms: servant| servants]]** and went to the land **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]] showed him**, the **land of [[:en:key-terms:canaan|Canaan]]**.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **He took** – Some languages would say “He brought” here. Others would use two different verbs here, such as “he caused his wife to come with him” and “he brought along all of their servants and possessions.”
  * **God showed him** - Somehow God made it clear to Abram where he was to go. The text doesn't tell how God showed him. 
  * **land of Canaan** - The name of this land was “Canaan”. This could be translated, “the land called Canaan.” This is the land in the Middle East from the valley of the Jordan River going west to the Mediterranean Sea. Today the countries and territories in that land are Israel, Lebanon, part of Jordan, part of Syria, and Palestine.
