So **[[:en:key-terms:abram|Abram]]** **[[:en:key-terms:obey|obeyed]]**. **He took** his wife, **[[:en:key-terms:sarah|Sarai]]**, and **all his servants and herds** of animals and went to the land **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]] showed him**, the **land of [[:en:key-terms:canaan|Canaan]]**.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **He took** – Some languages would say “He brought” here. Others would use two different verbs here, such as “he caused his wife and nephew to come with him” and “he drove his animals along with him.”
  * **all his servants and herds** - Abram had become very wealthy in his own land, which made obeying God and leaving that land a risk for him
  * **God showed him** - Abram went to a country that he did not know only because God directed him there.
  * **land of Canaan** - The name of this land was “Canaan”. This could be translated, “the land called Canaan.”
