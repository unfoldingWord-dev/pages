“Still other seeds fell among thorn bushes. Those seeds began to grow, but **the thorns** **choked them out**. So the plants that grew from the seeds in the **thorny ground** did not produce any grain.”


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * (Jesus continues the story.)
  * **the thorns** – That is, “the thorn plants” or, “the thorn bushes.”
  * **choked them out** - This can also be translated as, “overshadowed them” or, “crowded them out.”
  * **thorny ground** - That is, "ground that was covered with thorny bushes."
