  * **it is written** – That is, “the prophets of long ago wrote.” 
  * **He will command** - That is, “God will command” or, "Yahweh will command." 
  * ** so your foot does not hit the ground** - This means, “so that you will not be hurt at all; not even your foot will hit the ground.” It could also be translated as, “so that even your foot will not strike the ground; you will not be injured at all.”
