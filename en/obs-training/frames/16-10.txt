**32,000 [[:en:key-terms:israel|Israelite]] soldiers came to [[:en:key-terms:gideon|Gideon]]**, but **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** told him this was **too many**. So Gideon sent home 22,000 who were too scared to fight. God told Gideon that he still had too many men. So Gideon sent all of them home **except for 300 soldiers**.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **32,000 Israelite soldiers came to Gideon** - Some languages might need to start this story with, “Gideon called the Israelites to come fight against the Midianites.” 
  * **too many** - That is, there were so many soldiers that they might think they would the battle on their own strength instead of relying on God's help.
  * **too scared to fight** - Although these men came to join the army, but they were actually very fearful that they would be injured or killed.
  * **except for 300 soldiers** - This sentence could be translated as, “So Gideon allowed only 300 men to stay, and the rest of the men went home.”
