Then **[[:en:key-terms:jesus|Jesus]]** cried out, “It is finished! **[[:en:key-terms:god-father|Father]]**, I give my **[[:en:key-terms:spirit|spirit]]** **into your hands**.” Then he bowed his head and **gave up his spirit**. When he **[[:en:key-terms:death|died]]**, there was an earthquake and the **large curtain** in the **[[:en:key-terms:temple|Temple]]** that separated the presence of **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** from the people was torn in two, from the top to the bottom.


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **It is finished!** - This exclamation means that the work of salvation is complete. However, since it is the exact phrase that Jesus spoke, it would be best to translate it literally if it will be understood in your language.
  * **into your hands** - That is, "into your care."
  * **gave up his spirit** - Jesus did not die in the typical way. He actively released his spirit from his body. Translate this phrase in such a way that is expresses that he decided when the moment of his death should happen.
  * **large curtain** - This curtain was very heavy, unlike a window curtain in a house. It was more like the heavy curtains in a theater. If your language has a word for that kind of curtain, it should be used here.
