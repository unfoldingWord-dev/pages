===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **two robbers**  - This could also be translated as, “two bandits.” This refers to criminals who used force or violence to steal things.
    * 
    * Do you have no fear of God? - The robber does not expect an answer to this question; it is a way that some languages use to make a strong statement. If your language does not use questions in this way, then translate this as, "You should fear God!"
    * 
    * **We are guilty but this man is innocent**  – This could be translated as, “You and I have done evil things and deserve to die, but this man, Jesus, has done nothing wrong and does not deserve to die." Some languages have a special word for “we” that means it includes the person being spoken to.
    * **this man**  - This phrase refers to Jesus.
    * **Please remember me**  - That is, “Please accept me” or, "Please welcome me" or, "Please allow me to be with you." This man was speaking humbly to Jesus. Some languages will need to put a word with Jesus name or use a special form of the verb to show the man's humility.
    * **in your kingdom**  – That is, “when you establish your kingdom” or, “when you are ruling as king.”
    * **Paradise**  - This is another name for "heaven."
