{{:en:obs:obs-13-08.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

**[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** gave the **[[:en:key-terms:israel|Israelites]] a detailed description** of a tent he wanted them to make. **It was called** the **[[:en:key-terms:tent-of-meeting|Tent of Meeting]]**, and it had two rooms, separated by a large curtain. **No one could enter the room behind the curtain except the [[:en:key-terms:priest-high|high priest]]**, because **God lived there**.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **a detailed description** - This could be translated as, “God described it in detail” or, “God told them exactly how He wanted them to make it.”
  * **It was called** - This could be translated as, “They called it” or, “Moses called it.” 
  * **No one could enter … except the high priest** - This could be translated as, “Only the high priest was allowed to go into the room behind the curtain. Other people were not allowed to go into it."
  * **the room behind the curtain** - This room was hidden by the curtain. Some languages would call this room, “the room in front of the curtain.”
  * **God lived there** - If this phrase would lead people to think that God was limited to living in the tent, here are some ways of translating it: “God was there” or, “God revealed Himself to humans there.”
