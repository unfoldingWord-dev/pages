===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **one day** - This phrase introduces an event that happened in the past, but does not state the specific time. Many languages have a similar way to begin telling a true story.
  * **turned to her** – That is, “turned around and looked at her.”
  * **In the name of Jesus** - That is, “by the authority of Jesus.” Because of Jesus' authority, Paul could command the demon to leave.
  * **come out of her** - That is, "leave her" or, "go away from her."
