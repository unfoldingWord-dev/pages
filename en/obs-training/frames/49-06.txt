**[[:en:key-terms:jesus|Jesus]]** taught that some people will **[[:en:key-terms:receive|receive]]** him and be **[[:en:key-terms:save|saved]]**, but **others will not**. He said that some people are like good soil. They receive the **[[:en:key-terms:good-news|good news]]** of Jesus and are saved. Other people are like the hard soil of a path, where the **seed of [[:en:key-terms:word-of-god|God's word]]** does not enter and does not produce any harvest. Those people reject the message about Jesus and will not enter into **[[:en:key-terms:kingdom-of-god|his kingdom]]**. 

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **others will not** - That is, "other people will not receive him and therefore will not be saved."
  * **seed of God's word** - This can be translated as, "seed, which can be compared to God's word." This phrase makes a comparison between seed and God's word. A seed that the hard soil rejects so that the seed cannot grow is like God's word that a person rejects and so it does not make any difference in that person's life. 
  * **spread by hand** - That is, “threw the seeds on the soil” or, “covered all of his crop soil with seeds.” This is the way that farmers in the ancient Middle East typically planted grain-bearing crops.
