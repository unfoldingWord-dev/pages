{{:en:obs:obs-37-02.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

After the two days had passed, **[[:en:key-terms:jesus|Jesus]]** said to his **[[:en:key-terms:disciple|disciples]]**, “Let’s go back to **Judea**.” “But **[[:en:key-terms:teacher|Teacher]]**,” the disciples answered, “Just a short time ago the people there wanted to kill you!” Jesus said, “Our friend **[[:en:key-terms:lazarus|Lazarus]]** **has fallen asleep, and I must wake him**.”


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Judea** - This refers to the southern section of Israel, which was settled by the tribe of Judah. Some languages will prefer to say, “the region of Judea.” 
  * **has fallen asleep, and I must wake him.** - Translate this phrase with the normal words for “asleep” and “wake” in your language. Although Jesus was using these words with a different meaning, the disciples did not understand that yet.
