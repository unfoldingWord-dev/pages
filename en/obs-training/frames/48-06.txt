====== The Great High Priest [48-06] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-48-06.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

Melchizedek was a priest who blessed Abraham. Like Melchizedek, Jesus is  a priest, but Jesus is the Great High Priest. Jesus offered only one sacrifice, himself. This was the only sacrifice needed to take away the sin of the whole world. Jesus took the punishment for every sin that anyone has ever committed.
