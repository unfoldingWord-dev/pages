Then **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** said, “Now that the human beings have become like us by knowing **[[:en:key-terms:good|good]]** and **[[:en:key-terms:evil|evil]]**, they must not be allowed to eat the fruit of the tree of **[[:en:key-terms:life|life]]** and live forever.” So **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** sent **[[:en:key-terms:adam|Adam]]** and **[[:en:key-terms:eve|Eve]]** away from the beautiful garden. **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** placed large, powerful **[[:en:key-terms:angel|angels]]** at the entrance to the garden to keep anyone from eating the fruit of the tree of life.

===== Translation Notes: =====



    * **like us by knowing good and evil** - When Adam and Eve disobeyed, they experienced evil. This knowledge of sin is then passed on to all of their descendents.
    * **fruit** - the specific kind of fruit is not revealed.
    * **tree of life** - a literal tree with fruit that could keep a person alive continually 
    * **live forever** - If Adam and Eve ate from the tree of life, they would remain alive in their sinful condition.
    * **garden** - 
    * **sent Adam and Eve away** - the tree of life grew only in the garden. God sent them out of the garden so they could not eat from it.
    * **angels at the entrance** - the angels acted as guards to prevent access to the garden
