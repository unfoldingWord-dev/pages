Then **God** said, “Now that the human beings have become like us by knowing **good** and **evil**, they must not be allowed to eat the fruit of the tree of life and live forever.” So **God** sent **Adam** and **Eve** away from the beautiful garden. **God** placed large, powerful **angels** at the entrance to the garden to keep anyone from eating the fruit of the tree of life.

    * "fruit" - the specific kind of fruit is not revealed.
    * "//tree of life//" - a literal tree with fruit that could keep a person alive continually 
    * "//live forever//" - If Adam and Eve ate from the tree of life, they would remain alive in their sinful condition.
    * "//garden//" - 
    * "//sent Adam and Eve away//" - the tree of life grew only in the garden. God sent them out of the garden so they could not eat from it.
    * "//angels at the entrance//" - the angels acted as guards to prevent access to the garden
