====== Rebekah Was Childless [06-04] ======


{{:en:obs:obs-06-04.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


After a long time, **[[:en:key-terms:abraham|Abraham]]** died and all of **the [[:en:key-terms:promise|promises]] that [[:en:key-terms:god|God]] had made to him in the [[:en:key-terms:covenant|covenant]] were passed on** to **[[:en:key-terms:isaac|Isaac]]**. God had promised that Isaac would have **countless [[:en:key-terms:descendant|descendants]]**, but Isaac's wife, **[[:en:key-terms:rebekah|Rebekah]]**, could not have children. 



===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **the promises ... were passed on** - The promises of the covenant that God made with Abraham were not for him only, but also for his descendents.
  * **countless descendants** - The word “countless” means there would be so many descendants that people would not be able to count them. This could also be translated as, “many.”
