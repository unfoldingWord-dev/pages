**[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** made man and woman in His own image, and He saw that it was very **[[:en:key-terms:good|good]]**. He **[[:en:key-terms:bless|blessed]]**  them and told them, "Have many children and grandchildren and fill the earth!" This all happened on the sixth day of creation.


===== Emphasis: =====


As His final act of creation, God made the man and the woman as a special kind of creature. He made them in His own image, sharing many of His characteristics that the animals did not have. God told them to multiply and fill the earth with people. God's creation was now complete and very good! The sixth day of creation ended with everything done according to God's perfect plan and purpose.


===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **God made** - God formed the man and the woman in a very personal way.
    * **in His own image** - sharing similar traits, qualities, or appearance, but not necessarily equal in all respects
    * "//have many//" - literally to "be fruitful"
    * "//day//" - a literal 24-hour period
