**[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** made man and woman in His own image, and He saw that it was very **[[:en:key-terms:good|good]]**. He **[[:en:key-terms:bless|blessed]]**  them and told them, "Have many children and grandchildren and fill the earth!" This all happened on the sixth day of creation.


===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **[[:en:obs-training/sandbox/chrislane/god-info|God]] made** - God formed the man and the woman in a very personal way.
    * **in His own image** - sharing similar traits, qualities, or appearance, but not necessarily equal in all respects
    * **it was very [[:en:obs-training/sandbox/chrislane/good-info|good]]** - More intense than the "it was good" statements on previous days. "Very good" refers to all of creation, not just the man and the woman. Everything was exactly as God intended it to be.
    * **the sixth day of creation** - God progressively created everything that exists in six days, culminating with the man and the woman. Everything was done in a precise order according to His plan and purpose.
