Then **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** asked, “**Who told you that you were naked?** Did you eat the fruit I told you not to eat?” The man answered, “You gave me this woman, and **she gave me the fruit**.” Then **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** asked the woman, “What have you done?” The woman replied, “**The snake tricked me**.”

===== Translation Notes: =====



    * **Who told you that you were naked?** - Being naked was not a sin. God created them that way. Their knowledge of their nakedness was the problem. Their shame showed that they had sinned.
    * **she gave me the fruit** - The man blamed the woman rather than confessing his disobedience. 
    * **The snake tricked me** - The woman blamed the snake rather than confessing her disobedience.
