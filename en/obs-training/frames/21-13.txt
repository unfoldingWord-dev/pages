===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **having no sin** - This might be translated as, "he never sinned" or, "he was not guilty of any sin."
  * **receive the punishment** - That is, to "take onto himself" or, "suffer the punishment" intended for other people or, to "be punished in the place of" others. 
  * **it was God's will** - This phrase does not mean that God was happy about punishing the Messiah. Rather, it means that God considered it a good idea, and an acceptable solution to the problem of sin.
  * **to crush** - That is, "to damage completely," “to kill” or, “to completely destroy.”
