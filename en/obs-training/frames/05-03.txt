“I am **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** Almighty. I will make a **[[:en:key-terms:covenant|covenant]]** with you.” Then **[[:en:key-terms:abraham|Abram]]** bowed to the ground. God said, “You will be the **father of many nations**. I will give you and your **[[:en:key-terms:descendant|descendants]]** the land of **[[:en:key-terms:canaan|Canaan]]** as their possession and **I will be their God** forever. You must **[[:en:key-terms:circumcise|circumcise]]** **every male in your family**.”
 

===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **father of many nations** - Abram would have many descendants, and they would have their own lands and rule themselves. They and others would remember that Abram was their ancestor and would honor him. 
  * **I will be their God** - Another way to say this is, "I will be the God that they will worship."
  * **every male in your family** - This could be translated as, “every boy and man in your family.” This included Abram's servants and his descendants.
