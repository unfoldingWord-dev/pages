==== 03-08. Safe from the Flood ====

{{:en:obs:obs-03-08.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Everything that lived on the dry land **[[:en:key-terms:die|died]]**, except the people and animals who were in the boat. The boat floated on the water and everything inside the boat was kept safe.


=== Translation Notes: ===


Pay close attention to ...


  * "//Everything that lived on the dry land//" - all of the people and animals that lived on land died. Only the fish and creatures in the sea survived.
  * "//the boat//" - the ark with Noah's family and the animals
  * "//kept safe//" - the ark floated on the water and protected those inside from drowning
