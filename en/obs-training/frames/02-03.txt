====== Do Not Touch [02-03] ======


{{:en:obs:obs-02-03.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


The woman answered, “**[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** told us we could eat the **fruit** of any tree except from the **tree of the knowledge of [[:en:key-terms:good|good]] and [[:en:key-terms:evil|evil]]**. **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** told us, ‘If you eat that fruit or even touch it, **you will [[:en:key-terms:death|die]]**.’”


===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **fruit** - We don't know what kind of fruit this was. We only know that it grew on this tree.  If possible it is best to use a general word for fruit here, and not a word for a specific kind of fruit. 
    * **tree of the knowledge of [[:en:key-terms:good|good]] and [[:en:key-terms:evil|evil]]** - The woman correctly understood that they were not allowed to eat from this one tree that would enable them to understand evil as well as good.
    * **you will [[:en:key-terms:death|die]]** - Use your ordinary word for death, for a person's physical life to end. Don't avoid the term just because the thought of death sounds too harsh.
