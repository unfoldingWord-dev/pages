The woman answered, “**[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** told us we could eat the fruit of any tree except from the tree of the knowledge of **[[:en:key-terms:good|good]]** and **[[:en:key-terms:evil|evil]]**. **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** told us, ‘If you eat that fruit or even touch it, you will **[[:en:key-terms:death|die]]**.’”

===== Translation Notes: =====



    * **fruit** - we don't know what kind of fruit this was. We only know that it grew on the trees.
    * **tree of the knowledge of good and evil** - the woman correctly understood that they were not allowed to eat from this one tree that would enable them to understand evil as well as good.
    * **or even touch** - the woman incorrectly added this additional restriction to God' command. God did not tell them not to touch the fruit.
