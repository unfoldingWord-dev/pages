The woman answered, “**God** told us we could eat the fruit of any tree except from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. **God** told us, ‘If you eat that fruit or even touch it, you will **die**.’”

=== Key Terms: ===


    * **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** - Almighty, creator, sinless and perfect
    * **[[:en:key-terms:good|good]]** - in agreement with God's character and purposes, to an extra measure
    * **[[:en:key-terms:evil|evil]]** - anything that is opposed to God's character and purposes
    * **[[:en:key-terms:die|die]]** - to die is to be separated from God and from life on this earth


=== Translation Notes: ===


Pay close attention to …


    * "//fruit//" - we don't know what kind of fruit this was. We only know that it grew on the trees.
    * "//tree of the knowledge of good and evil//" - the woman correctly understood that they were not allowed to eat from this one tree that would enable them to understand evil as well as good.
    * "//or even touch//" - the woman incorrectly added this additional restriction to God' command. God did not tell them not to touch the fruit.
