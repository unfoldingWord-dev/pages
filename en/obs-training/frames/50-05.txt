====== The Enemy [50-05] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-50-05.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

**[[:en:key-terms:jesus|Jesus]]** told his **[[:en:key-terms:disciple|disciples]]** a story to explain what will happen to people when the world ends. He said, “A man planted **[[:en:key-terms:good|good]] seed** in his field. While he was sleeping, his enemy came and planted **weed seeds** along with the **wheat**, and then he went away.”


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **good seed** – This seed was wheat grain. If this type of seed is not known in your language area, it is best to use a general term for “seed.” If there is no general term, it may be necessary to choose a type of grain seed that is known and say, for example, “good seed like rice.”
  * **weed seeds** - The weed seeds that were planted would grow up as tall grass but could not be eaten. They were useless.
  * **wheat** – That is, “wheat seeds.” Wheat is a kind of grain that grows like a tall grass. It has seeds that people use for food.
