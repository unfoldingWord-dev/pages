===== Translation Notes: =====



    * **crafty snake** - The snake was sly and sneaky, but apparently the woman was not yet afraid of it. Satan apparently spoke through the snake to temp the woman.
    * **garden** - a special collection of trees and plants that God prepared for Adam and Eve
    * **Did God really tell you …** - the snake questions whether God actually said not to eat from the trees. He wanted to create doubt in the woman's mind.
    * **fruit of the trees** - all of the various types of fruit from the different trees in the garden
