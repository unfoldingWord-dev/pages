But there was a **crafty snake** in the garden. He asked the woman, “**Did [[:en:key-terms:god|God]] really tell you** not to eat the **fruit from the trees** in the garden?”


===== Translation Notes: =====



    * **crafty** - Clever and sly, with the intent to deceive. 
    * **snake** - An elongated, legless land creature that now moves by slithering. Although later on in the story it is revealed that the snake is Satan, this should not be said here in this frame. 
    * **Did God really tell you …** - The snake asked Eve whether God actually said not to eat from any of the trees in the garden. He really wanted to create doubt in the woman's mind. But he did it by pretending that he didn't know what God had said. 
    * **fruit of the trees** - All of the various types of fruit from each of the different trees in the garden.
