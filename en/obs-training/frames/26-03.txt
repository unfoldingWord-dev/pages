“**[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** has given me his [[:en:key-terms:holy-spirit|Spirit]] so that I can **proclaim [[:en:key-terms:good-news|good news]] to the poor**, **freedom to captives**, **recovery of sight for the blind**, and **release to the oppressed**. This is **the year of the [[:en:key-terms:lord|Lord's]] favor**.”


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **proclaim good news to the poor** - That is, “to tell poor people, needy people, and, ultimately, those who are dependent upon God to sustain them the good message that God will help them."
  * **freedom to captives** - That is, “to tell people who are wrongfully in prison that they will be released.” 
  * **recovery of sight for the blind** - This could be translated as, “that those who are blind will receive sight" or, "those who are blind to spiritual truth will be able to see/understand it."
  * **release to the oppressed** - That is, “freedom for those who are repressed in life, especially those who are spiritually repressed by sin.”
  * **the year of the Lord's favor** - This may be translated as, "the time when the Lord will be merciful to us" or, "the time when the Lord will be very gracious to us."
