====== David Murdered Uriah [17-12] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-17-12.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

**[[:en:key-terms:bathsheba|Bathsheba's]]** husband, **[[:en:key-terms:uriah|Uriah]]**, was one of **[[:en:key-terms:david|David's]]** best soldiers. David called Uriah back from the battle and told him to go **be with his wife**. But Uriah refused to go home while the rest of the soldiers were in battle. So David sent Uriah back to the battle and told the general to place him **where the enemy was strongest** so that he would be killed.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **be with his wife** - David wanted Uriah to have time to have sexual relations with Bathsheba, and as a result, believe that she was pregnant by him, rather than by David.
  * **where the enemy was strongest** - That is, the location where the enemy was the most dangerous to Uriah.
