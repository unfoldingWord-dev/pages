“Do not make **[[:en:key-terms:idol|idols]]** or **[[:en:key-terms:worship|worship]]** them, **for I, [[:en:key-terms:yahweh|Yahweh]], am a jealous [[:en:key-terms:god|God]]**. **Do not use my name in a disrespectful way**. Remember to **keep the [[:en:key-terms:sabbath|Sabbath]] day [[:en:key-terms:holy|holy]]**. Do all your work in six days, for the **seventh day** is a **day of rest** to remember me.”


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **Do not make idols or worship them** - This means, “Do not make idols and do not worship them.”
  * **for** – This could be translated as, “because” or “since.”
  * **I…am a jealous God** - This could be translated as, “I…will be angry if you worship or honor anything besides Me.” God strongly desires that his people love, serve, and obey Him more than anything or anyone else. He must be the only master of their lives. 
  * **Do not use my name in a disrespectful way** - This could be translated as, “Do not talk about me in a way that does not show respect and honor” or "Talk about me in a way that gives me proper respect and honor."
  * **keep the Sabbath day holy** - explanation
  * **seventh day** - explanation
  * **day of rest** - explanation
