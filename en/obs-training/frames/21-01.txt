====== Messiah Will Defeat Satan [21-01] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-21-01.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

From the very beginning, God had a plan to send the Messiah. The first promise of the coming Messiah came to Adam and Eve. God promised that a descendant of Eve would be born who would crush the snakeâ€™s head. The snake who deceived Eve is Satan. The promise means the coming Messiah would defeat Satan completely.
