Then the walls around **[[:en:key-terms:jericho|Jericho]]** fell down! The **[[:en:key-terms:israel|Israelites]]** destroyed everything in the city as **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** had commanded. **[[:en:key-terms:rahab|Rahab]]** and her family were the only people in the city that they did not kill. They **became part of** the Israelites. When the other people living in **[[:en:key-terms:canaan|Canaan]]** heard that the Israelites had destroyed Jericho, they were terrified that the Israelites would attack them also.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **became part of** - This can be translated as, “who then joined the Israelite community” or, “who then became members of the nation of Israel.”
