After they had wandered in the wilderness for forty years, all the people who had rebelled against God were dead. God led the Israelites to the edge of the Promised Land again. Moses was now very old, so he chose Joshua to help him lead the people. God promised Moses that one day He would raise up another prophet like Moses.
