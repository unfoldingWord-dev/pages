====== At the Promised Land [14-14] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-14-14.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

After the **[[:en:key-terms:israel|Israelites]]** had wandered in the wilderness for forty years, all of them  **who had **[[:en:key-terms:rebel|rebelled]]** against [[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** were dead. Then God led the people to the edge of the **[[:en:key-terms:promised-land|Promised Land]]** again. **[[:en:key-terms:moses|Moses]]** was now very old, so God chose **[[:en:key-terms:joshua|Joshua]]** to help him lead the people. God also **[[:en:key-terms:promise|promised]]** Moses that **one day** He would **raise up another [[:en:key-terms:prophet|prophet]] like Moses**.


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **who had rebelled against God** - This could be translated, "who had refused to obey God when he told them to go into the Promised Land." 
  * **one day** - This means, "some time in the future."
  * **raise up another prophet like Moses** - This could be translated as, “send another prophet like Moses” or, “cause another man to become a prophet like Moses.”  Like Moses, this man would be an Israelite, he would speak God's words to the people, and he would lead the people.
