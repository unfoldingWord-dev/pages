====== Go Home [32-11] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-32-11.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

But **[[:en:key-terms:jesus|Jesus]]** said to him, “**Go home** and tell your friends and family **how much [[:en:key-terms:god|God]] has done for you** and how **he has had [[:en:key-terms:mercy|mercy]] on you**.”


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Go home** – This could be translated as, “No, you should go back home.” Make sure that this command does not sound rude. Some languages will need to say, “No…” to make it clear that Jesus is not granting his request.
  * **how much God has done for you** - This can be translated as, “about what God has done for you” or, “about all God has done for you.” 
  * **he has had mercy on you** - This can be translated as “how he has shown mercy to you” or, “that he has been merciful to you.”
