Then **[[:en:key-terms:jesus|Jesus]]** took a cup and said, “**Drink this.** **It is my [[:en:key-terms:blood|blood]]** of the **[[:en:key-terms:covenant-new|New Covenant]]** **shed for the [[:en:key-terms:forgive|forgiveness]] of [[:en:key-terms:sin|sins]]**. Do this to remember me as often as you drink it.” In this way, Jesus said that **his blood would be poured** out to forgive their sins.


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Drink this.** - That is, "Drink the contents of the cup." Tradition holds that the cup at the Passover mean contained wine. Some traditions substitute grape juice of other liquids as available. For this reason, it is probably best to simply refer to the cup in the translation, rather than to the contents.
  * **It is my blood** - As with the bread, this is generally understood to mean, “The contents of this cup represent my blood, which will be poured out for your sake.” However, some Christian traditions believe the contents of the cup somehow becomes literally or mystically connected to Jesus. Translate this phrase as literally as possible to allow for both meanings if it will be understandable in your language.
  * **shed for the forgiveness of sins** - The blood of Jesus is more powerful than the blood of the Passover lamb. Instead of temporarily covering sin, the blood of Jesus that is shed during his death actually takes away sin and provides forgiveness.
  * **his blood would be poured ** - The blood of Jesus was poured out in the same way was the blood of the Old Testament sacrifices.
