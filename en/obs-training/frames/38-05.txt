Then **[[:en:key-terms:jesus|Jesus]]** picked up a cup and said, “**Drink this.** **It is my [[:en:key-terms:blood|blood]] of the [[:en:key-terms:covenant-new|New Covenant]]** **shed for the [[:en:key-terms:forgive|forgiveness]] of [[:en:key-terms:sin|sins]]**. Do this to **remember** me every time you drink it.” In this way, Jesus said that his blood would be **poured out** **to forgive their sins**.


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **a cup** – That is, “a cup of wine” or “a cup full of a drink made from grapes.” 
  * **Drink this** - That is, “Drink what is in this cup” or, “Drink from this cup.” The drink in the cup was made from grapes.
  * **It is my blood** - Some Christian traditions understand this to mean, “The contents of this cup represent my blood, which will be poured out for you.” Other Christian traditions believe that the contents of the cup somehow, literally and supernaturally, take on the same substance as Jesus' blood. If possible, translate this phrase in a way that will allow for both understandings. 
  * **blood of the New Covenant** – This could be translated as, “blood that makes the New Covenant possible” or, “blood, which is what the New Covenant is based on.” 
  * **shed for the forgiveness of sins** - That is, “shed so that people can be completely forgiven for all of their sins.” Speaking of blood being "shed" or, "poured out" was a way of talking about being killed. Jesus meant that he would be killed so that God could forgive our sins. 
  * **remember** - That is, “celebrate” or, “commemorate.” It could also be translated as, “especially focus on.” Make sure the translation of this does not sound like they will forget about it before then. 
  * **poured out** - This should be translated with a phrase that describes blood that, “ran out” or, “gushed from” a body. The blood of Jesus came out of his body in the same way as the blood poured out of the bodies of animals that were sacrificed under the old covenant. 
  * **to forgive their sins** – This could be translated as, “so that their sins would be forgiven” or, “so that God would forgive their sins.”
