**[[:en:key-terms:peter|Peter]]** said to **[[:en:key-terms:jesus|Jesus]]**, “We have **left everything** and followed you. **What will be our reward?**”


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **left everything** - That is, “left everything behind” or, “given up everything we owned.”
  * **What will be our reward?** - Another way to say this is, “What reward will we receive” or, “How will we be rewarded?” or, “What will God give us as a reward?” It may also be necessary to add, "because we have done this?”
