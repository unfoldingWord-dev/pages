===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **They placed people at** - That is, “They sent people to wait at.” They were waiting there to kill Paul as soon as he walked through the gates to go outside of the city. 
  * **the city gates** - The gates were the only normal way into or out of the walled cities.
  * **lowered him over the city wall in a basket** - Another way to say this would be, “helped him get into a large basket and lowered the basket with him in it over the city wall.” 
  * **ran away from** – That is, “escaped from” or, “fled from.” He didn't literally run the whole way. 
  * **Damascus** - See note on **[[:en:obs-training:frames:46-01|[46-01]]]**.
