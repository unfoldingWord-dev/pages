{{:en:obs:obs-38-08.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

After the meal, **[[:en:key-terms:jesus|Jesus]]** and his **[[:en:key-terms:disciple|disciples]]** walked to the **Mount of Olives**. Jesus said, “All of you will all abandon me tonight. **It is written**, ‘**I will strike the [[:en:key-terms:shepherd|shepherd]]** and **all the [[:en:key-terms:sheep|sheep]] will be scattered**.’”


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Mount of Olives** - A hill covered with olive trees just outside the walls of the city of Jerusalem.
  * **It is written** - That is, "it is written in the Old Testament scriptures."
  * **I will strike the shepherd** - This prophesy refers to the death of Jesus, but it should be translated literally since it is a quotation from the Old Testament.
  * **all the sheep will be scattered** - This prophesy refers to the scattering of the disciples, but it should be translated literally since it is a quotation from the Old Testament.
