====== The Beginning [01-01] ======


{{:en:obs:obs-01-01.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


This is how the beginning of everything happened. **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** created the heavens and the earth and everything in them in six days. At first, the earth was dark and empty, and nothing had been formed in it; there was only water covering it. But **[[:en:key-terms:holy-spirit|God's Spirit]]** was moving over the water.


===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **the beginning**  - that is, "the beginning of all things," before anything existed except God
    * **created**  - here used in the sense of making something out of nothing
    * **heavens** - Everything that God created above the earth, including the sun, moon and far-off stars.
    * **earth** - This refers to the planet or world that people live on. compare this to the use of “earth” in the frame about “Dry Land”. Some languages will have two different words for these terms. 
    * **six days**  - Days in the Old Testament started and ended at sundown--darkness followed by light.
    * **at first** - Another way to say this would be, “Before God created anything on the earth, it was….” 
    * **nothing had been formed**  - There were no distinguishing features–just water covering everything.
    * **dark**  - Having no light; God had not yet created light.
    * **empty**  - God had not yet created anything except for the bare earth covered by water.
    * **[[:en:key-terms:holy-spirit|God's Spirit]]**  - The Spirit of God, sometimes called the Holy Spirit, was present in the beginning, moving freely over the earth in order to create all that He had planned to do.
