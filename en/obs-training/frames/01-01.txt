====== The Beginning [01-01] ======


{{:en:obs:obs-01-01.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


This is how the beginning of everything happened. **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** created the universe and everything in it in six days. At first, the earth was dark and empty, and nothing had been formed in it. But **[[:en:key-terms:holy-spirit|God's Spirit]]** was there over the water.


===== Emphasis: =====


God is eternal, existing before anything else. He displayed His power by making everything in only six days. The first step was to create the bare earth completely covered with water. There was not yet any dry land or any living thing. But God's Spirit was there participating in the work of creation.


===== Translation Notes: =====

God is eternal, existing before anything else. He displayed His power by making everything in only six days. 

    * **the beginning**  - that is, "the beginning of all things," before anything existed except God
    * **created**  - here used in the sense of making something out of nothing
    * **universe** - Everything that exists, including the sun, moon and far-off stars, as well as everything on the earth.
    * **six days**  - Days in the Old Testament started and ended at sundown--darkness followed by light.
    * **at first** - Another way to say this would be, “Before God created anything on the earth, it was….” 
    * **nothing had been formed**  - There were no distinguishing features–just water covering everything.
    * **dark**  - Having no light; God had not yet created light.
    * **empty**  - God had not yet created anything except for the bare earth covered by water.
    * **[[:en:obs-training/sandbox/chrislane/god-s_spirit|God's Spirit]] was there**  - The Spirit of God, sometimes called the Holy Spirit, was present in the beginning, moving freely over the earth in order to create all that He had planned to do.
    * **water** - Water completely covered the empty earth.
