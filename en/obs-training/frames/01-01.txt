{{:en:obs:obs-01-01.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


This is how **the beginning ** of everything happened. **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]] created** the **universe** and everything in it in six days. After God created the earth it was **dark ** and **empty**, and **nothing had been formed ** in it. But **[[:en:key-terms:holy-spirit|God's Spirit]]** was there over the water.


===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **the beginning**  - That is, "the beginning of all things," before anything existed except God.
    * **created**  - Here used in the sense of making something out of nothing.
    * **universe** - Includes everything that God created on the earth and in the heavens, both visible and invisible things. 
    * **dark**  - It was completely dark. There was no light at all, since God had not yet created light.
    * **empty**  - God had not yet created anything except for the bare earth covered by water.
    * **nothing had been formed**- There were no distinguishing featuresâ€“just water covering everything.
    * **[[:en:key-terms:holy-spirit|God's Spirit]]**- The Spirit of God, sometimes called the Holy Spirit, was present in the beginning, moving freely over the earth in order to create all that He had planned to do.
