(CL: might it be helpful to asterisk or footnote the terms in the story that appear in this "Translation Notes" section?)


Pay close attention to …


    * "//the beginning//" - refers to "the beginning of all things", or "before everything else" (LS: moved from KT) (CL: I like the 1st definition, but think the second possibly begs more questions than it answers, though I do see how it could clarify when nothing but God existed)
    * "//day//" - refers to a literal 24-hour period, which began at sundown and ended at sundown the next day (LS: moved from KT)
    * "//nothing had been formed//" - there were no distinguishing features–just water covering everything (LS: moved from KT) (CL: In addition to emptiness, term denotes confusion/chaos, inferring that the Lord formed and ordered our world. Maybe this would add too much confusion, though. Ironic.)
    * note the discourse…
    * note the grammatical features…
