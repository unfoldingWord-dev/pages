====== The Beginning [01-01] ======


{{:en:obs:obs-01-01.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


This is how the beginning of everything happened. **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** created the universe and everything in it in six days. At first, the earth was dark and empty, and nothing had been formed in it. But **[[:en:key-terms:holy-spirit|God's Spirit]]** was there over the water.


===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **the beginning**  - that is, "the beginning of all things," before anything existed except God
    * **created**  - here used in the sense of making something out of nothing
    * **universe** - Everything that God created, including the sun, moon and far-off stars, as well as everything on the earth.
    * **six days**  - Days in the Old Testament started and ended at sundown--darkness followed by light.
    * **at first** - Another way to say this would be, “Before God created anything on the earth, it was….” 
    * **nothing had been formed**  - There were no distinguishing features–just water covering everything.
    * **dark**  - Having no light; God had not yet created light.
    * **empty**  - God had not yet created anything except for the bare earth covered by water.
    * **[[:en:obs-training/sandbox/chrislane/god-s_spirit|God's Spirit]] was there**  - The Spirit of God, sometimes called the Holy Spirit, was present in the beginning, moving freely over the earth in order to create all that He had planned to do.
    * **water** - Water completely covered the empty earth.
