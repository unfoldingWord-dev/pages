====== 01-01. The Beginning ======


{{:en:obs:obs-01-01.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


This is how the beginning of everything happened. **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** created the universe and everything in it in six days. At first, the earth was dark and empty, and nothing had been formed in it. But **[[:en:key-terms:holy-spirit|God's Spirit]]** was there over the water.

===== Emphasis: =====


God is eternal, existing before anything else. He displayed his power by making everything in only six days. The first step was to create the bare earth completely covered with water. There was not yet any dry land or any living thing. But God's Spirit was there participating in the work of creation.


===== Translation Notes: =====


    * "//the beginning//" - refers to "the beginning of all things", or "before everything else"
    * "//created//" - here used in the sense of making out of nothing
    * "//day//" - refers to a literal 24-hour period, which began at sundown and ended at sundown the next day
    * "//nothing had been formed//" - there were no distinguishing features–just water covering everything
    * //"dark and empty" - //  the creation began without light, but God could still see all he has made He would fill the creation with life and light.
    * //God's Spirit - //  the Spirit of God is free to move about and examine what he had made. God is close to his creation, he knows all about it, and he is not far away from it.
    * //God created … God's Spirit was there" -//  God moves in many ways in and over his creation. He is free to act as he wants.
