{{:en:obs:obs-08-05.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

His master’s wife **tried to sleep with [[:en:key-terms:joseph|Joseph]]**, but **[[:en:key-terms:joseph|Joseph]]** refused to **[[:en:key-terms:sin|sin]] against [[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** in this way. She became angry and **had [[:en:key-terms:joseph|Joseph]] arrested** and sent to prison. Even in prison, **[[:en:key-terms:joseph|Joseph]] remained [[:en:key-terms:faith|faithful]]** to **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]**, and **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** **[[:en:key-terms:bless|blessed]]** him.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **tried to sleep with Joseph** – Another way to say this would be, “tried to seduce Joseph to have sex with her.” To “sleep with” is a way of expressing this in order not to be crude or offensive. 
  * **sin against God** - It is against God's law for people to have sex if they are not married to each other. Joseph did not want to sin by disobeying God's law.
  * **had Joseph arrested** – It may be more clear to say, “lied about Joseph so that her husband had him arrested.” 
  * **remained faithful to God** - Another way to say this would be, “continued to obey God.”
