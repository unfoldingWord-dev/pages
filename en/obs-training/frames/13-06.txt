===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **Do not commit adultery** - This could be translated as, "Do not have sexual relations with someone else's spouse" or, “Do not have marital relations with another man's wife or another woman's husband.” Be sure to translate this in a way that doesn't offend or embarrass people. Languages often have an indirect, polite way of saying this, such as, “Do not sleep with.”
  * **Do not lie** - This means, "Do not say false things about other people."
