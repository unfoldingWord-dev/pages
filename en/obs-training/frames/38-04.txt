**[[:en:key-terms:jesus|Jesus]]** celebrated the **[[:en:key-terms:passover|Passover Feast]]** with his **[[:en:key-terms:disciple|disciples]]**. During the meal Jesus took bread and broke it, saying, “Take and eat this. **It is my body, which is broken for you.** **Do this to remember me.**” In this way, Jesus said that his body would be **[[:en:key-terms:sacrifice|sacrificed]]** for them.


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **It is my body, which is broken for you.** - This is generally understood to mean, "This bread represents my body, which will be broken for your sake." However, some Christian traditions believe the broken bread somehow becomes literally or mystically connected to Jesus. Translate this phrase as literally as possible to allow for both meanings if it will be understandable in your language.
  * **Do this to remember me.** - That is, "Do this as a way to remember me."
