He said, “Take and eat this. **This is my body**, which is **given for you.** **Do this to remember me.**” In this way, Jesus said that his body would be **[[:en:key-terms:sacrifice|sacrificed]]** for them.


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **celebrated** – That is, “was celebrating.”  
  * **took some bread** – This could be translated as, “picked up a piece of bread” or, “picked up a flat loaf of bread.”
  * **broke it** – Some languages should say, “tore it in pieces” or, “tore it in half” or, “tore off part of it.” 
  * **This is my body** – Some Christian traditions understand this to mean, “This bread represents my body.” Views of other Christian traditions say that the broken break literally and supernaturally takes on the same substance as Jesus body. If possible, translate this in a way that will allow both understandings. 
  * **given for you** - This can also be translated as, “which I give up for you.”
  * **Do this to remember me** - That is, “Do this as a way to remind yourselves of what I am doing for you.” Jesus was referring to his coming death.
