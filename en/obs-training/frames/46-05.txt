===== Translation Notes: =====

  * (**Ananias** - A disciple of Jesus in Damascus. See **[[:en:obs-training:frames:46-04|[46-04]]]**.)
  * **on your way** - That is, "on the way to Damascus."
  * **regain your sight** - This could also be translated as, "be able to see again."
  * **his strength returned** - This could also be translated as, “he became strong again” or, “he felt better.” He had not eaten or drunk for three days, so he was probably feeling weak from that. When he ate, he felt better.
