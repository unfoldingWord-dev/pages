====== God Spoke to Zechariah [22-01] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-22-01.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

In the past, **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** had spoken to **his people** through his **[[:en:key-terms:angel|angels]]** and **[[:en:key-terms:prophet|prophets]]**. But then **400 years went by when he did not speak to them**. Suddenly an angel came with a message from God to an old **[[:en:key-terms:priest|priest]]** named **[[:en:key-terms:zechariah-nt|Zechariah]]**. Zechariah and his wife, Elizabeth, were **godly people**, but she had not been able to have any children.


===== Translation Notes: =====
  * **his people** - This could be translated as, “his people, the Israelites” or “his people, the Jews.” But only include the added information if it is not clearly understood who these people were. 
  * **400 years went by** - Another way to say this would be, “400 years passed" or "there were 400 years.” 400 years had passed since the last Old Testament prophet, Malachi.
  * **when he did not speak to them** – That is, “during which God did not give any messages to the prophets for his people.” 
  * **godly people** - That is, “people who obeyed God.”
