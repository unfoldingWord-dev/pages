===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **not counting the women and children** - That is, “not counting the women and children who were with them” or, “and there were also women and children in addition to the men.” Another way to translate this could also be, “The crowd had over 5,000 men in it; in addition, there were many women and children.”
  * **kindness** – This could also be translated as, “compassion.”
  * **To Jesus** – That is, “Jesus knew that” or, “Jesus understood that.”
  * **like sheep without a shepherd** - This could be translated as, “vulnerable and lost, just like sheep are when they have no shepherd to take care of them.”
  * **their sick** - That is, “their sick people” or, “the people among them who were sick.”
