  * **five months** - the ark floated freely for five additional months after the forty days of rain
  * **boat rested** - became stuck on the top of a mountain that was not yet visible under the water
  * **three more months** - the ark was stuck on the mountain top for three months before the water went down enough to see the mountains
  * **mountains were visible** - the water finally receded enough that the highest peaks could be seen
