  * **They were to roast** - They were supposed to do this (because God told them to). To make this clear it could be translated as, “God told them to roast…”. 
  * **made without yeast** – Yeast is something that is mixed into bread dough to make bread rise as it cooks. This could be translated as “made without something that would make it rise.”
