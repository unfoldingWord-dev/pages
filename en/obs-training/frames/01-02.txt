Then **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]] spoke and said**, "**Let there be** light!" And there was **light**. **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** saw that the light **was [[:en:key-terms:good|good]]** and called it "day." He separated it from the darkness, which He called "night." **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** created the light on the first day of **creation**.
===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]] ... said**- God created light by means of a simple verbal command.
    * **let there be**  - This is a command that happened immediately because it was spoken by God. It may be more natural to translate this as a statement of certainty that this would definitely happen. For example, you could translate this as, “God said, 'There will be light.'”
    * **light**  - This was a special light that God created–the sun was not created until later.
    * **was [[:en:key-terms:good|good]]**- This phrase is often repeated through the Creation story, and emphasizes that each stage of creation was pleasing to God and accomplished His plan and purpose.
    * **creation**  - The six-day period during which God made everything that exists.
