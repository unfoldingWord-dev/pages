====== 01-02. Light Created ======


{{:en:obs:obs-01-02.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Then **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** spoke and said, "Let there be light!" And there was light. **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** saw that the light was **[[:en:key-terms:good|good]]** and called it "day." He separated it from the darkness, which He called "night." **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** created the light on the first day of creation.


===== Emphasis: =====

Only darkness existed. But God simply spoke and light happened! The light was pleasing to God. The light contrasted with the darkness, and became the basis for counting the days. One period of dark and one period of light equals one 24-hour day. 


===== Translation Notes: =====


    * "//God spoke//" - God created light by means of a simple verbal command
    * "//light"// - a special supernatural light from God, the sun had not yet been created
    * "//light ... darkness"// - light and darkness are often contrasted in the Bible stories, and sometimes serve as an illustration of good and evil
    * "//it was good"// - the declaration of the goodness of the creation is repeated through this section
    * "//creation"// - the six-day period during which God made everything that exists
