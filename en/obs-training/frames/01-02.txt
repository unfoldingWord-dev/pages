Then **God spoke**and said, "Let there be **light**!" (CL: 'light' not a k.t.) And there was **light**. **God ** saw that the **light ** was **good ** and called it "**day**." He separated it from the darkness, which He called "night." **God ** created the **light ** on the first **day ** of **creation**.

    * **[[:en:key-terms:h216|light]]**- a special light provided by God–the sun did not yet exist

=== Translation Notes: ===


Pay close attention to …


    * note …
    * (CL: Note that in this verse and those that follow, creation was just as God intended it to be. [In the Heb. this is inferred as the exact wording of creation coming to pass parallels the wording of God's creating commands.]) –-maybe this note doesn't belong in this section, but rather the theological notes/q&a section?
    * (CL: Note that the light being created here was a light that did not have the sun as its source. It is a possibility that God himself was the source of this light (cf. Ps. 104:2 & Rev. 21:3), but the Scriptures do not explicitly tell us.) --Again, not sure that this is the correct place for this note or not.
