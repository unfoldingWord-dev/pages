Then **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** spoke and said, "Let there be light!" And there was light. **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** saw that the light was **[[:en:key-terms:good|good]]** and called it "day." He separated it from the darkness, which He called "night." **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** created the light on the first day of creation.


===== Emphasis: =====

Only darkness existed. But God simply spoke and light happened! The light was pleasing to God. The light contrasted with the darkness, and became the basis for counting the days. The period of darkness following the period of light counted as the first day.
