Then **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** spoke and said, "Let there be light!" And there was light. **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** saw that the light was **[[:en:key-terms:good|good]]** and called it "day." He separated it from the darkness, which He called "night." **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** created the light on the first day of creation.


===== Emphasis: =====

Only darkness existed. But God simply spoke and light happened! The light was pleasing to God. The light contrasted with the darkness, and became the basis for counting the days. The period of darkness following the period of light counted as the first day.


===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **God spoke** - God created light by means of a simple verbal command
    * **light** - a special light created God--the sun was not created until later
    * **light ... darkness** - light and darkness are often contrasted as opposite concepts in the Bible stories, and sometimes serve as an illustration of good and evil
    * **was good** - this phrase is often repeated through the Creation story, emphasizing that each stage of creation was pleasing to Him and accomplished His plan and purpose
    * **creation** - the six-day period during which God made everything that exists
