Then **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** said, "Let there be light!" And there was light. **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** saw that the light was **[[:en:key-terms:good|good]]** and called the light "day." He separated it from the darkness, which He called "night." **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** created the light on the first day of creation.


===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]] said** - God created light by speaking a command. Throughout the creation story, consider whether it may be more natural to quote God's words directly, or to refer to what He said indirectly, like this: “God spoke and commanded light to come into being,” or, “God spoke and commanded that there be light.”
    * **let there be**  - This is a command that happened immediately because it was spoken by God. It may be more natural to translate this as a statement of certainty that this would definitely happen. For example, you could translate this as, “God said, 'There will be light.'”
    * **light**  - This was a special light that God created–the sun was not created until later.
    * **was [[:en:key-terms:good|good]]** - This phrase is often repeated through the Creation story, and emphasizes that each stage of creation was pleasing to God and accomplished His plan and purpose.
    * **day**  - In this frame, "day" is used in two ways: as the name of the light that God created, and also as the repeating period of time that has both a morning and an evening.
    * **creation**  - The six-day period during which God made everything that exists.
