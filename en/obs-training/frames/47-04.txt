The **[[:en:key-terms:servant| slave girl]]** kept yelling, “These men are **[[:en:key-terms:servant|servants]]** of the **[[:en:key-terms:god|Most High God]]**. They are telling you **the way to be [[:en:key-terms:save|saved]]**!” She did this so often that **[[:en:key-terms:paul|Paul]]** became annoyed.


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **the way to be saved** - That is, “how you can be saved” or, “how God saves people” or, “God's plan for saving people.”
