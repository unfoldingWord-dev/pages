====== The Dove [03-11] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-03-11.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Later **[[:en:key-terms:noah|Noah]]** sent out a bird called a dove. But it also could not find any dry land, so it came back to **[[:en:key-terms:noah|Noah]]**. A week later he sent the dove out again, and it came back with an olive branch in its beak! The water was going down, and the plants were growing again!


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **it came back** - the first time the dove went out, it could not find a place to land. It returned to the ark.
  * **olive branch** - the fresh green branch of an olive tree which would be growing after the flood
  * **water was going down** - the olive tree could not grow unless the water went down enough for dry ground to appear
  * **plants were growing again** - all of the plants died during the year the flood covered the earth. Ndew plants were now growing from seeds.
