Later **[[:en:key-terms:noah|Noah]]** sent out a bird called a **[[:en:key-terms:dove|dove]]**. But it also could not find any dry land, so it came back to **[[:en:key-terms:noah|Noah]]**. A week later he sent the **[[:en:key-terms:dove|dove]]** out again, and it came back with an **[[:en:key-terms:olive|olive]]** branch in its beak! The water was going down, and the plants were growing again!


=== Translation Notes: ===


Pay close attention to ...


  * "//it came back//" - the first time the dove went out, it could not find a place to land. It returned to the ark.
  * "//olive branch//" - the fresh green branch of an olive tree which would be growing after the flood
  * "//water was going down//" - the olive tree could not grow unless the water went down enough for dry ground to appear
  * "//plants were growing again//" - all of the plants died during the year the flood covered the earth. Ndew plants were now growing from seeds.
