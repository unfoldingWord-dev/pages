====== The People Ignored God [14-09] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-14-09.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

When the people heard this, they were sorry **they had [[:en:key-terms:sin|sinned]]**. They took their weapons and went to attack **[[:en:key-terms:canaan|Canaan]]**. **[[:en:key-terms:moses|Moses]] warned them not to go** because **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]] was not with them**, **but they did not listen to him**.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **they had sinned** - It may be necessary to add, “they had sinned by disobeying God's command to conquer the peoples of Canaan.” 
  * **Canaan** - It might be more clear to say, "the people of Canaan." 
  * **Moses warned them not to go** - This means that Moses told them not to go to fight against the Canaanites because they would be in danger if they did that. 
  * **God was not with them** – In other words, God would not be with them to help them. Because of the Israelites' disobedience, God withdrew from them his presence, protection, and power. 
  * **but they did not listen to him** - They did not obey Moses. They went to attack the Canaanites anyway.
