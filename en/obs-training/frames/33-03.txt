====== The Seed on the Rocks [33-03] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-33-03.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

“Other seeds fell on **a rocky place**, where there was not much soil. The seeds in the rocky soil sprouted quickly. But when the sun came up and it got hot, the plants withered and died since their roots **did not go deep**.”


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * Jesus continues the story.
  * **a rocky place** - That is, "rock ground" or, "soil full of rocks."
  * **did not go deep** - Some translations may need to add, "did not go very deep into the soil" or, "were not able to go deep into the ground."
