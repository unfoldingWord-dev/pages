===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **covered their ears** - This could also be translated as, “They put their hands over their ears.” This was to show that they did not want to hear what Stephen said.  
  * **yelled loudly** - They were yelling in anger. Translate this in a way that communicates that they were very upset.
