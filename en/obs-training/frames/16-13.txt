Then, all of **[[:en:key-terms:gideon|Gideon's]]** soldiers broke their pots at the same moment, suddenly revealing the fire of the torches. They blew their horns and **shouted**, “**A sword for [[:en:key-terms:god|God]] and for Gideon**!”


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **shouted** - This could be translated as, “yelled loudly” or “said with a very loud voice.” 
  * **sword** - A sword is a weapon that has a long sharp blade and a handle at one end. People hold the handle and hit or stab the enemy with the sharp blade. If your people don't have a weapon just like this, you could translate it as a 'long knife,' 'machete,' or 'bushknife.'
  * **A sword for God and for Gideon** -  This means, “We fight for God and for Gideon!”
