====== Manna from Heaven [14-11] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-14-11.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

During the forty years that the people of Israel wandered in the wilderness, **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]] provided for them**. He gave them **bread from heaven, called “manna.” He also sent flocks of quail** (which are medium-sized birds) **into their camp** so they could have meat to eat. During all that time, God kept their clothes and shoes from wearing out.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **God provided for them** – This could be translated as, “God gave them everything they needed for food, water, and shelter.” 
  * **bread from heaven, called “manna”** - This could be translated as, “He caused a special kind of grain to appear on the grass like dew. They called it 'manna.'” Almost every day the people gathered this grain and used it like flour to make bread. 
  * **He also sent flocks of quail...camp** - Another way to say this would be, “He also caused a large number of quails to fly into their camp.” If quails are unknown, a different, similar type bird could be used. Or it could be translated as, “a large number of medium-sized birds.”   
  * **their camp** - The Israelites moved around together in the wilderness, and when they stopped, they would stop together in one large place and set up their tents to sleep in. That place where they all set up their tents was a camp. It was like a city with tents instead of buildings, and it could be moved around.
