====== The Raven [03-10] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-03-10.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


After forty more days, **[[:en:key-terms:noah|Noah]]** sent out a bird called a raven to see if the water had dried up. The raven flew back and forth looking for dry land, but it could not find any.

===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **raven** - a black bird similar to a crow. It was large and strong enough to fly a great distance
  * **looking for dry land** - if the raven found dry ground, it would have stayed there. However, it returned to the ark when it could not find a place to rest.
