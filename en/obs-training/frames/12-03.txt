**After a short time**, **[[:en:key-terms:pharaoh|Pharaoh]]** and his people **changed their minds** and wanted the **[[:en:key-terms:israel|Israelites]]** to be their **[[:en:key-terms:servant|slaves]]** again. **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]] did this to get glory for himself** by showing that He is more powerful than Pharaoh and his gods.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **After a short time** – Probably at least two days had gone by. For that to be clear, it may be necessary to say, “After a few days” or “A few days after the Israelites left Egypt.” 
  * **changed their minds** - This phrase is an idiom that means “began to think differently than they had before.” Some languages may not have an idiom for this and will need to express the meaning in a direct way. 
  * **God did this** – This means, “God caused (or allowed) Pharaoh and the Egyptian people to stubbornly keep on refusing to obey him.” 
  * **God did this to get glory for himself** - This means, “God made Pharaoh be stubborn in order that people would see God's power and know that he is the one true God when he rescued the Israelites from the Egyptians.”
