{{:en:obs:obs-12-03.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

**After a short time**, **[[:en:key-terms:pharaoh|Pharaoh]]** and his people **changed their minds** and wanted the **[[:en:key-terms:israel|Israelites]]** to be their **[[:en:key-terms:servant|slaves]]** again. **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** caused Pharaoh to be stubborn so that people would see he is the One True God, and understand that he, Yahweh, is more powerful than Pharaoh and his **[[:en:key-terms:god-false|gods]]**.


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **After a short time** – Probably at least two days had gone by. For that to be clear, it may be necessary to say, “After a few days” or, “A few days after the Israelites left Egypt.” 
  * **changed their minds** - This phrase is an idiom that means “began to think differently than they had before.” Some languages may not have an idiom for this and will need to express the meaning in a direct way.
