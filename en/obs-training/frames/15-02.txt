====== Crossing the Jordan River [15-02] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-15-02.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

The **[[:en:key-terms:israel|Israelites]]** had to cross the **[[:en:key-terms:jordan-river|Jordan River]]** to enter into the **[[:en:key-terms:promised-land|Promised Land]]**. **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** told **[[:en:key-terms:joshua|Joshua]]**, “**Have the [[:en:key-terms:priest|priests]] go first**.” **When the priests' feet touched the Jordan River**, **the water upstream stopped flowing** so the Israelites could **cross over on dry ground**.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **Have the priests go first** – For some languages it may be necessary to say, “Have the priests go before the rest of the people to cross the river.” 
  * **When the priests' feet touched the Jordan River** - This can be translated as, “When the priests started to step into the Jordan River.” 
  * **the water upstream stopped flowing** — In some languages it may be helpful to add, “and the water in front of them flowed away downstream.” 
  * **cross over on dry ground** – This could be translated as, “cross over on dry ground to the other side of the river” or “walk across the dry riverbed to the opposite riverbank."
