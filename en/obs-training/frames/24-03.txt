====== A Baptism of Repentance [24-03] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-24-03.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

Some people **[[:en:key-terms:repent|repented]]** and **were [[:en:key-terms:baptize|baptized]]** when they heard **[[:en:key-terms:john-baptist|John's]]** message. Many **[[:en:key-terms:jewish-leaders|religious leaders]]** also came to be baptized by John, but they **did not repent** or **confess their [[:en:key-terms:sin|sins]]**.


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **were baptized** - It may be necessary to add, "were baptized by John..."
  * **did not repent** - That is, "did not turn away from their sins."
  * **confess their sins** - To confess is to acknowledge that something is true. These leaders did not want to acknowledge that they had sinned. This may be translated as "confess that they had sinned."
