Meanwhile, the **[[:en:key-terms:disciple|disciples']] boat** was a **long way** from land. They were in danger of sinking, because **a storm had come up** and the boat was being **tossed around** by the waves and the wind.

After rowing their boat for many hours, the **[[:en:key-terms:disciple|disciples]]** had reached the middle of the lake. They were rowing with great difficulty because the wind was blowing hard against them.
