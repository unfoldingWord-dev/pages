===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **At last it was time for** - "At last" means "finally" or "after a long wait." To make it clear what “time” refers to, it may be necessary to say, ”…after 40 years of wandering in the desert God finally permitted…”  
  * **enter** – If this word is only used for going into a house or through a door, it could be translated here as, “go into” or “go across the border of.” 
  * **two spies to the Canaanite city of Jericho** - This could be translated as, "two men to Jericho, a city in Canaan, to find out information about it.” Also see the notes for “spy out the land” in [14-04]. 
  * **It was protected by strong walls** - This could be translated as, “The city was completely surrounded by thick, strong walls made of stone to protect it from their enemies.” 
  * **escape** – It may be necessary to say, ”…escape from people in Jericho who wanted to harm them.”
  * **protect Rahab and her family** - This could be translated as, “keep Rahab and her family safe.” She asked for protection for her father, mother, brothers, and sisters. Use your word for family that includes these people. 
  * **when Jericho was destroyed** - This could be translated as, “when the Israelites would destroy Jericho.”
