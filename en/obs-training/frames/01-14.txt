====== 01-14. Adam Meets Eve ======


{{:en:obs:obs-01-14.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


When **[[:en:key-terms:adam|Adam]]** saw her, he said, "At last! This one is like me! Let her be called 'Woman,' for she was made from Man." This is why a man leaves his father and mother and becomes one with his wife.


===== Emphasis: =====


When Adam saw the woman, he knew his search for a creature who was like him was finally over! He called her "Woman" because that name means she was formed from a man's own body. Because of this, a man's marriage bond with his wife would be even stronger than his relationship to his parents. The man and his wife would be united as one. 


===== Translation Notes: =====


    * "//at last" //- Adam sees in the woman someone who was able to help him.
    * "//like//" - the woman was similar to Adam, but also different enough to complete him
    * "//woman//" - the feminine form of the word for man
    * "//made from//" - she was literally "taken out of" Adam. 
    * "//man//" - a generic term for an adult man.
    * "//one//" - literally "the same flesh and bone."
