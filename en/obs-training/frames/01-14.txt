====== Adam Meets Eve [01-14] ======


{{:en:obs:obs-01-14.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


When **[[:en:key-terms:adam|Adam]]** saw her, he said, "At last! This one is like me! Let her be called 'Woman,' for she was made from Man." This is why a man leaves his father and mother and becomes one with his wife.


===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **At last!** - Adam's exclamation indicates that he had been waiting for something like the woman. He had already realized that there were male and female versions of the animals, but there was no female version of himself.
    * **like me** - The woman was the same type of being as Adam, even though there were important differences between them.
    * **Woman** - This word is the feminine form of the word for man.
    * **made from man** - The woman was formed directly from a rib from Adam's own body.
    * **a man leaves** - This is stated in the present tense to indicate what would become the normal situation. Adam did not have a mother or father, but all other men would. When they married, their relationship with their wives would become a higher priority than their relationship to their parents.
    * **becomes one** - The husband and wife will share an intimate bond of unity and a commitment to one another that will surpass their relationships to anyone else.
