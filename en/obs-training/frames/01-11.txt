{{:en:obs:obs-01-11.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


In the middle of the garden, **God ** planted two special trees—the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of **good** and **evil**. **God**  told **Adam**  that he could eat from any tree in the garden except from the tree of the knowledge of **good** and **evil**. If he ate from this tree, he would **die**.
