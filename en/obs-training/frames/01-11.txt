====== 01-11. Two Trees ======


{{:en:obs:obs-01-11.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


In the middle of the garden, **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** planted two special treesâ€”the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of **[[:en:key-terms:good|good]]** and **[[:en:key-terms:evil|evil]]**. **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]**  told **[[:en:key-terms:Adam|Adam]]**  that he could eat from any tree in the garden except from the tree of the knowledge of **[[:en:key-terms:good|good]]** and **[[:en:key-terms:evil|evil]]**. If he ate from this tree, he would **[[:en:key-terms:die|die]]**.


===== Emphasis: =====


God placed two trees with very special importance right in the center of the garden. The fruit of the tree of life would enable Adam to live forever. The fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil would cause Adam to understand and experience evil as well as good. This was a test to see if Adam would obey and be satisfied to know only that which was good. The fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil was the only fruit that God commanded Adam not to eat. God warned Adam that the fruit of this tree would kill him.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * "//garden//" - a special collection of trees and plants that God prepared for Adam 
  * "//tree of life//" - a literal tree with fruit that could keep a person alive continually 
  * "//tree of knowledge of good and evil//" - a literal tree with fruit that could enable a person to know the difference between good and evil
