Then **[[:en:key-terms:jesus|Jesus]]** asked the **law expert**, “What do you think? Which one of **the three men** **was a [[:en:key-terms:neighbor|neighbor]]** to the man who was robbed and beaten?” He replied, “The one **who showed [[:en:key-terms:mercy|mercy]]**.” Jesus told him, “**You go and do the same**.”


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **law expert** - That is, "an expert in the Jewish law." See how you translated this term in **[[:en:obs-training:frames:27-01|[27-01]]]**.
  * **the three men** - The three men were the priest, the Levite, and the Samaritan.
  * **was a neighbor** - This can also be translated as “behaved as a neighbor” or, “was a friend” or, “acted in a loving way”. See how you translated “neighbor” in **[[:en:obs-training:frames:27-02|[27-02]]]** and **[[:en:obs-training:frames:27-03|[27-03]]]**. 
  * **who showed mercy** – That is, “who was merciful to him.” 
  * **You go and do** – That is, “You, too, should go and do” or, “Now you must do.” Jesus was commanding the law expert to do the same. 
  * **do the same** – That is, “love others, even your enemies.” Make sure it does not sound like “same thing” is only referring to helping a wounded man.
