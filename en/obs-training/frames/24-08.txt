===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **came out of the water** - This might be translated as, "came up out of the water after being baptized."
  * **took the appearance of a dove** - It is also possible to say, "appeared in the form of a dove."
  * **landed on** -  That is, “came down and alighted on him” or, ”came down and rested on him.” 
  * **a voice** - That is, “God's voice.” 
  * **my beloved Son** - That is, “my Son whom I love” or, “my very dear Son.” Make sure the translation of this does not sound like there was another son. It may be necessary to say, “You are my Son. I love you very much and am very pleased with you.”
