====== The Mustard Seed [34-01] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-34-01.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

**[[:en:key-terms:jesus|Jesus]]** told many other stories and **parables** about the **[[:en:key-terms:kingdom-of-god|Kingdom of God]]**. For example, he said, “The Kingdom of God is like a **mustard seed** that someone planted in his field. When the mustard seed is a seed, it is **the smallest seed of all**.”


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **parables** - 
  * **mustard seed** - This probably refers to the seed of the black mustard plant, which has tiny seeds that rapidly grow into very large plants. If there is a word for this plant in your language, you should use it. If not, you may need to substitute the name of another plant which has the same characteristics.
  * **the smallest seed of all** - That is, "the smallest of all the seeds that are planted."
