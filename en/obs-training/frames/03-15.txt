{{:en:obs:obs-03-15.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** said, “I **[[:en:key-terms:promise|promise]]** I will **never again [[:en:key-terms:curse|curse]] the ground because of humans** or destroy **the world with a flood**, even though humans are **[[:en:key-terms:sin|sinful]] from their youth**.”


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **never again** - This means, “not ever again” or, “not again at any time” or, “truly not again”. Examples: "I will not ever again curse the ground,” or “I will not curse the ground again at any time” or, “I will truly not curse the ground again”.
  * **curse the ground** - The earth and the other creatures suffered because of man's sin.
  * **because of humans** – This means, “because of the evil things that people do.” [vs “because of people's sinfulness”]
  * **the world** – This refers to the earth and the living creatures that lived on it.
  * **with a flood** - This means, “by causing a flood.” God will not ever again destroy the earth in this way.
  * **sinful from their youth** - This means, “even from the time they are children.” Another way to say this would be, “people do sinful things their entire lives.”
