**God** said, “I will never again **curse** the ground because of humans or destroy the world with a flood, even though humans are **sinful** from their youth.”


=== Key Terms: ===

 
  * **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** - Almighty, creator, sinless and perfect
  * **[[:en:key-terms:curse|curse]]** - to express an intention to cause bad or negative things to happen to someone
  * **[[:en:key-terms:sin|sinful]]** - something that is opposed to the way God desires for us to think and act


=== Translation Notes: ===


Pay close attention to ...


  * "//never again//" - there will not be another worldwide flood
  * "//curse the ground//" - the earth and the other creatures suffered because of man's sin
  * "//with a flood//" - God may judge the earth again, but not by means of a flood
  * "//sinful from their youth//" - the flood showed how much God hates sin. But it did not solve the problem of sin in the world. Sin is passed from parent to child, and so all people will continue to be sinners.
