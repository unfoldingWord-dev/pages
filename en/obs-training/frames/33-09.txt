“But the **[[:en:key-terms:good|good]]** soil on which the seeds fell represents people who hear the **[[:en:key-terms:word-of-god|Word of God]]**, **[[:en:key-terms:believe|believe]]** it, and **produce fruit**.”


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **produce fruit** - This expression refers to the good works that a believer does, as well as the positive changes in his character. If this contrast will be understood in your language, translate this phrase literally with a general word for “fruit.” If it will be confusing, you may need to translate it with a phrase such as, “good works” or, “a changed life.” (see previous frame)
