====== The Gibeonites' Lie [15-06] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-15-06.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

**[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** had commanded the **[[:en:key-terms:israel|Israelites]]** not to make a **[[:en:key-terms:peace|peace]]** treaty with any **[[:en:key-terms:canaan|Canaanites]]**. **But the Canaanite tribe of [[:en:key-terms:gibeon|Gibeon]]** lied to **[[:en:key-terms:joshua|Joshua]]** and said they were from far away. They asked Joshua to **make peace with** them. Joshua and the Israelites did not ask God **where the [[:en:key-terms:gibeon|Gibeonites]] were from**. So Joshua made a peace treaty with them.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **peace treaty** – This is an agreement between two groups of people that they will not harm each other but will live in peace. This could be translated as, “peace agreement.”
  * **But the Canaanite tribe of Gibeon** – Some languages will need to introduce this as, “But one day a Canaanite tribe by the name of Gibeon came to the Israelites and asked to make a peace treaty with them. They lied and said that they were from a far-away country. 
  * **lied to Joshua and said** - This could be translated as, “They lied to Joshua by saying,” or “They falsely said to Joshua,” or “They falsely told Joshua.”
  * **where the Gibeonites were from** - That is, “where the Gibeonites lived” or “where the Gibeonites' home was.”
