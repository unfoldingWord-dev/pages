====== The Attempt to Kill Jesus [26-07] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-26-07.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

The people of **[[:en:key-terms:nazareth|Nazareth]]** dragged **[[:en:key-terms:jesus|Jesus]]** out of the place of **[[:en:key-terms:worship|worship]]** and brought him to the edge of a cliff **to throw him off**. **But Jesus walked through the crowd** and left the town of Nazareth.


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **to throw him off** - That is, "to throw him off in order to kill him."
  * **But Jesus walked through the crowd** - "But" should be translated with a conjunction or phrase that indicates a sharp contrast between the crowd dragging Jesus to the cliff, and Jesus being able to walk unharmed and unhindered through the crowd and leave.
