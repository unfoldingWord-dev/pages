    * **the fifth day** - God continues His orderly progression of creation that He started during the previous four days. 
    * **everything that swims** - God not only made fish, but every kind of living thing that lives in the waters. Every one exists because God chose to create them.
    * **all the birds** - Diversity is a major theme in God's creation. He does not make just one kind of bird, but all of the amazing variety of shapes, sizes, colors, and kinds of birds. He fills the sky with evidence of His power and the artistic beauty.
    * **was [[:en:key-terms:good|good]]** - This phrase is again repeated to show that every step of creation went exactly according to God's wise plan and purpose.
    * **[[:en:key-terms:bless|blessed]] them** - That is, He speaks His desire that they would prosper and things would go well for them in the world in which He had placed them.
