On the fifth day, **God** **created** everything that swims in the water and all the birds. **God ** saw that it was **good**, and He **blessed** them.
=== Key Terms: ===


    * **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]**- Almighty, creator, sinless and perfect (suggest add: God reveals himself in what he has made: eternal and infinite, the one who loves and saves – TW)
    * **[[:en:key-terms:create|created]]**- "created from nothing," or "caused to exist" (to be created by God implies that the things created have a grand purpose and a place in the balance of nature, and it its ultimate destiny – TW)
    * **[[:en:key-terms:good|good]]**- in agreement with God's character and purposes (seen in the choices and decisions of God – TW)
    * **[[:en:key-terms:bless|blessed]]**- God spoke to his intent to make things go well for them (the things created aligned with God's purpose and they pleased him – TW)
=== Translation Notes: ===


Pay close attention to …


    * "//day//" - a literal 24-hour period (LS: moved from KT)-(TW - could we say, "each day has a morning and an evening." To require 24 hour, may be asking for a particular view of creation. Note Gen. 2:4 refers to the entire creation as a "day." Same word, //yom, // as in Gen 1. )
    * "//everything" - //  all creation is connected to God. Everything in the world, all that is contained in the universe, all of it is there because God personally worked to make every part of creation and to bring it all into existence. All creation ("everything") is dependent upon the Creator for existence. (TW)
