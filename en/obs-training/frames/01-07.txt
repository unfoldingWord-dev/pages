====== 01-07. Birds and Fish Created ======


{{:en:obs:obs-01-07.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


On the fifth day, **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** created everything that swims in the water and all the birds. **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** saw that it was **[[:en:key-terms:good|good]]**, and He **[[:en:key-terms:bless|blessed]]** them.


===== Emphasis: =====

The next thing God created was an amazing variety of every kind of birds to fill the sky and fish to fill the seas. They would use the plants for food and shelter. This was all according to God's good plan. He blessed them by telling them to multiply and fill His creation. He did all of this on the fifth day.
 

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * "//day//" - a literal 24-hour period 
    * "//everything" - //  all creation is connected to God. Everything in the world, all that is contained in the universe, all of it is there because God personally worked to make every part of creation and to bring it all into existence.
