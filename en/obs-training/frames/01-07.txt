=== Key Terms: ===


    * **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]**- Almighty, creator, sinless and perfect
    * **[[:en:key-terms:create|created]]**- "created from nothing," or "caused to exist"
    * **[[:en:key-terms:good|good]]**- in agreement with God's character and purposes
    * **[[:en:key-terms:bless|blessed]]**- God spoke to his intent to make things go well for them
=== Translation Notes: ===


Pay close attention to â€¦


    * "//day//" - a literal 24-hour period (LS: moved from KT)-(TW - could we say, "each day has a morning and an evening." To require 24 hour, may be asking for a particular view of creation.)
    * "//everything" - //  all creation is connected to God. Everything in the world, all that is contained in the universe, all of it is there because God personally worked to make every part of creation and to bring it all into existence. Nothing can come to be except that God makes it. (TW)
