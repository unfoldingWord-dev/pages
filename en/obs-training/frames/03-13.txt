Two months later **God** said to **Noah**, “You and your family and all the animals may leave the boat now. Have many children and grandchildren and fill the earth.” So they **obeyed** and left the boat.


=== Key Terms: ===

 
  * **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** - Almighty, creator, sinless and perfect
  * **[[:en:key-terms:noah|Noah]]** - righteous man who built the ark and survived the flood
  * **[[:en:key-terms:obey|obey]]** - literally "to hear," meaning to do what was commanded


=== Translation Notes: ===


Pay close attention to ...


  * "//Two months later//" - two months after the dove left the ark
  * "//leave the boat//" - the earth was finally dry enough for them to live outside the ark
  * "//fill the earth//" - no one survived the flood except Noah's family. Noah's three sons and their wives were responsible to have children to begin to fill the earth again.
