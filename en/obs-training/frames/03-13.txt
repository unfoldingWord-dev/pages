  * **Two months later** - two months after the dove left the ark
  * **leave the boat** - the earth was finally dry enough for them to live outside the ark
  * **fill the earth** - no one survived the flood except Noah's family. Noah's three sons and their wives were responsible to have children to begin to fill the earth again.
