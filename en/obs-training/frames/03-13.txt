====== Leaving the Boat [03-13] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-03-13.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**Two months later [[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** said to **[[:en:key-terms:noah|Noah]]**, “You and your family and all the animals may leave the boat now. **Have many children** and grandchildren and **fill the earth**.” So **[[:en:key-terms:noah|Noah]]** and his family **left the boat**.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **Two months later** - This means two months after Noah released the dove from the ark. It may be necessary to say this explicitly if it is not clear.
  * **Have many children** – To make sure it is clear that this was God's command and desire, you could say “You must have….” or, “I want you to have…”
  * **fill the earth** - If this is not clear, it may be necessary to say, “and fill the earth with people” or, ”…so that there will be many people living on the earth.”
  * **left the boat** - Or you could say, “came out of the boat.” Make sure it does not sound like they went a great distance away. They probably stayed nearby the boat after they got off the boat and sacrificed to God (see next frame).
