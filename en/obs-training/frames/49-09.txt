But **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** **[[:en:key-terms:love|loved]]** everyone in the world so much that he **gave his only [[:en:key-terms:god-son|Son]]** so that **whoever [[:en:key-terms:believe|believes]] in [[:en:key-terms:jesus|Jesus]] will not be [[:en:key-terms:punish|punished]] for his [[:en:key-terms:sin|sins]], but will [[:en:key-terms:life|live]] with God forever**.
