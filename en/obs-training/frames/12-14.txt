===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **remember how God gave them victory over** – This could be translated as, “regularly remind themselves of how God defeated.” The word “remember” here doesn't just mean to not forget; it also means to formally commemorate something.
  * **the Passover** - This could be translated as, “the Passover activities” or, “the Passover celebration” or, “the Passover meal.” 
  * **perfect lamb** - The word “perfect” here refers to a lamb with no disease or anything else wrong with it. Another way to say this might be, “a completely healthy and well-formed lamb.” 
  * **unleavened bread** - This is another way to say, "bread that was made without yeast."
  * //A Bible story from// - These references may be slightly different in some Bible translations.
