**[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** commanded the **[[:en:key-terms:israel|Israelites]]** to **remember His victory** over the **[[:en:key-terms:egypt|Egyptians]]** and **their deliverance from [[:en:key-terms:servant|slavery]] by celebrating the [[:en:key-terms:passover|Passover]]** every year. They celebrated by killing a **perfect [[:en:key-terms:lamb|lamb]]**, eating it with **unleavened bread**, and celebrating how God had **[[:en:key-terms:save|saved]]** them from the Egyptians.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **remember His victory** – This could be translated as, “regularly remind themselves of how God defeated.” The word “remember” here doesn't just mean to not forget; it also means to formally commemorate something.
  * **their deliverance from slavery** - This could be translated as, “how God had rescued them from being slaves.” 
  * **by celebrating the Passover** - This could be translated as, “by observing the Passover activities” or, “by having the Passover celebration” or, “by eating the Passover meal.” 
  * **perfect lamb** - The word “perfect” here refers to a lamb with no disease or anything else wrong with it. Another way to say this might be, “a completely healthy and well-formed lamb.” 
  * **unleavened bread** - This is another way to say, "bread that was made without yeast."
