===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **these Ten Commandments** - This refers to the commands God gave to Moses for the Israelites to obey.
  * **stone tablets** - These were flat pieces of stone. 
  * **God also gave many other laws and rules** - This can be translated as, “God also told them many other laws and rules.” 
  * **to follow** - This can be translated as, “to obey” or "to keep."
  * **punish them** - Another way to say this would be, "discipline them." This means that God would treat them harshly in order to teach them to stop disobeying Him.
