===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **another week** - Noah waited seven more days for the water to go down before he sent out the dove again
  * **a third time** - (LS. suggest that we change story to say "again" instead of "a third time.")
  * **did not come back** - this time, the dove found enough dry ground and tall enough trees that it chose to stay on the land
