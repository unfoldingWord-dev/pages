====== Adam Alone [01-12] ======


{{:en:obs:obs-01-12.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Then **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** said, "It is **not [[:en:key-terms:good|good]]** for man to be **alone**." But none of the animals could be **[[:en:key-terms:adam|Adam's]] helper**.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **not [[:en:key-terms:good|good]]** - This is the first time that anything in creation was not good. It means it was "not yet good" because God was not finished with the creation of humans.
  * **alone** - Adam was the only human, with no possibility of a relationship with another person, and unable to reproduce children and multiply.
  * **[[:en:key-terms:adam|Adam's]] helper** - There was no one who was similar enough to Adam to join with him to accomplish the task that God gave to him. None of the animals could do this.
