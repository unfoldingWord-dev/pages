After **[[:en:key-terms:elizabeth|Elizabeth]]** gave birth to her baby boy, **they named him** **[[:en:key-terms:john-baptist|John]]** as the **[[:en:key-terms:angel|angel]]** had commanded. Then **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** allowed **[[:en:key-terms:zechariah-nt|Zechariah]]** to speak again. Zechariah said, “**[[:en:key-terms:praise|Praise]] God**, because he has remembered his people! You, my son, **will be called** **the [[:en:key-terms:prophet|prophet]]** of the **Most High God** who will **prepare the way for the [[:en:key-terms:messiah|Messiah]]**!”

//A Bible story from: Luke 1//


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **they named him** - That is, "Zechariah and Elizabeth named the baby."
  * **Praise God** - That is, "We should all praise God."
  * **will be called** - This is another way of saying, “will be” or, “will be known as.” John would actually be the Prophet of the Most High God.
  * **the prophet** - That is, “the very important prophet." John would be the prophet that the Old Testament prophets had predicted would come before the Messiah.
  * **Most High God** - Another way to say this would be, “the God who is greater than everything” or, “the God who rules over everything.”
  * **prepare the way for the Messiah** - That is, “prepare the people to receive the Messiah.”
  * **A Bible story from:** - If all or portions of the Bible have already been translated into your language, check to make sure that these references point to the correct chapters and verses.
