**[[:en:key-terms:god|God]] showed** the **[[:en:key-terms:prophet|prophets]]** many things about the **[[:en:key-terms:messiah|Messiah]]** who would come, but the Messiah had not come yet. More than 400 years after the last of these prophecies was given, **when the time was perfect**, God would send the Messiah **into the world**.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **showed** – That is, “told” or “revealed to.” 
  * **coming Messiah** - That is, "the Messiah who will come."
  * **when the time was perfect** - That is, “at exactly the right time” or “at the exact time God had planned.”   * **into the world** - Jesus already existed as the Son of God, but now he also became human so that he could live among people and fulfill all that the prophet said the Messiah would do.
