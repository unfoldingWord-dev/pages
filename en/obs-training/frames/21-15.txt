====== At the Perfect Time [21-15] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-21-15.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

**[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** showed the **[[:en:key-terms:prophet|prophets]]** many things about the **coming [[:en:key-terms:messiah|Messiah]]**, but the Messiah had not come yet. More than 400 years after the last of these prophecies was given, when the **time was perfect**, God sent the Messiah **into the world**.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **coming Messiah** - That is, "the Messiah who will come."
  * **time was perfect** - That is, "when the time was right" or, "when the conditions were favorable."
  * **into the world** - Jesus already existed as the Son of God, but now he also became human so that he could live among people and fulfill all that the prophet said the Messiah would do.
