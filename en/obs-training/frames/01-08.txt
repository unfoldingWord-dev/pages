On the sixth day of creation, **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** said, "Let there be all kinds of land animals!" And it happened just like **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** said. Some were farm animals, some crawled on the ground, and some were wild. And **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** saw that it was **[[:en:key-terms:good|good]]**.


===== Emphasis: =====


On the fifth day, God created all of the animals that live on the land. This included the wild animals, the animals that are friendly to people, and even the reptiles. God made each one according to their unique, diverse traits. He also saw that this was good and acceptable to His plan and purpose for them.
