====== Israel Believes God [12-12] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-12-12.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

When the Israelites saw that the Egyptians were dead, they believed in God and trusted that Moses was a prophet of God.

(TW the Israelites didn't believe in God unto salvation. Most of them did not trust God in that way, but they knew that God had delivered them from great danger. Should this read, (reading after "dead,")  "they knew that God had brought them out of Egypt, and they were sure that Moses was a prophet of God."?
