Then God appeared to a Christian named Ananias and said, "Go to the house where Saul is staying. Lay your hands on him so that he can see again.” But Ananias said, “Master, I have heard how he has persecuted the Christians.” God said, “I have chosen him to declare my name to the unsaved. I will show him how much he must suffer for my sake."
