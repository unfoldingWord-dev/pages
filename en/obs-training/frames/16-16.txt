They started **[[:en:key-terms:worship|worshiping]]** Gideon's idol. God **[[:en:key-terms:punish|punished]]** **[[:en:key-terms:israel|Israel]]** again **for worshiping idols**. **Their enemies defeated them**. They finally asked God for help again, and God sent them another **deliverer**.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **a foolish thing** - A "foolish" thing is the opposite of a "wise thing." It was very stupid of the people to stop worshiping the God who had miraculously delivered them from their enemies. 
  * **He made an idol out of the gold** – This could be translated as, “He melted down the gold objects the people had given him and formed an idol out of that gold.” 
  * **turned away from God** - This could be translated as, “disobeyed God” or “stopped worshiping God.” 
  * **for worshiping idols** - That is, “because they worshiped idols.”
  * **Their enemies defeated them** - This could be translated as, “God allowed their enemies to defeat them” to make it clear that this was how He was punishing them.
