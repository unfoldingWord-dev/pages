Then **[[:en:key-terms:gideon|Gideon]]** did **a foolish thing**. He made an **[[:en:key-terms:idol|idol]]** with the money, and the people **turned away from [[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** again. They started **[[:en:key-terms:worship|worshiping]]** Gideon's idol. God punished **[[:en:key-terms:israel|Israel]]** again for worshiping idols. Their enemies defeated them. They finally asked God for help, and God sent them another **deliverer**.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **a foolish thing** - A "foolish" thing is the opposite of a "wise thing." It was very stupid of the people to stop worshiping the God who had miraculously delivered them from their enemies. 
  * **turned away from [[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** - That is, they stopped worshiping God and started worshiping idols.
