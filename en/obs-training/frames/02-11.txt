{{:en:obs:obs-02-11.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** said to the man, “You listened to your wife and **[[:en:key-terms:disobey|disobeyed]]** me. Now the **ground is [[:en:key-terms:curse|cursed]]**, and you will need to work hard to grow food. Then **you will [[:en:key-terms:death|die]]**, and your body will **return to dirt**.” The man named his wife **[[:en:key-terms:eve|Eve]], which means “life-giver**,” because she would become the **mother of all people**. And **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** clothed **[[:en:key-terms:adam|Adam]]** and **[[:en:key-terms:eve|Eve]]** with animal skins.


===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **ground is cursed** - As punishment for Adam's disobedience, the earth would no longer be fruitful. Adam would have to work very hard to raise enough food to eat.
    * **you will die** - The ultimate punishment for their disobedience was death. Spiritual death is our separation from God. Physical death is our separation from our body. 
    * **return to dirt** - God created Adam from the dirt or soil and gave him life. As a result of sin, his life will be taken from him and his body will decompose and become dirt again. 
    * **Eve, which means 'life-giver'** - God gave life to Adam and Eve, and it is passed on to every person through childbirth. 
    * **mother of all people** - This means that she would be the female ancestor of all people. Some languages say “she would be the grandmother of all people.”
