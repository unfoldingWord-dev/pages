**[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** said to the man, “You listened to your wife and **[[:en:key-terms:disobey|disobeyed]]** me. Now the ground is **[[:en:key-terms:curse|cursed]]**, and you will need to work hard to grow food. Then you will **[[:en:key-terms:die|die]]**, and your body will return to dirt.” The man named his wife **[[:en:key-terms:eve|Eve]]**, which means “**[[:en:key-terms:life|life]]**,” because she would become the mother of all people. And **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** clothed **[[:en:key-terms:adam|Adam]]** and **[[:en:key-terms:eve|Eve]]** with animal skins.

===== Translation Notes: =====



    * **ground is cursed** - as punishment for his disobedience, the earth would no longer be fruitful. Adam would have to work very hard to raise enough food to eat.
    * **you will die** - The ultimate punishment for their disobedience was death. Spiritual death is our separation from God. Physical death is our separation from our body. 
    * **return to the dirt** - God created Adam from the dirt and gave him life. As a result of sin, our life will be taken from us and we will become dirt again. 
    * **Eve, which means 'life'** - God gave life to Adam and Eve, and it is passed on to every person through childbirth. This life is temporary, however because it is tainted by the sin of Adam and Eve.
    * **mother of all people** - Every person is a direct descendant of Eve.
