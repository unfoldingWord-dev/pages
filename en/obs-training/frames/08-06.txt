Years later, **[[:en:key-terms:joseph|Joseph]]** was still in prison, even though he had done nothing wrong. The king of **[[:en:key-terms:egypt|Egypt]]**, who was called the **[[:en:key-terms:pharaoh|Pharaoh]]**, had two dreams that **disturbed him greatly**. None of **his advisors** could tell him the **meaning of the dreams**.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **disturbed him greatly** – This means that the king felt very afraid and confused (because of what he had seen in the dreams). 
  * **his advisors** - These were men with special powers and knowledge who could sometimes tell what dreams meant. Some translations refer to them as “wise men.” 
  * **meaning of the dreams** - People in Egypt believed that dreams were messages from the gods telling them about what would happen in the future. God used Pharaoh's dreams to tell him what would happen.
