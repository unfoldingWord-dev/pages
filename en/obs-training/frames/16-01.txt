{{:en:obs:obs-16-01.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


After Joshua died, the Israelites disobeyed God and did not drive out the rest of the Canaanites or obey Godâ€™s laws. The Israelites began to worship the Canaanite gods instead of the One True God. The Israelites had no king, so everyone did what they thought was right for them.
