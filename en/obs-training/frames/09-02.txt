====== A New Pharaoh [09-02] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-09-02.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Hundreds of years later, **a different [[:en:key-terms:pharaoh|Pharaoh]]** became the ruler of **[[:en:key-terms:egypt|Egypt]]**. The **[[:en:key-terms:egypt|Egyptians]]** no longer remembered **[[:en:key-terms:joseph|Joseph]]** and all he had done to help them. They became afraid of the **[[:en:key-terms:israel|Israelites]]** because there were so many of them. So the **Egyptians made the Israelites their [[:en:key-terms:servant|slaves]]**.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **a different Pharaoh** – Another way to say this would be, “a different Pharaoh.” This was probably a descendant of a former Pharaoh who had died. "Pharaoh" is an Egyptian word that refers to their king.
  * **Egyptians made the Israelites their slaves** - The Egyptians forced the Israelites to do hard labor against their will and treated them very harshly.
