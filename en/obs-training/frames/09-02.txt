{{:en:obs:obs-09-02.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


After hundreds of years, the number of **[[:en:key-terms:israel|Israelites]]** had become very large. The **[[:en:key-terms:egypt|Egyptians]]** no longer remembered **[[:en:key-terms:joseph|Joseph]]** and all he had done to help them. They became afraid of the Israelites because there were so many of them. So the **[[:en:key-terms:pharaoh|Pharaoh]]** who was ruling Egypt at that time **made the Israelites [[:en:key-terms:servant|slaves]]** to the Egyptians.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **Pharaoh** – “Pharaoh” is an Egyptian word that refers to their king. This Pharaoh was probably the son of a former Pharaoh who had died, who may have been a descendant of the Pharaoh that Joseph knew.
  * **made the Israelites slaves** - That is, "forced the Israelites to do hard labor against their will and treated them very harshly."
