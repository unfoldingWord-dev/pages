{{:en:obs:obs-09-02.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Many years later, a **new [[:en:key-terms:pharaoh|Pharaoh]]** **came to power in [[:en:key-terms:egypt|Egypt]]**. The **[[:en:key-terms:egypt|Egyptians]]** forgot about **[[:en:key-terms:joseph|Joseph]]** and all he had done to help them. They became afraid of the **[[:en:key-terms:israel|Israelites]]** because there were so many of them. So the **[[:en:key-terms:egypt|Egyptians]] made the [[:en:key-terms:israel|Israelites]] their [[:en:key-terms:servant|slaves]]**.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **new Pharaoh** – Another way to say this would be, “a different Pharaoh.” This was probably a descendant of a former Pharaoh who had died. "Pharaoh" is an Egyptian word that refers to their king.
  * **came to power in Egypt** – This means “became the ruler of Egypt.”
  * **Egyptians made the Israelites their slaves** - The Egyptians forced the Israelites to do hard labor against their will and treated them very harshly. This is different from servants who willingly entered into an agreement to serve a master and became like part of the family, even though they received no payment for their services.
