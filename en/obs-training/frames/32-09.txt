====== The Man Was Healed [32-09] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-32-09.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

When the people who took care of the pigs saw **what happened**, they ran into the town and told **everyone** what **[[:en:key-terms:jesus|Jesus]]** had done. The people from the town came and saw the man **who used to have the [[:en:key-terms:demon|demons]]**. He was sitting down, wearing clothes, and acting like a normal person.


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **what happened** - This refers to Jesus sending the demons out of the man into the pigs.
  * **everyone** – This means they told many people, not every person in the town. If this would be misunderstood it could be translated as, “many people in the town.”
  * **who used to have the demons** – That is, “who the demons had lived in” or, “who had been controlled by the evil spirits.”
