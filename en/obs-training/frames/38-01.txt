About three years after **[[:en:key-terms:jesus|Jesus]]** first began **[[:en:key-terms:preach|preaching]]** and teaching publicly, Jesus told his **[[:en:key-terms:disciple|disciples]]** that he wanted to celebrate this Passover with them in **[[:en:key-terms:jerusalem|Jerusalem]]**, and that he would be killed there.
