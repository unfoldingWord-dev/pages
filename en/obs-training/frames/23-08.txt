====== The Shepherds Visited Jesus [23-08] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-23-08.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

**When the [[:en:key-terms:shepherd|shepherds]] arrived** at the place where **[[:en:key-terms:jesus|Jesus]]** was, they found him lying in a feeding trough, just as the **[[:en:key-terms:angel|angel]]** had told them. They were very excited. **[[:en:key-terms:mary|Mary]] was very happy, too**. The shepherds returned to the fields, **[[:en:key-terms:praise|praising]]** **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** for **all they had heard and seen**.


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **When the shepherds arrived** - Bethlehem was a small town, so it is unlikely that there were other babies born that night. The shepherds probably found Jesus very quickly.
  * **Mary was very happy, too.** - Mary would have been very happy that after the lowly circumstances of the birth of Jesus, the angels had testified to the shepherds that he was indeed the Messiah and the Son of God.
  * **all they had heard and seen** - This would include both the angels, and the new baby.
