**When the [[:en:key-terms:shepherd|shepherds]] arrived at the place where [[:en:key-terms:jesus|Jesus]] was, they found** him lying in a feeding trough, just as the **[[:en:key-terms:angel|angel]]** had told them. They were very excited. **[[:en:key-terms:mary|Mary]]** was very happy, too. The shepherds returned **to the fields**, **[[:en:key-terms:praise|praising]]** **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** for **all they had heard and seen**.


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **When the shepherds arrived…they found** – Some languages may have to translate this as, “The shepherds soon arrived…and they found.”
  * **to the fields** – That is, “to the fields where their sheep were.”
  * **all they had heard and seen** - That is, “for everything they had heard and seen.” This included the glorious angels and their amazing message, as well as seeing the newborn Messiah himself.
