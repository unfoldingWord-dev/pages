====== The Snake Is Cursed [02-09] ======


{{:en:obs:obs-02-09.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** said to the snake, “**You are [[:en:key-terms:curse|cursed]]**! You will slide on your belly and eat dirt. You and the woman will **hate each other**, and your children and her children will hate each other, too. The **woman’s [[:en:key-terms:descendant|descendant]]** will **crush your head**, and you will **wound his heel**.”


===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **you are cursed** - This could also be translated as “I curse you” or “Great harm will come to you.” Do not use a word that implies magic.
    * **hate each other** - The woman would hate the snake and the snake would hate the woman. And the women's descendants would hate the snake's descendants, and the snake's descendants would hate them.
    * **woman's descendent** - The term is singular, looking ahead to one particular, special descendent of the woman. The Bible later reveals this person to  be Jesus.
    * **crush your head** - a figure of speech meaning that the descendent of the woman will destroy the snake at a later time. This points to the time when Jesus will destroy Satan.
    * **wound his heel** - a figure of speech meaning that the snake will injure, but not completely destroy the descendent of the woman. This points to the time when Satan will cause Jesus to be killed, but Jesus will live again.
