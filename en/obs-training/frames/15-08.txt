====== Israel Helped the Gibeonites [15-08] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-15-08.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

**[[:en:key-terms:joshua|Joshua]]** gathered the **[[:en:key-terms:israel|Israelite]]** army and they marched all night **to reach the [[:en:key-terms:gibeon|Gibeonites]]**. In the early morning they surprised their **[[:en:key-terms:canaan|Canaanite]] enemies** and attacked them.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **to reach the Gibeonites** - That is, to get to the Gibeonites, or to arrive at where the Gibeonites lived. The Gibeonites lived in Canaan, but Canaan is big enough that it took all night for the Israelite army to travel from their camp to where the Gibeonites were. 
  * **Canaanite enemies** - This refers to the tribe that attacked the Gibeonite tribe.
