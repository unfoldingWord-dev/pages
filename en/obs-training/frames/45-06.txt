===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **guarded the robes** - This could be translated as “watched over the coats.” He was probably making sure they didn't get stolen or damaged. 
  * **stoned Stephen** - That is, "threw stones at Stephen in order to kill him."
  * **were scattered throughout that region** – This could be translated as, “were scattered throughout the regions surrounding Jerusalem” or, “fled from Jerusalem to the nearby regions.” 
  * **But, in spite of this** – The Jewish leaders thought they could stop the spread of Jesus' teaching by persecuting his followers. Instead, this caused them to scatter and spread the message even more widely.
