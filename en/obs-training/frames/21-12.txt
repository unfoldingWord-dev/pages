  * **he would be pierced** - That is, "he would be stabbed." Sharp objects would penetrate his body as part of the punishment for people's sin.


  * **hung on a tree** - This prophetic expression pointed ahead in time to the Messiah being hung from the cross--a frame made from the wood of a tree.
