====== Moses Divided the Sea [12-07] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-12-07.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

**[[:en:key-terms:moses|Moses]] lifted his hand over the sea**, and **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** caused the wind to blow. **The wind made the water in the sea separate** to the left and the right, **making a path** through the sea.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **lifted his hand over the sea** - This could be translated as “raised his hand over the sea” or “held out his hand over the sea”. This was a gesture to show that God was doing this miracle through Moses. 
  * **The wind made the water in the sea separate** – Another way to say this would be, “God used the wind to push the water in the sea…” 
  * **making a path** – Another way to say this would be, “so that a path formed” or "so that a path appeared."
