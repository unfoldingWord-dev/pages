Many **[[:en:key-terms:people-group|people groups]]** still have not heard about **[[:en:key-terms:jesus|Jesus]]**. Before he returned to **[[:en:key-terms:heaven|heaven]]**, Jesus **gave [[:en:key-terms:christian|Christians]] the job of bringing** the **[[:en:key-terms:good-news|Good News]]** to those who have never heard. He said, “Go and **make [[:en:key-terms:disciple|disciples]]** of all people groups! **The fields are ripe for [[:en:key-terms:harvest|harvest]]**!”


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **gave Christians the job of bringing** - That is, "told Christians to bring."
  * **make disciples** - This has the meaning, "help people to become disciples."
  * **The fields are ripe for harvest** - In this metaphor, the "field" is "the world." It means that there are many people in the world who are prepared by God to believe in Jesus and to become disciples. When translating, it would be best to keep the image if it will be understood. If not, you may need explain the image.
