“The weeds represent the people who belong to **the [[:en:key-terms:evil|evil]] one**. The enemy who planted them **is the [[:en:key-terms:satan|devil]]**. **The harvest is the end of the world**, and **the harvesters are the [[:en:key-terms:angel|angels]]**.”


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **the evil one** - This is another title for Satan. It could be translated as, "Satan," but the literal translation provides additional information about his character.
  * **is the devil** - That is, "represents the devil" or, "represents Satan."
  * **The harvest is the end of the world** - That is, "The harvest represents the end of the world." It is the time when all of the people in the world will be collected and appear before God for judgment.
  * **the harvesters are the angels** - That is, "the harvesters represent the angels." They will be the ones who will collect the people for judgment at the end of the world.
