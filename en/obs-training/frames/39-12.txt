The **[[:en:key-terms:rome|Roman]]** soldiers whipped Jesus, put **a royal robe** and a **crown made of thorns** on him. Then they **[[:en:key-terms:mock|mocked]]** him by saying, “**Look**, **the [[:en:key-terms:king-of-jews|King of the Jews]]**!”

//A Bible story from: Matthew 26:57-27:26; Mark 14:53-15:15; Luke 22:54-23:25; John 18:12-19:16//


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **riot** - That is, "start doing violent things in their anger.” 
  * **a royal robe** - That is, “a robe like a king's robe.” This robe had a bright color, so it looked like the kind of robe that a king would wear. 
  * **crown made of thorns** - This means that they tied small branches into a circle to look like a crown. A crown is an ornament that a king wears on his head to show his authority. But the crown that they put on Jesus' head had sharp, dangerous thorns on it. 
  * **Look** – That is, “Look at” or, ”Here is.” 
  * **the King of the Jews** – Since the soldiers were mocking Jesus, this could be translated as, “the so-called King of the Jews.”
