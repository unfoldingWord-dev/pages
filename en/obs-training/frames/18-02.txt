In **[[:en:key-terms:jerusalem|Jerusalem]]**, **[[:en:key-terms:solomon|Solomon]]** built the **[[:en:key-terms:temple|temple]]** for which his father **[[:en:key-terms:david|David]]** had planned and gathered materials. Instead of the **[[:en:key-terms:tent-of-meeting|Tent of Meeting]]**, people now **[[:en:key-terms:worship|worshiped]]** **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** and offered **[[:en:key-terms:sacrifice|sacrifices]]** to him in the Temple. **God came and was present in the Temple, and he lived there** **with his people**.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **God came and was present in the Temple, and he lived there** - This refers to a special sense in which God was in the Temple, even though he was also present everywhere else at the same time. If possible, translate this with a term that does not indicate that he left everywhere else when he came to the Temple.
  * **with his people** - This could be translated as "in the midst of his people" or "among his people."
