{{:en:obs:obs-06-05.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**[[:en:key-terms:isaac|Isaac]]** prayed for **[[:en:key-terms:rebekah|Rebekah]]**, and **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** allowed her to get pregnant with twins. The two **children struggled with each other**, so **[[:en:key-terms:rebekah|Rebekah]]** asked **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** what was happening. 


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **children struggled with each other** - It may be more clear to say, “The two babies struggled with each other while they were still in Rebekah's womb.”
