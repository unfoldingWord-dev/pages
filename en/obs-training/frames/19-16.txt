There were **many other [[:en:key-terms:prophet|prophets]]**. They all told the people to stop **[[:en:key-terms:worship|worshiping]]** **[[:en:key-terms:idol|idols]]** and to **start showing [[:en:key-terms:justice|justice]] and [[:en:key-terms:mercy|mercy]]** to others. The prophets warned the people that if they did not **turn from their [[:en:key-terms:sin|sins]] and start living obedient lives**, then **God’s [[:en:key-terms:judge|judgment]] would come**, and he would **[[:en:key-terms:punish|punish]]** them.
