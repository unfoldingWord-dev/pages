====== The Passover Meal [11-04] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-11-04.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

The **[[:en:key-terms:israel|Israelites]]** did everything just as **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]] had commanded them**. In the middle of the night, God went throughout **[[:en:key-terms:egypt|Egypt]]** killing **every firstborn son**.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **had commanded them** – It may be necessary to say, “had commanded them to do” or, “had told them they must do.” 
  * **every firstborn son** - This means every firstborn son of families who had not made the blood sacrifice, that is, the Egyptians. To make this clear it may be necessary to say, “Every Egyptian firstborn son” (since all the Israelite families had put the blood on their doorposts).
