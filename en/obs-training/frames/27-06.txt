====== The Priest [27-06] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-27-06.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

**“Soon after that**, a **[[:en:key-terms:jew|Jewish]]** **[[:en:key-terms:priest|priest]]** **happened to walk down** that same road. When this **[[:en:key-terms:jewish-leaders|religious leader]]** saw the man who had been robbed and beaten, he moved to the other side of the road, **ignored the man** who needed help, and **kept on going**.”


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **"Soon after that** - Jesus continues to tell the story.
  * **happened to walk down** – That is, “happened to be traveling along.” For some languages it may be necessary to use a word like “travel” rather than “walk” since the priest was not just walking on the road but was traveling to get to another city. 
  * **ignored the man** - That is, “did not help the man” or, “showed no concern for the man.” 
  * **kept on going** - That is, “continued traveling down the road.”
