{{:en:obs:obs-04-01.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**Many years after the flood**, there were **again many people** in the world, and they all spoke the **same language**. But instead of filling the earth as **[[:en:key-terms:God|God]]** had commanded, they gathered together and built **a city**.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **many years after the flood** - Many generations had passed since the end of the flood.
  * **again many people** - Noah's family multiplied into enough people to fill a city.
  * **same language** - This means there was only one language, so they could all understand each other. 
  * **a city** - It is best to use a general word for “city” since the text does not give a specific name.
