**[[:en:key-terms:jesus|Jesus]] answered him** by telling a story. “There was a **[[:en:key-terms:jew|Jewish]]** man who was traveling along the road **from [[:en:key-terms:jerusalem|Jerusalem]] to [[:en:key-terms:jericho|Jericho]]**.”


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * The cloud-like frame around this picture indicates that Jesus is telling a story, and not necessarily explaining a historical event. 
  * **Jesus answered him** - That is, "Jesus answered the law expert."
  * **from Jerusalem to Jericho** – In some languages it may be necessary to say, “from the city of Jerusalem to the city of Jericho” or, “from Jerusalem City to Jericho City.”
