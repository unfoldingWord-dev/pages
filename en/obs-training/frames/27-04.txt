**[[:en:key-terms:jesus|Jesus]] answered him by telling a story**. “There was a **[[:en:key-terms:jew|Jewish]]** man who was traveling along the road **from [[:en:key-terms:jerusalem|Jerusalem]] to [[:en:key-terms:jericho|Jericho]]**.”


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * (//frame of the picture//) - The cloud-like frame around this picture indicates that Jesus is telling a story, and not necessarily explaining a historical event. 
  * **Jesus answered with a story ** - This can also be translated as, "Jesus told a story to answer the lawyer's question."
  * **from Jerusalem to Jericho** – In some languages it may be necessary to say, “from the city of Jerusalem to the city of Jericho” or, “from Jerusalem City to Jericho City.”
