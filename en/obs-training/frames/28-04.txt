====== Sell Everything [28-04] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-28-04.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

**[[:en:key-terms:jesus|Jesus]]** answered, “If **you** want to **be perfect**, then go and sell **everything you own** and give the money to the poor, and you will have **treasure in [[:en:key-terms:heaven|heaven]]**. Then come and follow me.”


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **you** - If your language has different words for 'you' depending on the number of people intended, use the singular form. Jesus was addressing this command to this one man.
  * **be perfect** - That is, "completely righteous."
  * **everything you own** - That  is, "all of your possessions."
  * **treasure** - This could also be translated as, "valuable things."
  * **in heaven** - This could also be translated as, located in heaven when you arrive there." This treasure will exist "there and then," as opposed to the wealth that Jesus asked the young man to give up "here and now."
