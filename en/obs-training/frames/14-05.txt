====== The Bad Report [14-05] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-14-05.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

The twelve men spied on **[[:en:key-terms:canaan|Canaan]]** for forty days and then **they came back**. They told the people, “**The land is very good, and the crops are great**!" But ten of the spies said, "**The cities are very strong**, and the people are giants! If we attack them, **we will surely die**!”


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **they came back** - They returned to where the rest of the Israelites were waiting, just outside the border of Canaan. 
  * **The land is very good and the crops are great** – This part of the report is good. It could be translated as, “The land is very fertile and the crops are plentiful.” This showed that there was an abundance of food available in Canaan. 
  * **The cities are very strong** - The cities had strong walls around them, so it would be very difficult for the Israelites to attack them. 
  * **we will surely die** – It may be more clear to say, “they will certainly defeat us and kill us!”
