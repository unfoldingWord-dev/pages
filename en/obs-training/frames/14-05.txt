====== The Bad Report [14-05] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-14-05.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

The twelve men spied on **[[:en:key-terms:canaan|Canaan]]** for forty days and then they came back. Ten of the spies gave a **bad report**, saying, “**The land is very good, and the crops are great**! But the cities are very strong, and the people are giants! If we attack them, **we will surely die**!”


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **bad report** - explanation
  * **The land is very good and the crops are great** – This part of the report is good. It could be translated as, “The land is very fertile and the crops are plentiful.” This showed that there was an abundance of food available in Canaan. 
  * **we will surely die** – It may be more clear to say, “they will certainly defeat us and kill us!”
