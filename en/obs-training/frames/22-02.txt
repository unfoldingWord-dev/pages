===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **The angel** - This refers to the angel that came to Zechariah on the previous page.
  * **the great prophet** - Malachi had prophesied that a very important prophet would come who would announce the Messiah's coming. The angel was saying that John would be that prophet. 
  * **comes before the Messiah** - The prophet would appear and prophesy before the arrival of the Messiah.
  * **How will I know this will happen?** - Another way to translate this would be, “How can I be sure that this will truly happen?”
