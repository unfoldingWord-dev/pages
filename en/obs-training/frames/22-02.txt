**The [[:en:key-terms:angel|angel]]** said to **[[:en:key-terms:zechariah-nt|Zechariah]]**, “Your wife will have a son. You will name him **[[:en:key-terms:john-baptist|John]]**. He will be filled with the **[[:en:key-terms:holy-spirit|Holy Spirit]]**, and will **prepare the people for the [[:en:key-terms:messiah|Messiah]]**!” Zechariah responded, “My wife and I are too old to have children! How will I know this will happen?”


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **The angel** - This refers to the angel that came to Zechariah on the previous page.
  * **who will come before the Messiah and announce his coming** – Another way to say this would be, “who will announce that the Messiah is coming very soon.” In this context “before” means ahead of him in time. 
  * **How will I know this will happen?** - Another way to translate this would be, “How can I be sure that this will truly happen?”
