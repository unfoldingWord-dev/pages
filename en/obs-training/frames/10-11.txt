Then **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]] sent darkness that lasted for three days**. It was so dark that the **[[:en:key-terms:egypt|Egyptians]]** could not leave their houses. But where the **[[:en:key-terms:israel|Israelites]]** lived, there was light.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **God sent darkness** - God caused darkness to cover or spread over most of Egypt. In other words, God took away the light from this part of Egypt.
  * **darkness that lasted for three days** - This darkness was darker than ordinary nighttime darkness, and it continued to be totally dark for three whole days.
