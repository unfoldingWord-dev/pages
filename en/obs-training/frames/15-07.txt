{{:en:obs:obs-15-07.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

When the other people groups in **[[:en:key-terms:canaan|Canaan]]** heard that the **[[:en:key-terms:gibeon|Gibeonites]]** had made a peace treaty with the **[[:en:key-terms:israel|Israelites]]**, they joined their armies and attacked **[[:en:key-terms:gibeon|Gibeon]]**. The Gibeonites sent a message to **[[:en:key-terms:joshua|Joshua]]** asking for help.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **joined their armies** - That is, they combined their individual armies into one large army.
  * **sent a message to Joshua asking for help** - This could be translated as, “sent word to Joshua asking for help” or “sent some of their people to tell Joshua that they needed the Israelites to help them.”
