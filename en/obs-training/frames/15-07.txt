====== The Gibeonites in Danger [15-07] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-15-07.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

The **[[:en:key-terms:israel|Israelites]]** were angry when they found out that the **[[:en:key-terms:gibeon|Gibeonites]] had tricked them**, but they kept the peace treaty they had made with them because they had promised it before God. Some time later, the kings of another people group in **[[:en:key-terms:canaan|Canaan]]**, the Amorites, heard that the Gibeonites had made a peace treaty with the Israelites, so they **joined their armies** and attacked **[[:en:key-terms:gibeon|Gibeon]]**. The Gibeonites **sent a message to [[:en:key-terms:joshua|Joshua]] asking for help**.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **had tricked them** - This could be translated as, "had deceived them" or "had made them believe a lie." 
  * **joined their armies** - That is, they combined their individual armies into one large army.
  * **sent a message to Joshua asking for help** - This could be translated as, “sent some of their people to tell Joshua that they needed the Israelites to help defend them against their enemies.”
