When **[[:en:key-terms:elizabeth|Elizabeth]]** was **six months pregnant**, the same **[[:en:key-terms:angel|angel]]** appeared to **Elizabeth’s relative**, whose name was **[[:en:key-terms:mary|Mary]]**. She was a **[[:en:key-terms:virgin|virgin]]** and was **engaged** to a man named **[[:en:key-terms:joseph-nt|Joseph]]**. The angel said, “You will become pregnant and give birth to a son. You are to name him **[[:en:key-terms:jesus|Jesus]]** and he will be the **[[:en:key-terms:messiah|Messiah]]**.”


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **six months pregnant** - That is, she had already been pregnant for six months, or she was in the sixth month of her pregnancy.
  * **Elizabeth’s relative** - We don't know the exact relationship, but some languages may require that it be stated. Since Elizabeth was much older than Mary, it might be reasonable to say that Elizabeth was Mary's aunt--the sister of Mary's mother.
  * ** engaged** - That is, she was engaged to be married.
