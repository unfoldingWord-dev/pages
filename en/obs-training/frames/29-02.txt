{{:en:obs:obs-29-02.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

Jesus said, “**The [[:en:key-terms:kingdom-of-god|kingdom of God]] is like** **a [[:en:key-terms:king|king]] who** wanted to **settle accounts with his [[:en:key-terms:servant|servants]]**. One of his servants owed a huge debt worth 200,000 years’ wages.”


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **The kingdom of God is like** - Another way to say this would be, “God's rule over people is like” or, “The way God rules people can be compared to.”
  * **is like a king who** - This could be translated as, “is like the kingdom of a king who” or, “can be compared with the rule of a king who.”
  * **settle accounts with his servants** - That is, “collect the debts his servants owed him” or, “collect the money his servants had borrowed from him.”
