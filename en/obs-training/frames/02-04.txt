The **[[:en:key-terms:snake|snake]]** responded, “That is not **[[:en:key-terms:true|true]]**! You won’t **[[:en:key-terms:die|die]]**. **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** just knows that as soon as you eat it, you will understand things like He does. You will be like **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]**, knowing **[[:en:key-terms:good|good]]** and **[[:en:key-terms:evil|evil]]**.”


=== Translation Notes: ===


    * "//not true//" - This statement openly accuses God of being a liar.
    * "//won't die//" - This statement directly contradicts the clear statement by God that they would die if they ate the fruit
    * "//like God//" - "like God" was intended to sound like an advantage for the woman. However, she would only be "like God" in one additional sense--that she would now understand evil. That was a very negative change.
    * "//knowing good and evil//" - this represents a complete loss of innocence. Before disobeying, they did not even know what sin was. After eating, they will have personally experienced what it is like to disobey God.
