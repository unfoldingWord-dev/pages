The **snake** responded, “That is not **true**! You won’t **die**. **God** just knows that as soon as you eat it, you will understand things like He does. You will be like **God**, knowing **good** and **evil**.”
=== Key Terms: ===


    * **[[:en:key-terms:snake|snake]]** - serpent, reptile, a common description or image for Satan
    * **[[:en:key-terms:true|true]]** - matching or conforming to the reality that is revealed by God
    * **[[:en:key-terms:die|die]]** - to die is to be separated from God and from life on this earth
    * **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** - Almighty, creator, sinless and perfect
    * **[[:en:key-terms:good|good]]** - in agreement with God's character and purposes, to an extra measure
    * **[[:en:key-terms:evil|evil]]** - opposed to God's character and purposes


=== Translation Notes: ===


Pay close attention to …


    * "//not true//" - This statement openly accuses God of being a liar.
    * "//won't die//" - This statement directly contradicts the clear statement by God that they would die if they ate the fruit
    * "//like God//" - "like God" was intended to sound like an advantage for the woman. However, she would only be "like God" in one additional sense--that she would now understand evil. That was a very negative change.
    * "//knowing good and evil//" - this represents a complete loss of innocence. Before disobeying, they did not even know what sin was. After eating, they will have personally experienced what it is like to disobey God.
