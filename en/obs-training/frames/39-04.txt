====== I Am the Son of God [39-04] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-39-04.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

**[[:en:key-terms:jesus|Jesus]]** said, “**I am**, and you will see me **seated with [[:en:key-terms:god|God]] and coming from [[:en:key-terms:heaven|heaven]]**.” The **[[:en:key-terms:priest-high|high priest]]** **tore his clothes in anger** and shouted to the other **[[:en:key-terms:jewish-leaders|religious leaders]]**, “We do not need any more **[[:en:key-terms:witness|witnesses]]**? You have heard him say that he is the **[[:en:key-terms:god-son|Son of God]]**. **What is your [[:en:key-terms:judge|judgment]]**?”


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **I am** - That is, “I am as you said” or, “I am the Messiah and the Son of God.” “I am” is also the name of God (See **[[:en:obs-training:frames:09-14|[09-14]]]**). By saying simply, “I am” Jesus was also saying that he is God. If possible, translate this so that people will see a similarity between Jesus' answer and the name of God. 
  * **seated with God** - This could be translated as, “reigning with God.” God is the ruler over all and sits on his throne. Jesus' sitting next to him shows his authority to rule with the Father.
  * **seated with God and coming from heaven** – This could be translated as, “sitting beside God and then coming from heaven.” 
  * **tore his clothes in anger** - The Jews would tear their clothes to show grief or anger. If tearing the clothes means something else in your language, you may want to substitute a phrase such as, “he was extremely angry.” 
  * **What is your judgment?** - That is, “What is your decision?” or, “Tell us what have you decided: Is he innocent or guilty?” The chief priest wanted the religious leaders to say that Jesus was guilty of lying when he said that he was the Son of God.
