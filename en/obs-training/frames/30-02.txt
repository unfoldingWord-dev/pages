{{:en:obs:obs-30-02.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

But there were many people who saw **[[:en:key-terms:jesus|Jesus]]** and the **[[:en:key-terms:disciple|disciples]]** **leave**. They ran along the shore of the lake to get to the other side ahead of them. When Jesus and the disciples arrived, **they were greeted by great crowds of people**.


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **leave** - Some languages may need to add, "leave in the boat."
  * **they were greeted by great crowds of people** - This could also be translated as, "great crowds of people greeted them" or, "great crowds of people met them there."
