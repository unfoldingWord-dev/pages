Then **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** said, "**Let us** make human beings **in our image** to be **like us**. They will have **authority** over the earth and all the animals."


===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **Let us** - indicates God's deliberate, willful decision to create man in a particular way for a particular purpose. You could translate this as, "We will make...."
    * **us...our...us** - The Bible teaches that there is one God, but the Old Testament word "God" is a plural form, and therefore it uses plural pronouns to refer to God.
    * **in our image** - An image is a physical representation of someone or something. Humans were made in such a way that we display or represent some of the qualities or traits of God.
    * **like us** - Humans share some of God's characteristics, but not all of of His qualities. This phrase should be translated with words that show man is similar to God, but not equal with Him or the same as He is.
    * **authority** - People have the right and power to manage, guide, and control how the earth and the animals will be used.
