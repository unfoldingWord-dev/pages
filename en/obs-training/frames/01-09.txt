Then **God** said, "Let us make human beings in our image to be like us. They will have **authority** over the earth and all the animals."
=== Key Terms: ===


    * **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]**- Almighty, creator, sinless and perfect 
    * **[[:en:key-terms:authority|authority]]**- to rule or have dominion over something else
    * 
=== Translation Notes: ===


Pay close attention to …


    * "//Let us//" - the word "God" is plural, and therefore the pronouns are also plural 
    * "//human beings//" - people, both male and female (LS: moved from KT)
    * "//in our image//" - similar to the God in many aspects–able to think, interact, and communicate 
    * "//authority over the earth and all the animals" //- authority given to us by God is not permission to use the earth or animals as we want. 
    * "//to be like us" - //  human beings are created in the image or likeness of God.
