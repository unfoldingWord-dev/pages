Then **God** said, "Let us make human beings in our image to be like us. They will have **authority** over the earth and all the animals."
=== Key Terms: ===


    * **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]**- Almighty, creator, sinless and perfect (LC: remove capital A on Almighty)
    * **[[:en:key-terms:authority|authority]]**- to rule or have dominion over something else
=== Translation Notes: ===


Pay close attention to …


    * "//Let us//" - the word "God" is plural, and therefore the pronouns are also plural (LS: moved from KT) (perhaps we could say, "God speaks with Kingly authority saying, "Let us make human beings in our likeness." ((the plural can be the Hebrew 'regal ""we'" with no implication of plurality) but it may also point (as Christians know) to God being three Persons." Saying God is "plural" implies that he is several Gods. TW)
    * "//human beings//" - people, both male and female (LS: moved from KT)
    * "//in our image//" - similar to the God in many aspects–able to think, interact, and communicate (LS: moved from KT)
    * "//authority over the earth and all the animals" //- authority given to us by God is not permission to use the earth or animals as we want. There is a responsibility to be good managers of all we have on the earth. God has provided for us through the plants and animals he has made, and we are not to abuse or squander his good gifts. (TW)
    * "//to be like us" - //  human beings are created in the image or likeness of God. We are given many qualities that are also shared with God. God is personal, so are we. God speaks and understands, as we do. God is spiritual and eternal, people have a spiritual life and God made us to live forever (after physical death). Our capacity for relationship with God, to know God and worship him, is our greatest goal and our highest potential. The image of God in man says that there are some qualities in us that we share with God, and that those qualities came to us as gifts from God. He made us to be <font 13px/arial;;#000000;;#ffffff>like him</font> in some wonderful ways. (TW)
