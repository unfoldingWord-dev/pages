====== 01-09. Man in God's Image ======


{{:en:obs:obs-01-09.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Then **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** said, "Let us make human beings in our image to be like us. They will have authority over the earth and all the animals."


===== Emphasis: =====


On the final day of creation, God made the first man. His plan for people was for them to be a higher level of being than the animals, and to rule over them. Furthermore, people would be similar to God in some ways. For example, like God, people have spiritual life, they can have personal relationships, they think and plan and act, and they are capable of moral choices. 


===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **final day** - God created humans on the last day of creation, implying that everything which was created in the previous days was in preparation for us. 
    * **Let us** - indicates a deliberate, willful decision to create man in a particular way for a particular purpose.
    * **us...our...us** - The Bible teaches that there is one God, but the Old Testament word "God" is a plural form, and therefore it uses plural pronouns to refer to God.
    * **human beings** - people, both male and female 
    * **in our image** - sharing similar traits, qualities, or appearance, but not necessarily equal in all respects
    * **like us** - Humans share some of God's characteristics, but not all of of His qualities. This implies that this likeness is beyond qualities that the birds, fish, and animals share. This is most likely a reference to the fact that people are spiritual beings who can know and worship God and grow in relationship to Him. 
    * **authority** - People have the right and power to manage, guide, and control how the earth and the animals will be used. This also elevates the status of humans to the highest place among everything that was created.
