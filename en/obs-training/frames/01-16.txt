====== 01-16. God Rests ======


{{:en:obs:obs-01-16.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


When the seventh day came, **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** had already finished His work. So **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** rested from all He had been doing. He **[[:en:key-terms:bless|blessed]]** the seventh day and made it **[[:en:key-terms:holy|holy]]**, because on this day He rested from His work. This is how **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** created the universe and everything in it.


===== Emphasis: =====


God's work of creation was finished in six days. So on the seventh day, God rested and watched to see what would happen to it. The seventh day was very special to Him because it was the day in which He relaxed and enjoyed His completed creation. So He set that day apart from the others as a day to remember what He had done. That is how God made everything that exists in heaven and earth.


===== Translation Notes: =====


    * "//day//" - a literal 24-hour period
    * "//universe//" - both the heavens and the earth
