{{:en:obs:obs-01-16.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


When the seventh day came, **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** had already finished His work. So **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** rested from all He had been doing. He **[[:en:key-terms:bless|blessed]]** the seventh day and made it **[[:en:key-terms:holy|holy]]**, because on this day He rested from His work. This is how **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** created the universe and everything in it.


===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **seventh day** - the day after the six days of creation were completed
    * **finished His work** - Specifically, God finished the work of creation. He still performs other work.
    * **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]] rested** - God "rested" in the sense that He stopped working because creation was complete. God was not tired, or unable to continue. 
    * **[[:en:key-terms:bless|blessed]] the seventh day** - God had a special, positive plan for the seventh day, and every seventh day to follow.
    * **made it [[:en:key-terms:holy|holy]]** - That is, God "set apart" the day as special day. It was not to be used in the same way as the other six days of the week. It had the unique purpose of reminding people that God completed the creation in six days and then rested.
    * **the universe** - everything that God created on the earth and in/throughout the heavens, both visible and invisible things; the whole world
