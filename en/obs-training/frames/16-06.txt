===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **his father's altar to an idol** - Some languages might need to tell about the altar to an idol first. “Now Gideon's father had an altar dedicated to an idol. God told Gideon to tear down that altar." 
  * **afraid of the people** - That is, the friends and neighbors who worshiped the same idol.
  * **waited until nighttime** - Gideon smashed the idol at night when everyone was asleep so that no one would see him do it.
  * **an altar to God** – It may be more clear to say, “an altar for making sacrifices to God.”
