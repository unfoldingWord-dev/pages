Then the man and his wife heard the sound of **God** walking through the garden. They both hid from **God**. Then **God** called to the man, “Where are you?” **Adam** replied, “I heard you walking in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was **naked**. So I hid.”
=== Key Terms: ===


    * **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** - Almighty, creator, sinless and perfect
    * **[[:en:key-terms:adam|Adam]]** - the first man. Adam's name was literally the Hebrew word for "man"
    * **[[:en:key-terms:naked|naked]]** - not having any clothing or covering


=== Translation Notes: ===


Pay close attention to …


    * "//God walking//" - God apparently appeared in a form that enabled him to "walk" in the garden. He regularly came to the garden to walk and talk with the man and the woman.
    * "//Where are you?//" - God already knew the answer to this question. The purpose of the question is to force the man and the woman to explain why thy were hiding.
