Then the man and his wife heard the sound of **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** walking through the garden. They both hid from **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]**. Then **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** called to the man, “Where are you?” **[[:en:key-terms:adam|Adam]]** replied, “I heard you walking in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked. So I hid.”

===== Translation Notes: =====



    * **God walking** - God apparently appeared in a form that enabled him to "walk" in the garden. He regularly came to the garden to walk and talk with the man and the woman.
    * **Where are you?** - God already knew the answer to this question. The purpose of the question is to force the man and the woman to explain why thy were hiding.
