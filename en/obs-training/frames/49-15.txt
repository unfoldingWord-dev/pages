===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Christian** - This could also be translated as, "believer" or, "disciple." Be careful to choose a word that can refer to everyone who believes in Jesus, not just certain groups. 
  * **Satan's kingdom of darkness** - “Darkness” is used here to refer to sin and everything that is evil. This could be translated as, “Satan's evil rule over people, which is like darkness.” 
  * **God's kingdom of light** - "Light" here refers to God's holiness and goodness. This could be translated as, “God's righteous rule over people, which is like light.” If possible it is important to keep the contrast between darkness and light because this is an important theme in the Bible. 
  * **All the old things are gone, because God makes all things new** - This could also be translated as, “The old, sinful way of life is gone, because God gives us a new, righteous life” or, “God takes away the old, sinful ways of doing things and replaces them with new, righteous ways of doing things.”
