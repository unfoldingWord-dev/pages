If you **[[:en:key-terms:believe|believe]]** in **[[:en:key-terms:jesus|Jesus]]** and what he has done for you, you are a **[[:en:key-terms:christian|Christian]]**! **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** has taken you out of **[[:en:key-terms:satan|Satan's]] [[:en:key-terms:kingdom|kingdom]] of darkness** and put you into **[[:en:key-terms:kingdom-of-god|God’s kingdom]] of light**. **The old, sinful way of life is gone, because God has given us a new, righteous life**.


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Satan's kingdom of darkness** - “Darkness” is used here to refer to sin and everything that is evil. This could be translated as, “Satan's evil rule over people, which is like darkness.” 
  * **God's kingdom of light** - "Light" here refers to God's holiness and goodness. This could be translated as, “God's righteous rule over people, which is like light.” If possible it is important to keep the contrast between darkness and light because this is an important theme in the Bible. 
  * **The old, sinful way of life is gone, because God has given us a new, righteous life** - This could also be translated as, “God has taken away the old, sinful ways of doing things and replaced them with new, righteous ways of doing things.”
