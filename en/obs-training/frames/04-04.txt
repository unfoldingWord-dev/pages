  * **Leave your...family** – God was calling Abram to leave behind most of his relatives. However, God was not telling Abram to abandon the people he was responsible for, including his wife and his nephew. 
  * **the land I will show you** - God did not reveal the location of the land until Abram obeyed and left his own country
  * **make your name great** - Abram's name and reputation would be known by all and viewed positively
  * **all families on earth** - Abram's decision to follow God would affect not only his family, but families from every people group on earth
