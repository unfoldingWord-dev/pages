    * //"the Second Day" //- God accomplishes the work of creation with a series of creation actions, each building on the one before. God's plan was orderly, comprehensive and purposeful. Creation demonstrates the purpose and wisdom of God. The days show not only what God made, but the order in which he made everything. 
    * "//day//" - a literal 24-hour period 
    * "//God spoke//" - God created the sky by means of a simple verbal command 
    * "//sky//" - the space above the earth, including the air we breathe and the heavens
