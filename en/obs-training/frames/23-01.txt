{{:en:obs:obs-23-01.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

**[[:en:key-terms:joseph-nt|Joseph]]** was a **[[:en:key-terms:righteous|righteous]]** man. When he heard that **[[:en:key-terms:mary|Mary]]** was pregnant, **he knew it was not his baby**. He did not want **to shame her**, so **he planned to quietly divorce her**. Before he could do that, an **[[:en:key-terms:angel|angel]]** appeared to him in a **[[:en:key-terms:dream|dream]]**.


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **he knew it was not his baby** -  That is, “he knew that he was not the one who had caused her to be pregnant.” 
  * **to shame her** - to shame her - That is, “to cause her to be publicly disgraced” or “to embarrass her publicly.” Joseph was merciful to Mary, even though it seemed like she was an adulterer. 
  * **he planned to quietly divorce her** - This could also be translated as “He planned to divorce her without telling others why,” or “He planned to divorce her without telling others about her pregnancy.” Because Joseph was righteous, he wanted to resolve the situation in the right way/in the best way possible, and in this culture the best resolution would be to divorce her quietly.
  * **divorce her** - Joseph and Mary were only engaged, but the Jewish marriage customs of that day, required a divorce to end an engagement, as well as a marriage.
