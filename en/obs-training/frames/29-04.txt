“The **[[:en:key-terms:servant|servant]]** **fell on his knees** **before the [[:en:key-terms:king|king]]** and said, ‘Please be patient with me, and **I will pay everything back**.’ The king **felt pity** for the servant and **canceled all of his debt**.”


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **fell on his knees** - That is, “quickly knelt down on the ground”. This was a way to show his humility and his desire for the king to help him. Make sure it doesn't sound like he fell down accidentally.
  * **before the king** - This means, “in front of.”
  * **I will pay everything back** - That is, "I will fully repay the debt to you."
  * **felt pity** - That is, “felt compassion for” or, “felt sorry for”. The king knew that the servant and his family would suffer greatly if they were sold into slavery.
  * **canceled all of his debt** - This can be translated as, “said that the servant did not need to pay back the money he owed the king.”
