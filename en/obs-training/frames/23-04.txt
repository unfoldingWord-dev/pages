**About the time [[:en:key-terms:mary|Mary]] was to give birth**, the **[[:en:key-terms:rome|Roman]] government** told everyone to go to the **town of their ancestors** **for a census**. **[[:en:key-terms:joseph-nt|Joseph]]** and Mary had to make a long journey from where they lived in **[[:en:key-terms:nazareth|Nazareth]]** to **[[:en:key-terms:bethlehem|Bethlehem]]** because their ancestor was **[[:en:key-terms:david|David]]** whose hometown was Bethlehem.


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **About the time Mary was to give birth** - That is, “When it was near the end of Mary's pregnancy.”
  * **Roman government** - Rome had conquered and ruled over Israel at this time.
  * **town of their ancestors** - That is, "the town where their ancestors had lived."
  * **for a census** - That is, “to be counted for the government record” or, “so that the government could write their names on a list.” or “to be counted by the government.” This census was probably made for the purpose of taxing the people.
