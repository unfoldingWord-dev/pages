====== The Treasure in the Field [34-04] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-34-04.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

“The **[[:en:key-terms:kingdom-of-god|kingdom of God]]** is also like **treasure** that someone hid in a field. Another man found the treasure and then **buried it again**. He was so (happy/excited/filled with joy) that he went and sold everything he had and used the money to **buy that field**.”


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * Jesus told another story.
  * **treasure** - That is, "something that was very valuable."
  * **buried it again** - It is also possible to add, "so that no one else would find it."
  * **buy that field** - Some people may want to add, “so that the treasure would be his.” Some may also add, “The kingdom of God is so valuable.”
