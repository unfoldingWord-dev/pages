So **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]**  made **[[:en:key-terms:adam|Adam]]** fall into a deep sleep. Then **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]**  took one of **[[:en:key-terms:adam|Adam's]]** ribs and made it into a woman and brought her to him.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **a deep sleep** - This happened so that the removal of his rib would not be painful
  * **one of [[:en:key-terms:adam|Adam's]] ribs** - God formed Adam from dirt, but He made the woman directly from Adam's own body.
  * **took...and made** - The verbs indicate God's very personal act of removing the rib from Adam and shaping it into a woman. 
  * **a woman** - She was the first woman, but she was also the female version of human beings that was missing until now.
  * **brought her to him** - God personally introduced them. He presented the woman to Adam, almost like offering a special gift.
