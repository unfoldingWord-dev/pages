====== 01-13. Eve Created ======


{{:en:obs:obs-01-13.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


So **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]**  made **[[:en:key-terms:Adam|Adam]]** fall into a deep sleep. Then **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]**  took one of **[[:en:key-terms:Adam|Adam's]]** ribs and made it into a woman and brought her to him.


===== Emphasis: =====


God formed Adam from the dirt as a new kind of creature. But He made the woman directly from Adam. He put Adam to sleep, took one of the ribs from his body, and made the first woman from that rib. She was not a different kind of creature--she was like Adam. Then God presented her to Adam as His final act of creation and provision for him.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * "//one of Adam's ribs//" - Adam was formed from dust, but the woman was formed directly from Adam's own body 
  * "//made//" - God actively "constructed" or "built" the woman from Adam's rib 
  * "//woman//" - a generic term for any adult woman
