The next morning the people saw that the **[[:en:key-terms:altar|altar]]** had been torn down, and they were very angry. They went to **[[:en:key-terms:gideon|Gideon's]]** house to kill him, but Gideon's father said, “Why are you trying to **help your [[:en:key-terms:god-false|god]]**? If he is a god, let him **protect himself**!” **So he [[:en:key-terms:save|saved]] Gideon**.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **that the altar had been torn down** - This could be translated as, “that someone had torn down the altar” or “that someone had taken down the altar and destroyed it.” 
  * **help your god** - In this sense, to avenge the destruction of the idols and to restore worship of the idols.
  * **protect himself** - That is, if the gods were real, they should be able to punish Gideon themselves. 
  * **So he saved Gideon** - This could be translated as, “Because he said this, the people did not kill Gideon.”
