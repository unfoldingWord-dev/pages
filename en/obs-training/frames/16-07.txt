{{:en:obs:obs-16-07.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

The next morning the people saw **that the [[:en:key-terms:altar|altar]] had been torn down**, and they were very angry. They went to **[[:en:key-terms:gideon|Gideon's]]** house to kill him, but Gideon's father said, “Why are you trying to **help your [[:en:key-terms:god-false|god]]**? **If he is a god, let him protect himself**!” **So he [[:en:key-terms:save|saved]] Gideon**.


===== Translation Notes: =====


  * **that the altar had been torn down** - This could be translated as, “that someone had torn down the altar” or “that someone had taken down the altar and destroyed it.” 
  * **Why are you trying to help your god?** - This is not a real question that asks for information. Another way of saying this would be, “You should not be trying to help your god” or, “You should not need to help your god.” 
  * **If he is a god, let him protect himself** - This means, “If he were truly a god, he would be able to defend himself.” 
  * **So he saved Gideon** - This could be translated as, “Because he said this, the people did not kill Gideon.”
