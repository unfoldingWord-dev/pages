Philip, one of Jesus' disciples, went to Samaria where he preached about Jesus and many were saved. Then one day an angel from God told Philip to go to the road to Gaza in the desert. As he walked along the road, Philip saw an important official from Ethiopia riding in his chariot. The Holy Spirit told Philip to go up and talk to this man.
