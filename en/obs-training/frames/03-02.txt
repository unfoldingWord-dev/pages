  * "//found grace//" - God chose to deal kindly with Noah even though Noah was not sinless. 
  * "//God's eyes//" - a figure of speech meaning that God was aware of Noah's righteous actions
  * "//flood//" - the huge flood that would cover the entire world
  * "//planning to send//" - God told Noah about the flood many years before it happened so he would have enough time to build the ark
