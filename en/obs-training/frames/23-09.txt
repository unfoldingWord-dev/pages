{{:en:obs:obs-23-09.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

**Some time later**, **[[:en:key-terms:wise|wise]]** men from countries far to the east saw an **unusual star** in the sky. **They realized it meant a new [[:en:key-terms:king-of-jews|king of the Jews]] was born**. So, they traveled a great distance to see this king. They came to **[[:en:key-terms:bethlehem|Bethlehem]]** and found **the place where [[:en:key-terms:jesus|Jesus]] was living**.


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Some time later** - We are not sure how long it was after the birth of Jesus before they saw the star, but it may have taken as long as two years for them to prepare and travel to Bethlehem.
  * **unusual star** - The star that they noticed was not normal star. It was something that appeared at the time of Jesus' birth.
  * **They realized it meant a new king of the Jews was born** - These men were probably astrologers who studied the stars. However, they may have had access to the writing of the prophets who predicted the birth of the Messiah.
  * **the place where Jesus was living** - When these men arrived, Joseph and Mary were still in Bethlehem, but probably living in a house.
