====== The Wise Men Visited Jesus [23-09] ======

{{:en:obs:obs-23-09.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

**Some time later**, **[[:en:key-terms:wise|wise]]** men from countries far to the east saw an **unusual star** in the sky. **They realized it meant a new [[:en:key-terms:king-of-jews|king of the Jews]] had been born**. So, they traveled a great distance to see this king. They came to **[[:en:key-terms:bethlehem|Bethlehem]]** and found **the place where [[:en:key-terms:jesus|Jesus]] was living**.


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Some time later** - This could be translated as, “Months later” or “Over a year later.” It is not clear how long it was after the birth of Jesus before the wise men saw the star, but it may have taken as long as two years for them to prepare for the trip and then travel to Bethlehem.
  * **unusual star** - The star that they noticed was not a normal star. It was something that appeared at the time of Jesus' birth.
  * **They realized it meant a new king of the Jews was born** - It may be necessary to add, “From their studies, these scholars realized…” The “wise men” were probably astrologers who studied the stars. They may also have had access to the Old Testament prophets' writings that predicted the birth of the Messiah.
  * **the place where Jesus was living** - That is, “the house where Jesus and his parents were staying.” They were no longer in the place for animals where he was born.
