====== How to Get Started ======


Translating content in Door43 is easy! Follow these simple steps to get started:


===== 1. Create an Account & Log into Door43 =====


To start translating content, you will need a user account on Door43. If you do not have an account, [[:en:get-started?do=register|create one]] then you can [[https://door43.org/en/obs-training/get-started?do=login&sectok=ee4e19eb537ef77891aa5a6b54b7b2a4|login]].\\ 
You can watch this [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2tx0N-RI_4&feature=youtu.be|video]] to see how to set up an account.


===== 2. Practice Editing a Page =====


Door43 has a [[:playground:playground|test page]] that you can freely edit to try things out.  [[http://youtu.be/dF7px5U6PdA|Here]] is a short video on how to switch between the text editor and the graphical editor.

**Graphical Editor** – When you click the "Edit this page" button, you will probably see an edit window that looks like a simplified word processor.  Click [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbnGtWp0kLc|here]] for the "how to" video. The buttons take care of formatting text and generally make it easier to use. Here is information on the toolbar icons: [[doku>toolbar|quickbuttons]].


**Text Editor** – If you prefer, you can click the "DW Edit" button beneath the edit box to switch to a text-based editor. This is the standard DokuWiki editor and it provides full control over the syntax of the text. Go to the [[:en:obs-training:syntax|Formatting Text]] page for some simple editing formats to use the text editor.


//Note: when using the text editor, you can switch back to the graphical editor by clicking the "FCK Edit" button.// 
===== 3. Choose a Story =====


Browse to a story you would like to translate. For instance, to translate the first story of [[:en:obs|Open Bible Stories]], you would click [[:en:obs:01-the-creation|1. The ]][[:en:obs:01-the-creation|Creation]]from the left menu.


===== 4. Choose a Language =====


In the sidebar, you should see a language selection dropdown. When you click it, you will see a list of available languages, sorted by [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639|language code]]. If you see the language into which you would like to translate, click it.((If you need a language added to Door43, please  [[http://distantshoresmedia/contact|contact us]])) 


**Source Text** – If the language you select does not have a source text already available on the page, you will see a header on the page that says "This page does not exist yet". You can save some time by starting with a source text from another language. Here's how:


    - Click the back button in your browser to return to the same page in the previous language.
    - Click the "Edit this page" button (or "View the page source").
    - Select all the text in the editing window.
    - Copy the text (Control-C).
    - Click the "Cancel" button to leave the edit box and return to the page view.
    - Choose your desired language in the language selection dropdown.
    - Click "Create this page".
    - Click on the DWEdit button. If the window refreshes, click on "Create this page".
    - Paste the contents of the original page into the edit box.
    - Click the "Save" button. The edit window closes and the new created page shows.


===== 5. Start Translating =====


Simply begin translating the source text into the language you selected.
