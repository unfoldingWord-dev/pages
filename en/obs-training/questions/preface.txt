====== Checking the Translation ======

//Preface to the Questions...//

**Comprehension (Testing) Questions and Answers**

In this section are a series of questions that the translation team can use to check their translation of the Open Bible Stories with members of the language community. The purpose of these questions is to make sure that the translation clearly communicates the meaning of the stories. To use these questions, follow this process:

  - 	Someone reads one of the Open Bible Stories to one or more members of the language community who will answer the questions. These members of the language community must be people //who have not been involved in the translation//. In other words, the community members who are asked the questions should not already know the answers to the questions from working on the translation or from previous knowledge of the Bible. We want them to be able to answer the questions only from hearing or reading the Open Bible Stories.
  - 	A member of the translation team asks the community members some of the questions for that story, one question at a time. It is not necessary to use all of the questions for each story if it seems that the community members are understanding the translation well.
  - 	After each question, a member of the language community answers the question. 
  - 	A member of the translation team writes down the answer that the person gives. If the person’s answer is similar to the suggested answer that has been provided for the question, then the translation of the story is clearly communicating the right information at that point. The answer does not have to be exactly the same as the suggested answer to be a right answer, but it should give basically the same information. 
  - 	If the answer is unexpected or very different than the suggested answer, or if the person cannot answer the question, then the translation team will need to revise the translation of the part of the story that communicates that information so that it communicates the information more clearly.
  - 	After the translation team has revised the translation of the story, they should repeat this process with other members of the language community, that is, with speakers of the language who have not been involved in checking the same story before. They should repeat this process with each story until members of the language community can answer the questions well, showing that the translation is communicating the right information clearly.

**Accuracy (Checking) Questions and Answers**

In this section are a series of questions that a group of pastors, elders, or church leaders can use to check the translation of the Open Bible Stories with the translation team. We will call this group of people the checkers. The people who are checkers should be speakers of the language of the translation, be respected in the community, and, if possible, know the Bible well in the language of wider communication. The purpose of these questions is to make sure that the translation accurately communicates the meaning of the original story, and of the Bible. The checkers can ask the translation team members these questions to help them think about the best way to translate the meaning of the stories in their own language. The checkers will also want to ask other questions than these, because they will think of things that are important about the way that they say things in their language that we do not know about. To use these questions, follow this process:

1.	Each of the checkers will read the translation by himself, comparing it to the original Bible story in the language of wider communication. As the checker reads the translation and compares it to the original, he should keep in mind these general questions: 

  * Does the translation add anything to the original meaning?
  * Is there any part of the meaning that is left out of the translation?
  * Has the translation changed the meaning in any way?

2.	The checker will make notes where he thinks there might be a problem or something to be improved.

3.	After the checkers have done this individually, they will meet with the translation committee and review the story or Bible passage together. As they come to the places where each checker made note of a problem or question, the checkers can ask their questions or make suggestions for improvement. Often different checkers will notice the same things, but they will also notice different things. As the checkers and the translation committee discuss the questions and suggestions, they might think of other questions or new ways of saying things. This is good. As the checkers and the translation committee work together, God will help them discover the best way to communicate the meaning of the stories.

4.	After the checkers and the translation committee have decided what they need to change, the translation committee will revise the translation.

5.	After the translation committee revises the translation, they should test the new parts of the translation with the language community again. This process of testing and revision should repeat until the translation communicates clearly and naturally in their language.


**Notes:**

1. As part of building the process into the website, it would be helpful if we could provide a space for the recording of the answers given to the questions. This would make it easier for the questioner to keep track of what answers he received to which questions at different stages of the process. For example, there could be a page for each checking session where they could record the answers to each question in that session. Then they could look back at that page when doing the revision and know what needs to be changed in the translation and why.

2. That leads into this next point: We need to tie the questions to the frames, so the MTT will know which frame needs revision based on the answers received to any certain question. This will save them time from hunting around for the frame that may have the content that was addressed and will reduce errors due to revising the wrong frame.
