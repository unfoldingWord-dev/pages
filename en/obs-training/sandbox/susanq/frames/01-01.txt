====== Susans The Beginning [01-01] ======


{{:en:obs:obs-01-01.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


This is how the beginning of everything happened. **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** created the heavens and the earth and everything in them in six days. At first, the earth was dark and empty, and nothing had been formed in it; there was only water covering it. But **[[:en:key-terms:holy-spirit|God's Spirit]]** was moving over the water.


===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **the beginning**  - That is, "the beginning of all things," before anything existed except God
    * **created**  - Here used in the sense of making something out of nothing
    * **heavens**  - Everything that God created above the earth, including the sun, moon and far-off stars.
    * **earth**  - This refers to the entire planet or world that people live on. More than just the soil.
    * **at first**  - Another way to say this would be, “Before God created anything on the earth, it was….”
    * **dark**  - It was completely dark. There was no light at all, since God had not yet created light.
    * **empty**  - God had not yet created anything except for the bare earth covered by water.
    * **nothing had been formed**- There were no distinguishing features–just water covering everything.
    * **[[:en:key-terms:holy-spirit|God's Spirit]]**- The Spirit of God, sometimes called the Holy Spirit, was present in the beginning, moving freely over the earth in order to create all that He had planned to do.
