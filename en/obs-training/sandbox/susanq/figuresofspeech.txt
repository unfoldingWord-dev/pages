===== Tips for Translation ===== 
    * Sometimes when people in the Bible used a figure of speech, the people who heard it understood what the figure of speech meant, and sometimes they did not understand. Try to translate the figure of speech so that people who read your translation will understand it the same way that the original audience understood it.
