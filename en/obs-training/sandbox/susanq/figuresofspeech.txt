====== Figures of Speech ======


Figures of speech are words and phrases used intentionally to heighten the effect of what a person is saying. In many figures of speech, the words and phrases are not intended to be understood literally. Here are some examples.


Metonymy: a word used is somehow connected to the thing it refers to.


"To shed blood" here means to kill people.


Synecdochy: the word used refers to only a part of the whole thing


<font 13px/arial;;#000000;;#ffffff>Their feet are swift to shed blood. The word 'feet' is used refer to a certain group of people.</font>


Personification: an abstract idea or something which is not alive is treated or spoken of as though it were a person.


My word that goes out from my mouth will not return to me empty but will accomplish what I desire: "My word" is used to refer to what God says. It is personified when it is compared to a servant that goes out and accomplishes the task God sent it to do.


Simile: a comparison


His head and his hair were has white wool, white as snow


Metaphor:


The tongue is a fire. Here the word tongue is used to refer to what people say. It is described as a fire, because like fire, what people say can be very destructive and can spread.
