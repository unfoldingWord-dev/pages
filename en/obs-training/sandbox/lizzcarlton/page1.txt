====== How to Translate Names ======

===== Spell names consistently throughout the Bible: =====

==== For example, the way "Adam," "Eve," "Noah," "Abraham" and other names are spelled in the Old Testament should be the same way their names are spelled in the New Testament. ====

==== Use only letters that are in the language. ====


For most names, it is best to only use letters that are used in the language the Bible is being translated into. For example, for a certain language the name "Eve" might be spelled "Awa" if "e" and "v" do not exist in that language.

===== Options: =====


Some translation teams will choose to spell names as closely as possible to the way those names are spelled in a Bible translation of a nearby widely known language. Other teams may want to spell the names in a way that is similar to the way they are written in the Hebrew (Old Testament) and Greek (New Testament) languages. Sometimes translators will use a name that has the same meaning as the name in the original language.
