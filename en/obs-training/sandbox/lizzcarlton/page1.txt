====== How to Translate Names ======

===== Spell names consistently throughout the Bible: =====


For example, the way that names such as "Adam," "Eve," "Noah," "Abraham" and other names are spelled in the Old Testament should be the same as the way they are spelled in the New Testament.

===== Use only letters that are in the target language: =====


For most names, it is best to only use letters that occur in the language the Bible is being translated into. For example, for a certain language the name "Eve" might be spelled "Awa" if "e" and "v" do not exist in that language.

Other teams may want to spell names in a way that is similar to the way they are written in the original Bible languages. Sometimes</font> translators may decide to use a name that has the same meaning as the name in the original language.
