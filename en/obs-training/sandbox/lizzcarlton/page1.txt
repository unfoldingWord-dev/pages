====== How to Translate Names ======

===== Spell names consistently throughout the Bible: =====


For example, the way that names such as "Adam," "Eve," "Noah," "Abraham" and other names are spelled in the Old Testament should be the same as the way they are spelled in the New Testament.

===== Use only letters that are in the target language: =====


For most names, it is best to only use letters that occur in the language the Bible is being translated into. For example, for a certain language the name "Eve" might be spelled "Awa" if "e" and "v" do not exist in that language. In some languages names have a certain expected form, so it may be necessary in a translation to spell the names so that they look and sound like names naturally do in those languages.

<font 13px/arial;;#000000;;#ffffff>Some translation teams will choose to spell names as closely as possible to the way those names are spelled in the Bible stories or translation of a nearby widely known language. Other teams may want to spell names in a way that is similar to the way they are written in the original Bible languages. However, if spelling a name similarly to the way it is spelled in another language would give a wrong meaning in your language, it is important to change the spelling enough so that it doesn't cause this confusion. Occasionally translators may decide to use a name that has the same meaning as the name in the original language, especially in those places in the Bible text where the meaning of the name is given.
