{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-22-01.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=580b51?nolink&640x360}}


In the past, **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]]** had spoken to **his people** through his **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/angel|angels]]** and **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/prophet|prophets]]**. But then **400 years went by when he did not speak to them**. Suddenly an angel came with a message from God to an old **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/priest|priest]]** named **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/zechariah-nt|Zechariah]]**. Zechariah and his wife, Elizabeth, were **godly people**, but she had not been able to have any children.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**his people**  - This could be translated as, “his people, the Israelites” or “his people, the Jews.” But only include the added information if it is not clearly understood who these people were.
    * 


**400 years went by**  - Another way to say this would be, “400 years passed” or “there were 400 years.” 400 years had passed since the last Old Testament prophet, Malachi.
    * 


**when he did not speak to them**  – That is, “during which God did not give any messages to the prophets for his people.”
    * 


**godly people**  - That is, “people who obeyed God.”

{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-22-02.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=bae93d?nolink&640x360}}


**The [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/angel|angel]]** said to **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/zechariah-nt|Zechariah]]**, “Your wife will have a son. You will name him **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/john-baptist|John]]**. He will be **filled with the [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/holy-spirit|Holy Spirit]]**, and will **prepare the people for the [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/messiah|Messiah]]**!” Zechariah responded, “My wife and I are too old to have children! How will I know this will happen?”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**The angel**  - This refers to the angel that came to Zechariah in **[[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/sandbox/larrysallee/obs-training-text-and-notes#plugin_include__en__obs-training__frames__22-01|[22-01]]]**.
    * 


**filled with the Holy Spirit**  - That is, “controlled by the Holy Spirit” or, “given wisdom and power by the Holy Spirit.”
    * 


**How will I know this will happen?**  - Another way to translate this would be, “How can I be sure that this will truly happen?”

===== Unable to Speak [22-03] =====


{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-22-03.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=52776e?nolink&640x360}}


The **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/angel|angel]]** responded to Zechariah, “I was sent by **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]]** to bring you this good news. Because you did not **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/believe|believe]]** me, you will not be able to speak until the child is born.” Immediately, **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/zechariah-nt|Zechariah]]** was unable to speak. Then the angel left Zechariah. After this, Zechariah returned home and his wife **became pregnant**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**became pregnant**  - Some languages have polite ways of saying “become pregnant.” Use an expression that will not be embarrassing to readers.

===== An Angel Spoke to Mary [22-04] =====


{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-22-04.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=6e0107?nolink&640x360}}


When **Elizabeth**  was **six months pregnant**, the same **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/angel|angel]]** suddenly appeared to **Elizabeth’s relative**, whose name was **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/mary|Mary]]**. She was a **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/virgin|virgin]]** and **was engaged**  to be married to a man named **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/joseph-nt|Joseph]]**. The angel said, “You will become pregnant and give birth to a son. You are to name him **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/jesus|Jesus]]** and he will be the **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/messiah|Messiah]]**.”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**six months pregnant**  - Either she had already been pregnant for six months or she was in the sixth month of her pregnancy.
    * 


**pregnant**  - Different languages have different idioms to talk about pregnancy, such as “she was with child” or, “she had one in her body” or, “she had belly.” Some languages have special ways of speaking about it politely, such as “she was expecting.” Use an expression that will not be embarrassing to readers.
    * 


**Elizabeth**  - She was Zechariah's wife. An angel told Zechariah that Elizabeth would give birth to a son.
    * 


**Elizabeth’s relative**  - Many translations say, “cousin” here but we don't know exactly how these two women were related. A general term like, “relative,” “kin” or, “cousin” could be used.
    * 


**was engaged**  - That is, “was promised.”

===== The Mother of the Messiah [22-05] =====


{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-22-05.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=974ec0?nolink&640x360}}


**[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/mary|Mary]]** replied, “**How can this be**, since I am a **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/virgin|virgin]]**?” The **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/angel|angel]]** explained, “The **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/holy-spirit|Holy Spirit]]** will **come to you, and the [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/power|power]] of [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]] will overshadow you**. So the baby will be **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/holy|holy]]**, the **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god-son|Son of God]]**.” Mary **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/believe|believed]]** and accepted what the angel said.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**How can this be**  - That is, “How can I become pregnant?” Mary was not doubting the truth of the angel's words, but asking how it would happen.
    * 


**Holy Spirit will come to you, and the power of God will overshadow you**  - These are two ways of saying the same thing: “By the power of God, the Holy Spirit will miraculously cause you to become pregnant.” Make sure the translation of this sentence does not sound like there was any physical contact involved. This was a miracle.

Soon after the **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/angel|angel]]** spoke to **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/mary|Mary]]**, she went and visited **Elizabeth**. **As soon as Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting**, Elizabeth’s **baby jumped inside her**. The women rejoiced together about **what [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]] had done for them**. After Mary visited Elizabeth for three months, Mary returned home.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**Elizabeth**  - See the note about Elizabeth on **[[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/sandbox/larrysallee/obs-training-text-and-notes#plugin_include__en__obs-training__frames__22-05|[22-04]]]**.

    * 


**baby jumped inside her**  - The baby moved suddenly inside Elizabeth's womb in response to Mary's greeting to Elizabeth.
    * 


**what God had done for them**  - This refers to the fact that both women were pregnant through God's supernatural intervention. Mary had conceived without a man, and Elizabeth had conceived with Zechariah after she was past the age of childbearing.

{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-22-07.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=60a8f5?nolink&640x360}}


After **Elizabeth**  gave birth to her baby boy, **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/zechariah-nt|Zechariah]]** and Elizabeth named the baby **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/john-baptist|John]]**, as the **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/angel|angel]]** had commanded. Then **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]]** allowed **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/zechariah-nt|Zechariah]]** to speak again. Zechariah said, “**[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/praise|Praise]] God**, because he has remembered his people! You, my son, **will be called**  **the [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/prophet|prophet]]** of the **Most High God**  who will prepare the people to receive the **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/messiah|Messiah]]**!”

**Elizabeth**  - See the note about Elizabeth on **[[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/sandbox/larrysallee/obs-training-text-and-notes#plugin_include__en__obs-training__frames__22-05|[22-04]]]**.
    * 


**Praise God**  - That is, “We should all praise God.”
    * 


**will be called**  - This is another way of saying, “will be” or, “will be known as.” John would actually be the Prophet of the Most High God.
    * 


**the prophet**  - That is, “the very important prophet.” John would be the prophet that the Old Testament prophets had predicted would come before the Messiah.
    * 


**Most High God**  - Another way to say this would be, “the God who is greater than everything” or, “the God who rules over everything.”
    * 


//A Bible story from//  - These references may be slightly different in some Bible translations.

===== Mary Was Pregnant [23-01] =====


{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-23-01.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=6fec5f?nolink&640x360}}


**[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/mary|Mary]]** was engaged to a **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/righteous|righteous]]** man named **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/joseph-nt|Joseph]]**. When he heard that Mary was pregnant, **he knew it was not his baby**. He did not want **to shame Mary**, so **he planned to quietly divorce her**. Before he could do that, an **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/angel|angel]]** came and spoke to him **in a [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/dream|dream]]**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**he knew it was not his baby**  - That is, “he knew that he was not the one who had caused her to be pregnant.”
    * 


**to shame Mary**  - That is, “to cause Mary to be publicly disgraced” or “to embarrass Mary publicly.” Joseph was merciful to Mary, even though it seemed like she was an adulterer.
    * 


**he planned to quietly divorce her**  - This could also be translated as, “He planned to divorce her without telling others why,” or, “He planned to divorce her without telling others about her pregnancy.” Because Joseph was righteous, he wanted to resolve the situation in the best way possible, which in this culture would be to divorce her quietly.
    * 


**divorce her**  - For some languages it may be better to say, “break their engagement.” Joseph and Mary were engaged or, “pledged to be married.” But in Jewish culture a divorce was required in order to break off an engagement.
    * 


**in a dream**  – That is, “while he was asleep and dreaming.”

==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**he did not sleep with her**  - That is, “he did not have sexual relations with her.” He kept her a virgin until the birth of the baby.

{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-23-04.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=9840f8?nolink&640x360}}


**When the time was near for [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/mary|Mary]] to give birth**, the **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/rome|Roman]] government**told everyone to go **for a census**  to the town where their ancestors had lived. **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/joseph-nt|Joseph]]** and Mary had to make a long journey from where they lived in **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/nazareth|Nazareth]]** to **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/bethlehem|Bethlehem]]** because their ancestor was **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/david|David]]** whose hometown was Bethlehem.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**When the time was near for Mary to give birth**  - That is, “When it was near the end of Mary's pregnancy.”
    * 


**Roman government**  - Rome had conquered and ruled over Israel at this time.
    * 


**for a census**  - That is, “to be counted for the government record” or, “so that the government could write their names on a list” or, “to be counted by the government.” This census was probably made for the purpose of taxing the people.

When they arrived in **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/bethlehem|Bethlehem]]**, there was **no place to stay**. The only room they could find was a **place where animals stayed**. The baby was born there and his mother laid him in a **feeding trough**, since they did not have a bed for him. They named him **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/jesus|Jesus]]**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**no place to stay**  - That is, “no usual place to stay.” Because Bethlehem was so crowded at that time, the usual rooms for guests were already full of people.
    * 


**place where animals stayed**  - This was a place for sheltering animals, not a place where people lived. Translate this with a term that would normally be used for a place where animals were kept.
    * 


**feeding trough**  - That is, “animal feed box” or, “wooden or stone box for feeding animals.” The box could have been filled with hay to provide a padded surface for the baby to lie on.

==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**guarding their flocks**  - A “flock” is a group of sheep. The shepherds were caring for their sheep, and protecting them from harm or theft.
    * 


**a shining angel**  - This could also be translated as, “an angel surrounded by a bright light.” The shining light would have seemed even brighter in contrast to the darkness of the night.
    * 


**they were terrified**  - The appearance of the supernatural angel was extremely frightening.
    * 


**Do not be afraid**  - This often means, “stop being afraid.” The shepherds were very afraid when they saw the angel so he was telling them they did not need to be afraid.

**all they had heard and seen**  - That is, “for everything they had heard and seen.” This included the glorious angels and their amazing message, as well as seeing the newborn Messiah himself.

===== The Wise Men Visited Jesus [23-09] =====


{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-23-09.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=d9bb69?nolink&640x360}}


**Sometime later**, **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/wise|wise]] men**from countries far to the east saw an **unusual star**  in the sky. **They realized**  it meant a new **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/king-of-jews|king of the Jews]]** had been born. So, they traveled a great distance to see this king. They came to **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/bethlehem|Bethlehem]]** and found **the house**  where **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/jesus|Jesus]]** and his parents were staying.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**Sometime later**  - It is not clear how long it was after the birth of Jesus before the wise men saw the star, but it may have taken as long as two years for them to prepare for the trip and then travel to Bethlehem.
    * 


**wise men**  - The “wise men” were probably astrologers who studied the stars. They may also have had access to the Old Testament prophets' writings that predicted the birth of the Messiah.
    * 


**unusual star**  - The star that they noticed was not a normal star. It was something that appeared at the time of Jesus' birth.
    * 


**They realized**  - Some languages may add, “From their studies, these scholars realized.”
    * 


**the house**  - They were no longer staying in the place for animals where he was born.

{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-23-10.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=01995c?nolink&640x360}}


When the **wise men**  saw **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/jesus|Jesus]]** with his mother, they **bowed down**  and **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/worship|worshiped]]** him. They gave Jesus **expensive**  gifts. Then they returned home.

    * 


**bowed down**  - That is, “bowed low to the ground.” At that time, this was the customary way of showing great respect or reverence.
    * 


**expensive**  – That is, “very valuable.”

===== John the Prophet [24-01] =====


{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-24-01.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=f47d22?nolink&640x360}}


**[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/john-baptist|John]]**, the son of **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/zechariah-nt|Zechariah]]** and Elizabeth, grew up and became a **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/prophet|prophet]]**. He lived in the **wilderness**, ate **wild honey**  and **locusts**, and wore **clothes made from camel hair**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**wilderness**  - That is, “the desert” or, “a remote, desert-like place.” There were few people living out in this area.
    * 


**wild honey**  - This honey was the natural product of bees in the wilderness; it was not cultivated by people. If that is what people would understand by the word “honey,” you may not need to call it “wild.”
    * 


**locusts**  - These were large, hopping insects with wings, like very large grasshoppers. Some people who live in the desert eat them.
    * 


**camel hair**  - A camel is an animal that has very rough hair. People could make clothing out of it. This could be translated as “rough animal hair.”
    * 


**clothes made from camel hair**  - That is, “coarse clothes made of camel hair.” These clothes would not quickly wear out in the wilderness as other clothes would.

{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-24-02.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=e30743?nolink&640x360}}


Many people came out to the **wilderness**  to listen to **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/john-baptist|John]]**. He **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/preach|preached]]** to them, saying, “**[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/repent|Repent]]**, for **the [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/kingdom-of-god|kingdom of God]] is near**!”


==== Translation Notes: ====

**wilderness**  - See how you translated this word in **[[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/sandbox/larrysallee/obs-training-text-and-notes#plugin_include__en__obs-training__frames__24-01|[24-01]]]**.
    * 


**Repent**  - It might be better to say, “Repent from your sins.”
    * 


**the kingdom of God is near**  - That is, “the kingdom of God is ready to appear” or, “the kingdom of God will arrive soon.” This refers to God's ruling over people. This can also be translated as, “God's reign is about to begin” or, “God will soon rule over us as king.”

===== A Baptism of Repentance [24-03] =====


{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-24-03.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=5ed13b?nolink&640x360}}


When people heard **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/john-baptist|John's]]** message, many of them **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/repent|repented]] from their [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/sin|sins]]**, and John **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/baptize|baptized]]** them. Many **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/jewish-leaders|religious leaders]]** also came to be baptized by John, but they **did not repent**  or **confess their sins**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**repented from their sins**  - This could also be translated as, “repented concerning their sins” or, “changed their minds about their sins” or, “turned away from their sins.”
    * 


**did not repent**  - That is, “did not turn away from their sins.”
    * 


**confess their sins**  - To confess is to acknowledge that something is true. These leaders did not want to acknowledge that they had sinned. This may be translated as, “confess that they had sinned.”

===== Preparing the Way [24-04] =====


{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-24-04.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=fa4917?nolink&640x360}}


**[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/john-baptist|John]]** said to the **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/jewish-leaders|religious leaders]]**, “**You poisonous snakes**! **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/repent|Repent]]** and change your behavior. **Every tree that does not bear good fruit**  **will be cut down and thrown into the fire**.” **John [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/fulfill|fulfilled]]** what the **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/prophet|prophets]]** said, “**See**, I send **my messenger**  **ahead of you**, who will **prepare your way**.”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**You poisonous snakes**  - This could be translated as, “You are like lying poisonous snakes!” John was calling them poisonous snakes because they were dangerous and deceptive.
    * 


**Every tree that does not bear good fruit**  - John is not really talking about trees. This is an expression that compares good fruit to good actions and attitudes that come from God.
    * 


**will be cut down and thrown into the fire**  – This means, “will be judged and punished by God.”
    * 


**John fulfilled**  - That is, “John was doing” what the prophet said God's messenger would do.
    * 


**See**  - This could be translated as “Look and see” or, “Pay attention!”
    * 


**my messenger**  - That is, “I, Yahweh, will send my messenger.” In some languages it would be more natural to use an indirect quote for this sentence, such as: “what the prophet Isaiah predicted when he said that God would send his messenger.”
    * 


**ahead of you**  - In this phrase, the word “you” refers to the Messiah.
    * 


**prepare your way**  - God's messenger will prepare the people to listen to the Messiah.

Some **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/jew|Jews]]** asked **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/john-baptist|John]]** if he was the **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/messiah|Messiah]]**. John replied, “I am not the Messiah, but there is someone coming after me. **He is so great**  that I am **not even worthy to untie his sandals**.”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**He is so great**  - This could be translated as, “He is so important.”
    * 


**not even worthy to untie his sandals**  - In other words, “compared to him, I am not important enough to do even the most menial task for him.” Untying sandals was a very low job, something a slave would do.

The next day, **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/jesus|Jesus]]** came to be **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/baptize|baptized]]** by **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/john-baptist|John]]**. When John saw him, he said, “Look! **There is**  the **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/lamb|Lamb]] of [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]]** who **will take away**  the **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/sin|sin]] of the world**.”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**There is**  – For some languages this would be, “Here is” or, “That man is.”
    * 


**Lamb of God**  - This could also be translated as, “the Lamb from God” or, “the sacrifice Lamb that God has provided.” Jesus was the perfect sacrifice for sin that God promised to provide. He fulfills the image that was presented by the sacrifice of lambs in the Old Testament.
    * 


**will take away**  - The sacrifice of Jesus causes God to look at our sin as if it never existed.
    * 


**sin of the world**  - That is, “the sin of the people in the world.”

You should baptize me instead.” But Jesus said, “You should baptize me, because **it is the right thing to do**.” So John baptized him, even though Jesus had never **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/sin|sinned]]**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**I am not worthy to baptize you**  - This could be translated as, “I am not good enough to baptize you” or, “I am sinful, so I should not baptize you.”

**my Son whom I love**  - Make sure the translation of this does not sound like there was another son. It may be necessary to say, “You are my Son. I love you very much and am very pleased with you.”

==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**the Holy Spirit led him**  – That is, “the Holy Spirit guided him” or, “the Holy Spirit prompted him to go.”
    * 


**the wilderness**  - This could also be translated as, “the desert” or, “a remote, barren place with few people.” This place probably had very few trees or other plants, so most people would not be able to live there.
    * 


**forty days and forty nights**  - This means “forty days, both during the day and during the night.” Make sure the translation of this phrase does not sound like a period of eighty days.
    * 


**tempted him to sin**  - Since Jesus did not sin, make sure you use a word that does not imply that Satan succeeded in convincing Jesus to sin. This phrase could also be translated as, “tried to convince him to sin.”

==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**turn these rocks into bread**  - This may also be translated as, “make these rocks become bread” or, “supernaturally change these rocks into bread.”
    * 


**bread**  – This could be translated as, “food” for languages where bread is not a common food. In the Jews' culture, bread was the main food.

**throw yourself down**  - That is, “jump off this building to the ground.”

**it is written**  – That is, “a prophet of God wrote long ago.”

Jesus **opened up the scroll**  and read part of it to the people.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**place of worship**  – That is, “the building where the Jews gathered to worship God.” This can also be translated as, “worship building.”

Jesus said, “**The words I just read to you are happening right now**.” All the people were **amazed**. “**Isn’t this the son of [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/joseph-nt|Joseph]]**?” they said.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**The words I just read to you are happening right now**  - Other ways to translate this would be, “The words you just heard me read are being fulfilled right now” or, “Today the words I read to you came true as you heard them.”
    * 


**amazed**  - Translate the word “amazed” with a term that means that they were surprised, shocked, and confused about how this could be possible.
    * 


**Isn't this the son of Joseph?**  –This could also be translated as, “This man is only the son of Joseph!” or, “Everyone knows he is just Joseph's son!” The people were not asking if he was Joseph's son or not. They were wondering how he could be the Messiah since they thought he was only the son of an ordinary man.

During the time of the prophet **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/elijah|Elijah]]**, there were many widows in **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/israel|Israel]]**. But when it did not rain for three and a half years, **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]]** did not send Elijah to help a widow from Israel, but rather to a widow from a different nation.”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**no prophet is accepted in his hometown**  - This phrase means, “people do not recognize the authority of a prophet that has grown up among them.”

He only healed the skin disease of **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/naaman|Naaman]]**, **a commander**  of Israel’s enemies.” The people who were listening to Jesus were **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/jew|Jews]]**. So when they heard him say this, **they were furious at him**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**Elisha**  - Elisha was God's prophet who came after Elijah. Like Elijah, Elisha confronted Israelite kings who were sinning against God and he did miracles that God gave him power to do.
    * 


**a commander**  – That is, “a military leader.”
    * 


**they were furious at him**  - The Jews did not want to hear that God had blessed any people group besides themselves, so they were very angry at what Jesus said.

==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**place of worship**  - That is, “the building where the Jewish people gathered to worship God.” This can also be translated as “worship building.” See how you translated it in **[[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/sandbox/larrysallee/obs-training-text-and-notes#plugin_include__en__obs-training__frames__26-02|[26-02]]]**.

    * 


**One day**  - This phrase introduces an event that happened in the past, but does not state the specific time. Many languages have a similar way to begin telling a true story.

**expert in the Jewish law**  - This man was someone who studied and taught the laws God had given the Israelites, as well as other Jewish laws.
    * 


**to test him**  - That is, “to see if Jesus would give a good answer.”
    * 


**to inherit eternal life**  - That is, “to have life with God forever” or, “so that God will give me life with him forever” or, “to receive eternal life from God.” The law expert was asking how he could be worthy to receive eternal life as an inheritance from God the Father.
    * 


**eternal life**  - This refers to life forever with God after the mortal body dies. See the key term page for eternal life.
    * 


**What is written in God's law?**  - That is, “What is written in God's law about this?” Jesus asked this question because he wanted the man to think about what God's law really teaches.

**with all your heart, soul, strength, and mind**  - That is, “with your whole self” or, “with every part of yourself.” In some languages this might be translated as, “with all your liver, breath, strength, and thoughts.” The focus is not on each of these parts, but on all of us. Use the concepts in your language that make up the whole person.
    * 


**heart**  - The heart refers to the part of a person that has desires and emotions.
    *

    * 


**mind**  - The mind refers to the part of a person that thinks, plans, and has ideas.

**love your neighbor as yourself**  – That is, “love your neighbor to the same extent that you love yourself.”

(Jesus continues to tell the story.)


    *

**in charge of**  – That is, “who managed.” It could be that this person also owned this lodging place.

**the three men**  - The three men were the priest, the Levite, and the Samaritan.

**neighbor**  - Jesus is using the word “neighbor” in a broader sense than in **[[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/sandbox/larrysallee/obs-training-text-and-notes#plugin_include__en__obs-training__frames__27-02|[27-02]]]**. “Neighbor” here refers to anyone that we meet who needs our help.
    * 


**was a neighbor**  - This can also be translated as, “behaved as a neighbor” or, “was a friend” or, “acted in a loving way”. See how you translated “neighbor” in **[[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/sandbox/larrysallee/obs-training-text-and-notes#plugin_include__en__obs-training__frames__27-02|[27-02]]]** and **[[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/sandbox/larrysallee/obs-training-text-and-notes#plugin_include__en__obs-training__frames__27-03|[27-03]]]**.
    * 


**You go and do**  – That is, “You, too, should go and do” or, “Now you must do.” Jesus was commanding the law expert to do as the Samaritan did.
    * 


**do the same**  – That is, “love others, even your enemies.” Make sure it does not sound like “the same” is only referring to helping a wounded man.

    * 


**came up to Jesus**  - That is, “approached Jesus.”

**Good teacher**  - That is, “righteous teacher.” He was not saying that Jesus was simply a skilled teacher.
    * 


**to have eternal life**  - That is, “to receive eternal life” or, “to live with God forever.” Also consider how “eternal life” was translated on **[[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/sandbox/larrysallee/obs-training-text-and-notes#plugin_include__en__obs-training__frames__27-01|[27-01]]]** and see the note about that there.
    * 


**Why do you call me 'good'**  - Jesus is not denying that he is God. Rather, he is asking if the ruler understands that Jesus is God.

**There is only one who is good, and that is God**  - Another way to say this would be, “The only one who is truly good is God” or, “God is the only one who is truly good.”

**Which ones do I need to obey?**  - That is, “Which laws will be enough for me to receive eternal life?”

==== Translation Notes: ====

**you**  - If your language has different words for “you” depending on the number of people intended, use the singular form. Jesus was addressing this command to this one man.

==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**enter the kingdom of God**  - This can also be translated as, “become a citizen in God's kingdom.”
    * 


**camel**  - Camels are very large animals that are often used to carry heavy loads. If camels are not known in your language area, a phrase such as, “very large animal” or, “beast of burden” could be used. If you choose to substitute the name of some other large animal, make sure that the animal would have been known by the people Jesus was talking to, such as, “ox” or, “donkey.”
    * 


**eye of a needle**  - This refers to the tiny hole in the end of a sewing needle. The idea of something as large as a camel going through the eye of a needle is intended to represent something that is impossible.

==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**shocked**  - That is, “greatly astonished.”

**Not seven times, but seventy times seven!**  - This could be translated as, “You should not forgive only seven times, rather you should forgive seventy times seven times.” Jesus was not talking about an exact number. He was saying that we should forgive people every time they sin against us.

==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


(Jesus continues the story.)

==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**Meanwhile**  - That is, “while Jesus was praying on the mountainside.”
    * 


**rowing their boat**  - The boat had a sail, but it would not have worked when the wind was against them.

**great difficulty**  - That is, “much difficulty” or, “a lot of difficulty.”

Jesus knew that they were afraid, so he called out to them and said, “**Do not be afraid**. **It is I!**”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**a ghost**  - That is, “a spirit.” They thought Jesus was a spirit, since normally a human being cannot walk on water.
    * 


**Do not be afraid**  – For some languages it may be more natural to say here, “Stop being afraid.”
    * 


**it is I!**  - For some, it might be more natural to translate this as, “It is me, Jesus.”

==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**if it is you**  - That is, “if it is really you, and not a ghost.”

**turned his eyes away from**  - This expression means, “looked away from.” It could also be translated as, “stopped looking at.”

Then he said to Peter, “**You man of little [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/faith|faith]]**, **why did you doubt**?”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**You man of little faith**  - This may also be translated as, “You have so little faith in me!” or, “You do not trust me very much!”
    * 


**why did you doubt?**  - That is, “You should not have doubted me!” or, “You should have trusted me completely.” This isn't a real question, but a way in this language to make a strong point. In many languages, it works better to express this as a statement.

(Jesus continues the story.)


    * 


**stood far away **  - This can also be translated as, “stood at a distance” or, “stayed separate.”

**did not even look up to heaven**  - The word “even” indicates that people normally looked up to heaven when praying to God, but that this man did not because he was so ashamed of his sin.
    * 


**he pounded on his chest with his fist**  - This could also be translated as, “because of his grief, he hit his chest with his fist” or, “he pounded his chest in sorrow.” If people would find this hard to understand because they beat their chest for other reasons, you could translate this as, “he showed his despair.”

**declared him to be righteous**  - That is, “considered him to be a righteous person.” Even though the tax collector was a sinner, God was merciful to him because of his humility and repentance.

    * 


**One day**  - This phrase introduces an event that happened in the past, but does not state the specific time. Many languages have a similar way to begin telling a true story.

**tax collectors**  – Tax collectors were considered to be the worst of sinners because often they stole money from people by collecting a higher tax than the government required.

==== Translation Notes: ====

**story**  - Jesus used this story to teach truths about God's kingdom. It is not clear if the events actually happened or not. If your language has a term that includes both fictional and real stories, you should use it here.

    * 


**my inheritance**  – This could be translated as, “the part of your wealth that will be rightfully mine when you die.”

    * 


**wasted his money**  - That is, “spent all his money without getting anything of value in exchange.” In some languages it can be translated as, “threw his money away” or, “ate all his money.”

“After that, **a severe famine happened**  in the land where the younger son was, and he had **no money to buy food**. So he took the only job he could find, **feeding pigs**. He was so miserable and hungry that he wanted to eat the pigs’ food.”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


(Jesus continues the story.)


    * 


**a severe famine happened**  - That is, “there was very little food.” In some languages this might be translated as, “there was a severe famine.”
    * 


**no money to buy food**  - Because of the famine, food was very expensive, and he had already spent all of his money.
    * 


**job**  - This refers to work that he would do for someone else in exchange for money. If this is not clear, this sentence could start with, “So in order to earn some money, he took the only job.”
    * 


**feeding pigs**  - That is, “giving food to pigs.” This would have been considered as one of the lowest jobs in society at this time. If your language has a certain word for low status jobs, use that word.

==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


(Jesus continues the story.)


    * 


**What am I doing?**  - That is, “Why am I living like this?” or, ” I should not be living like this!” or, “It doesn't make sense for me to live like this.” The son isn't really asking a question, so some languages will have to translate this as a statement.

==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


(Jesus continues the story.)


    * 


**still far away**  – This can also be translated as, “within sight of his father's home, but still a distance away.” The son was getting close to his father's house but was still far enough away that most people in the house would not have seen him. Make sure it does not sound like he was still in a different country.
    * 


**felt compassion**  - That is, “felt deep love and pity.”

“But his father told one of his **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/servant|servants]]**, ‘Go quickly and bring the best clothes and put them on my **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/son|son]]**! Put a ring on his finger and put sandals on his feet. Then kill **the best calf**  so we can have a feast and celebrate, because **my son was [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/death|dead]], but now he is [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/life|alive]]!****He was lost, but now he is found!**’”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


(Jesus continues the story.)


    * 


**the best calf**  – This could also be translated as, “the fattest calf.” This was the calf that had been fattened so that when cooked it would taste the best.
    * 


**My son was dead, but now he is alive!**  - That is, “This is like my son was dead and is alive again!” or, “I grieved as if my son had died, but now I rejoice because it is as if he has come back to life!” The father is using this expression to show how happy he is that his son has come home.
    * 


**He was lost, but now he is is found!**  - That is, “This is like I had lost him but now I have found him.” This expression also shows how happy the father is about having his son at home again.

**Before long**  - This can also be translated as, “Soon” or, “After a little while.”

“When the older **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/son|son]]** found out that they were celebrating because his brother had come home, he was very angry and would not go into the house.

{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-35-12.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=ad4c6f?nolink&640x360}}


“The older son said to his father, ‘All these years I have worked **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/faithful|faithfully]]** for you! I never **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/disobey|disobeyed]]** you, and still you did not even give me **one small goat**  so I could celebrate with my friends. But when **this son of yours**  who **consumed your money**  in **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/sin|sinful]]** behavior came home, you **killed the best calf**  for him!’”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


(Jesus continues the story.)


    * 


**one small goat**  - A small goat would have fed fewer people than the best calf, and would not be valued as much. The older brother is complaining that his father was treating the sinful younger son better than him.
    * 


**this son of yours**  - This expression shows that the older son was angry. It shows his rejection of his younger brother and his disapproval of his father for welcoming back this wayward son. Other languages may also have an indirect way of communicating these things.
    * 


**consumed your money**  - That is, “squandered the money that you gave him” or, “devoured your wealth.” If possible, use an expression that shows the brother's anger.
    * 


**killed the best calf**  - That is, “killed the best calf to eat at a feast.”

{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-35-13.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=2dd210?nolink&640x360}}


“The father answered, ‘My **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/son|son]]**, you are always with me, and everything I have is yours. But **it is right for us**  to celebrate, because **your brother was [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/death|dead]], but now is [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/life|alive]]**. **He was lost, but now is found!**’”


//A Bible story from: Luke 15:11-32//


==== Translation Notes: ====

(Jesus continues the story.)


    * 


**it is right for us**  - That is, “it is the right thing for us to do” or, “it is proper for us.”
    * 


**your brother**  - The father refers to his younger son as, “your brother” to remind the older son of his relationship to the younger son and of how he should love his younger brother.

(The disciple named John was not the same person who **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/baptize|baptized]]** Jesus.) They went up on a high mountain by themselves to pray.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**One day**  - This phrase introduces an event that happened in the past, but does not state the specific time. Many languages have a similar way to begin telling a true story.
    * 


**James**  - This is a different James than the one who wrote the Book of James in the Bible. To make this clear, some languages may need to use two slightly different names or to spell them differently.

Let us make three **shelters**, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.” Peter **did not know what he was saying**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**shelters**  - This can also be translated as, “lean-tos” or, “garden huts” or, “tents.” It refers to small, individual, temporary shelters, like the Jews made from tree branches during an annual Jewish holiday.
    * 


**did not know what he was saying**  - That is, “was speaking without understanding what was happening” or, “spoke without thinking clearly because he was so excited.”

    * 


**terrified**–That is, “extremely scared.”
    * 


**fell on the ground**  – That is, “quickly bowed to the ground” or, “immediately got down on the ground.” Make sure the translation of “fell” does not sound like an accident. They probably did this intentionally out of awe and fear.

**touched them**  – That is, “put his hand on them.” Some languages may prefer to specify where he touched them. If so, this could be translated as, “he touched them on the shoulder” or, “he put his hand on each one's shoulder.”
    * 


**Do not be afraid**  – This could also be translated as, “Stop being afraid.”

**One day**, **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/jesus|Jesus]]** received a message that **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/lazarus|Lazarus]]** was very sick.

==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**One day**  - This phrase introduces an event that happened in the past, but does not state the specific time. Many languages have a similar way to begin telling a true story.
    * 


**Mary**  - Jesus' mother was also named Mary. This was a different woman.
    * 


**this sickness will not end in death**  - This can also be translated as, “the final result of this sickness will not be death” or, “Lazarus is sick, but death is not the final result of this sickness.” Jesus' disciples probably thought this meant that Lazarus would not die. But Jesus knew that, although Lazarus would die from his sickness, he would live in the end.
    * 


**it is for the glory of God**  - That is, “this will cause people to praise God for how great he is.”
    * 


**but he waited where he was for two days**  - This could be translated as, “but he stayed where he was for two days, even though they wanted him to go and heal Lazarus.”

==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**Judea**  - This refers to the southern section of Israel, which was settled by the tribe of Judah. Some languages will prefer to say, “the region of Judea.”

**has fallen asleep, and I must wake him.**  - Translate this phrase with the normal words for “asleep” and “wake” in your language. Although Jesus was using these words with a different meaning, the disciples did not understand that yet.

==== Translation Notes: ====

**he will get better**  - The disciples intended this in the sense of, “there is no reason for us to go to him now, since he will get well.”

**I am glad**  - This could be translated as, “I am happy” or, “It is good that.” It does not mean he was happy that Lazarus died, but rather that he was happy that God was going to show how great he is.

**I am the Resurrection and the Life**  - This is one of several very powerful “I am” statements in which Jesus says something about his essential nature. In this one, Jesus indicated that he is the “provider” or, “source” of resurrection and life. If possible, translate this phrase in a way that makes it clear that this is his essential nature. This can also be translated as, “I am the one who resurrects people and causes them to live.”
    * 


**will live, even though he dies.**  - That is, “will live forever, even if he dies.” The English word, “he” does not only refer to men. Women who believe in Jesus will also live forever.

**do you betray me with a kiss?**  - That is, “are you really going to betray me with a kiss?” Jesus is not looking for an answer to this question. So some languages would translate it as a statement, such as, “you are betraying me by kissing me!” or, “you make your betrayal even worse by kissing me!”

==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**the middle of the night**  - This expression means, “halfway through the night” or, “very late at night.”
    * 


**to question him**  – That is, “to ask Jesus questions to try to find something they could accuse Jesus of doing wrong.”

Inside the house, the **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/jewish-leaders|Jewish leaders]]****put [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/jesus|Jesus]] on trial**. They brought many false **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/witness|witnesses]]** who **lied about him**. However, **their statements did not agree with each other**, so the Jewish leaders could not prove **he was [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/guilt|guilty]] of anything**. Jesus did not say anything.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**put Jesus on trial**  – This could be translated as, “had a formal meeting to accuse Jesus of doing something wrong.” Usually a trial is done to find out if someone is innocent or guilty of a certain crime. In this case, the leaders were determined to make Jesus seem guilty.
    * 


**lied about him**  - That is, “told lies about him” or, “falsely accused him of doing something wrong.”
    * 


**their statements did not agree with each other**  - This could be translated as, “they said things about Jesus that were very different from each other” or, “the witnesses said things about Jesus that contradicted each other.”
    * 


**he was guilty of anything**  – That is, “that he had done anything wrong.”

You have heard him say that he is the **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god-son|Son of God]]**. **What is your [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/judge|judgment]]**?”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**I am**  - That is, “I am as you said” or, “I am the Messiah and the Son of God.” “I am” is also the name of God (See **[[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/sandbox/larrysallee/obs-training-text-and-notes#plugin_include__en__obs-training__frames__09-14|[09-14]]]**). By saying simply, “I am” Jesus was also saying that he is God. If possible, translate this so that people will see a similarity between Jesus' answer and the name of God.
    * 


**seated with God**  - This could be translated as, “reigning with God.” Because God is the ruler over all, people talk about him as sitting on a throne in heaven. By saying that he would be seated with God, Jesus claimed that he had authority to rule with the Father.
    * 


**seated with God and coming from heaven**  – This could be translated as, “sitting beside God and then coming from heaven.”
    * 


**tore his clothes in anger**  - The Jews would tear their clothes to show grief or anger. If tearing the clothes means something else in your language, you may want to substitute a phrase such as, “he was extremely angry.”
    * 


**What is your judgment?**  - That is, “What is your decision?” or, “Tell us what have you decided: Is he innocent or guilty?” The chief priest wanted the religious leaders to condemn Jesus for claiming to be equal with God.

==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**they blindfolded Jesus**  - That is. “they covered Jesus' eyes so that he could not see.”
    * 


**spit on him**  - This could also be translated as, “spit on him to insult him” or, “spit on him in order to say that he was worthless.” This was a way of showing contempt for someone.

Later, another girl said the same thing, and **Peter denied it again**. Finally, the people said, “We know that you were with Jesus because you both **are from [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/galilee|Galilee]]**.”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**denied it**  - This can be translated as, “said that it was not true” or, “said that he was not with Jesus” or, “said, 'No. That is not true.'”
    * 


**Peter denied it again**  – This could be translated as, “Peter denied knowing Jesus a second time” or, “again Peter said he had not been with Jesus.”
    * 


**are from Galilee**  - This could also be translated as, “are Galileans.” The people could tell from the way Jesus and Peter talked that they came from the region of Galilee.

==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**vowed**  - That is, “said emphatically” or, “said very strongly.”
    * 


**May God curse me if I know this man**  - This is a curse that means, “May God cause harm to me if what you say is true” or, “May God punish me if I am lying to you!” In this way Peter was saying very strongly that he did not know Jesus. He also referred to Jesus as, “this man” to make it sound like he did not know him.
    * 


**a rooster crowed**  - “Crowing” is the loud sound that a rooster makes. Compare how you translated this in **[[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/sandbox/larrysallee/obs-training-text-and-notes#plugin_include__en__obs-training__frames__38-09|[38-09]]]**.

The **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/rome|Roman]]** soldiers whipped Jesus and put **a royal robe**  and a **crown made of thorns**  on him.

//A Bible story from: Matthew 26:57-27:26; Mark 14:53-15:15; Luke 22:54-23:25; John 18:12-19:16//


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**riot**  - That is, “start doing violent things in their anger.”
    * 


**a royal robe**  - That is, “a robe like a king's robe.” This robe had a bright color, so it looked like the kind of robe that a king would wear.
    * 


**crown made of thorns**  - This means that they tied thorn branches into a circle to look like a crown. A crown is an ornament that a king wears on his head to show his authority. But the crown that they put on Jesus' head had sharp, dangerous thorns on it.
    * 


**Look**  – That is, “Look at” or, ”Here is.”
    * 


**the King of the Jews**  – Since the soldiers were mocking Jesus, this could be translated as, “the so-called King of the Jews.”
    *

==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**the Skull**  - A hill near Jerusalem with a white, rocky top that was shaped somewhat like the top of a skull.
    * 


**forgive them, because they do not know what they are doing**  - That is, “they do not understand the meaning of what they are doing, so please forgive them.” The soldiers thought Jesus was only a criminal who deserved to die. They did not understand that he was the Son of God.

**gambled for Jesus' clothing**  - That is, “played a game of chance to win Jesus' clothes.” We do not know how they did this, but in some cultures it could be translated as, “tossed stones on the ground to win Jesus' clothing” or, “chose sticks to decide who could take Jesus' clothes.”

==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**two robbers**  - This could also be translated as, “two bandits.” This refers to criminals who used force or violence to steal things.
    * 


**Do you have no fear of God?**  - The robber does not expect an answer to this question; it is a way that some languages use to make a strong statement. If your language does not use questions in this way, then translate this as, “You should fear God!”
    * 


**We are guilty but this man is innocent**  – This could be translated as, “You and I have done evil things and deserve to die, but this man, Jesus, has done nothing wrong and does not deserve to die.” “We” here includes both robbers, but does not include Jesus.
    * 


**this man**  - This phrase refers to Jesus.
    * 


**Please remember me**  - That is, “Please accept me” or, “Please welcome me” or, “Please allow me to be with you.” “Remember” here does not mean to recall something after forgetting it. Translate this in a way that communicates a humble request.
    * 


**in your kingdom**  – That is, “when you establish your kingdom” or, “when you are ruling as king.”
    * 


**Paradise**  - This is another name for “heaven.”

While the **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/believer|believers]]** were all together, suddenly the house where they were was filled with **a sound like a strong wind**. Then something that looked like flames of fire appeared over the heads of all the believers. They were all **filled with the [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/holy-spirit|Holy Spirit]]** and they began to speak **in other languages**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**a sound like a strong wind**  - That is, “a noise that a strong wind makes” or, “the sound that the wind makes when it blows hard.”
    * 


**filled with the Holy Spirit**  - That is, “given ability by the Holy Spirit” or, “given power by the Holy Spirit.”
    * 


**in other languages**  - This could be translated as, “in languages other than their own language” or, “in foreign languages” or, “as people from other places speak.” The believers did not know these languages until the Holy Spirit gave them the power to speak them. Make sure the word used to translate “languages” refers to languages people actually speak and understand.

==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


(Peter continues preaching to the crowd.)


    * 


**Men of Israel**  – For some languages it is better to say, “People of Israel” for it to be clear that this included men and women. This could also be translated as, “My fellow people of Israel” or, “My fellow Jews” to make it clear that Peter was also a Jew and belonged to the “people of Israel.”
    * 


**you crucified him!**  - This could also be translated as, “you caused him to be crucified” or, “because of you, he was crucified.” The Jews did not actually nail Jesus to the cross. However, the Jewish leaders caused him to be condemned and many of the people in the crowd had shouted for him to be crucified.

==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


(Peter continues preaching to the crowd.)


    * 


**This fulfills the prophecy which says**  – Another way to translate this would be, “This caused to come true what one of the prophets said long ago.”
    * 


**You will not let your**  - “You” and “your” refer to God the Father. To make that clear, this could be translated as, “You, God, will not let your.” Some languages may have a special way of addressing someone, such as, “You, O God.”
    * 


**rot in the grave**  - That is, “decay in the tomb” or, “decompose in the grave.” This refers to the fact that Jesus did not remain in the tomb very long and is another way of saying that he did not stay dead, but rather came back to life again.
    * 


**raised Jesus to life again**  - That is, “made Jesus alive again.”

==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**deeply moved by**  - That is, “very troubled by” or, “felt very sad when they heard.” To be “moved” is to feel strong emotions.
    * 


**Brothers**  - This was a normal way for a Jew to address fellow Jews. It could also be translated as, “Friends.”

==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**in the name of**  - This phrase means both, “by the authority of” and, “under the authority of.” Consider translating the word “name” literally if it will be understood in this way in your language.
    * 


**Christ**  – This is the same meaning as “Messiah.” It could be translated as “Anointed One” or, “Chosen One.” Instead of translating the meaning, some translators may choose to keep the word “Christ” and spell it using the sounds in their own language.
    * 


**Jesus Christ**  – Since “Christ” is a title here, some translators may choose to change the order and say, “Christ Jesus.” Both orders are used in the Bible.

He did not **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/believe|believe]]** in **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/jesus|Jesus]]**, and so he **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/persecute|persecuted]]** the **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/believer|believers]]**. He went **from house to house**  in **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/jerusalem|Jerusalem]]** to arrest both men and women and to put them in prison.

They put **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/paul|Paul]]** and **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/silas|Silas]]** in the most secure part of the prison and even locked up their feet. Yet **in the middle of the night**, they were **singing songs of [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/praise|praise]] to [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]]**.


==== Translation Notes: ====

**flew open**  - That is, “became unlocked and suddenly opened wide.”
    * 


**fell off**  - That is, “suddenly came off” or, “suddenly came apart so that the prisoners were released.”

**The jailer**  woke up, and when he saw that the prison doors were open, he was terrified! He thought all the prisoners had escaped, so he planned to kill himself. (He knew the **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/rome|Roman authorities]]** would kill him if he allowed the prisoners to escape.) But **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/paul|Paul]]** saw him and yelled, “Stop! Do not hurt yourself. **We**  are all here.”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**The jailer**  - That is, “the official in charge of the jail.”
    * 


**We**  - Some languages have a special form of the word “we” which does not include the person being talked to. Here the “we” does not include the jailer, only Paul and the rest of the prisoners.

The jailer trembled as he came to **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/paul|Paul]]** and **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/silas|Silas]]** and asked, “What must I do **to be [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/save|saved]]**?” **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/paul|Paul]]** answered, “**[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/believe|Believe]] in [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/jesus|Jesus]], the [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/lord|Master]]**, and **you and your family will be [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/save|saved]]**.” Then the jailer took Paul and Silas into his home and washed their wounds. Paul **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/preach|preached]]** the **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/good-news|good news]]** about Jesus to everyone in his house.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**to be saved**  - This could also be translated as, “in order to be saved from my sins” or “so that God will save me from my sins.” The question refers to salvation from being punished by the God who caused the earthquake.
    * 


**Believe in Jesus, the Master**  - This is addressed to both the jailer and his family, who all then believed and were baptized. Some languages may use a form to indicate that Paul is speaking to the group.
    * 


**you and your family will be saved**  - This can also be translated as, “God will save you and your family from eternal punishment for your sins.” Make sure it is clear that the salvation referred to here is spiritual, not physical.

The jailer and his whole family **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/believe|believed]]** in **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/jesus|Jesus]]** and were **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/baptize|baptized]]**.

This was the way God wanted the world to be.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**God created the world**  - That is, “God made the world out of nothing.”
    * 


**perfect**  - That is, “exactly as it should be” to accomplish all that God intended for it.
    * 


**There was no sin**  - For some languages it is not possible to express “sin” as a thing, rather it is an action. In those cases this could be translated as, “No one ever sinned” or, “People did not sin” or, “Nothing evil had happened.”
    * 


**There was no sickness or death**  - That is, “No one got sick and no one died” or, “They did not get sick or die.”

==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**the garden**  - This refers to the garden created by God where he placed the first man and woman.
    * 


**deceive Eve**  - That is, “lie to Eve.” Satan lied by leading Eve to doubt what God had said. By doing this, he tricked her into disobeying God.

They became enemies of **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]]**. As a result, every person since then has been born with a sinful nature and is also an enemy of God. The relationship between God and people was broken by sin. But God had a plan to restore that relationship.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**even more terrible**  - That is, “much worse” or, “worse yet.”

**[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]]** **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/promise|promised]]** that one of **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/eve|Eve's]]** **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/descendant|descendants]]** would **crush [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/satan|Satan's]] head**, and Satan would **wound his heel**. This meant that Satan would kill the **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/messiah|Messiah]]**, but God would **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/raise|raise]] him to [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/life|life]] again**, and then the Messiah will crush the power of Satan forever. Many years later, God revealed that **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/jesus|Jesus]]** is the Messiah.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**crush Satan's head**  - This could also be translated as, “step on Satan's head and smash it down flat” or, “shatter Satan's head by stepping on it.” This is an image of a person stepping on the head of a snake. The head is completely crushed, and the snake is dead and therefore harmless.
    * 


**wound his heel**  - This is an image of a snake on the ground biting a person's foot. In this case, Satan would cause the Messiah to suffer, but would not destroy him.
    * 


**raise him to life again**  - That is, “make him alive again.”

But those sacrifices could not take away their sin. **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/jesus|Jesus]]** is the **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/priest-high|Great High Priest]]**. Unlike other priests, **he offered himself**  as the only sacrifice that could to take away the sin of all the people in the world.

While he was sleeping, his enemy came and planted **weed seeds**  along with the **wheat**, and then he went away.”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**good seed**  – This seed was wheat grain. If this type of seed is not known in your language area, it is best to use a general term for “seed.” If there is no general term, it may be necessary to choose a type of grain seed that is known and say, for example, “good seed like rice.”
    * 


**weed seeds**  - The weed seeds that were planted would grow up as tall grass but could not be eaten. They were useless.
    * 


**wheat**  – That is, “wheat seeds.” Wheat is a kind of grain that grows like a tall grass. It has seeds that people use for food.

**An enemy must have planted them**  - If possible, translate this in a way that indicates that the speaker did not see this happen.

Wait **until the harvest**  and then gather the weeds into piles to be burned, but bring **the wheat**  into my **barn**.’”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


(Jesus continues to tell the story.)


    * 


**you will pull out some of the wheat as well**  - That is, “you will accidentally pull out some of the wheat also.” It would be too difficult to distinguish young wheat from the weeds, and to pull the weeds without uprooting the wheat.
    * 


**until the harvest**  - That is, “until the time when the wheat is ready to harvest” or, “until the wheat has grown enough to be harvested.”
    * 


**the wheat**  – That is, “the harvested wheat grains.”
    * 


**barn**  - This refers to the building where the harvested wheat grain was saved and stored. It could also be called a “storehouse.”

==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**who belong to the evil one**  - That is, “who obey the evil one” or, “who are ruled by the evil one.”
