**Comprehension questions/answers: [draft 1]** 


    * One of the most basic questions that every person has is, "Where did I come from?" What do people in your culture typically believe? This story is the God's answer to that question.
    * This story is not presented as a fable, but as the true account of what really happened.
    * God is the eternal, self-existent creator of everything that exists. How does this compare to the normal understanding of God in your culture?
    * The reference to the Spirit of God and the plural pronoun "us" begin to open our understanding that God exists in more than one person.
    * God made "in His image" to have a special relationship with Him and to enjoy and care for his creation. What evidence do you see in the story that man has a deeper relationship to God than the other creatures do?
    * God made the woman to be the perfect helper for the man, completing him so that he could fulfill God's purpose for his life. What does this speak to the value and role of women?
    * When God completed his work of creation after six days, everything was good. There was no sin or imperfection. Adam and Eve lived in harmony with God, doing his will in the earth. How does this compare to our situation today?
    * God provided a special garden for the Adam and Eve where they would have everything they needed for an abundant life. What provisions do you see in the story?
    * God did not create sin. He did, however, place the tree of the knowledge of good and evil in the garden as a test so Adam and Eve could decide if they were satisfied to live with God's good provision for them. Why was it important that man choose whether to obey God?
    * God set the seventh day apart as a holy reminder that he completed his work of creation in six days. Why are religious reminders so important for us?


**Comprehension questions/answers: [draft 2]** 


    * One of the most basic questions that every person has is, "Where did I come from?" This story is the God's answer to that question. God says that he is the source of everything.
    * This story is not presented as a fable, but as the true account of what really happened.
    * God is eternal–existing before anything else. He is the creator of everything else. Therefore, he has complete authority over everything and everyone. He is also all-powerful. He simply spoke the creation into existence.
    * The reference to the Spirit of God and the plural pronoun "us" begin to open our understanding that God exists in more than one person.
    * God made people "in His image" to have a special relationship with Him and to enjoy and care for his creation. He created them as male and female to have an intimate, personal relationship with each other, and with him. Relationships are a major theme in the Bible.
    * God made the woman to be an appropriate helper for the man, formed directly from his body. Her creation from his rib introduces her biblical position "along side" her husband–not over or under him. She completed him, making it possible for him to fulfill God's purpose for his life.
    * God brought Eve to Adam as his wife, and continues to exalt marriage throughout the Bible. Marriage also serves as an example of the believer's relationship to God–Israel is called the wife of God, and and the church is the bride of Christ.
    * When God completed his work of creation after six days, everything was good. There was no sin or imperfection. Adam and Eve lived in harmony with God, doing his will in the earth. This is the God's intention for us. It will also become the eternal situation of all believers at the end of the God's story.
    * God provided a special garden for the Adam and Eve where they would have everything they needed for an abundant life. Even today, God continue to provide for us, in spite of the fact that we do not fully obey him.
    * God placed the tree of the knowledge of good and evil in the garden as a test so Adam and Eve could decide if they were satisfied to live with God's good provision for them. God did not create sin. Everything he made was good. Neither did he force us to be holy. Instead, he allowed Adam and Eve to decide whether to obey him and live, or to sin and die.
    * God set the seventh day apart as a holy reminder that he completed his work of creation in six days. Throughout scripture, God commands us to do various things in order to remember his character, his faithfulness, and our responsibility to him.
