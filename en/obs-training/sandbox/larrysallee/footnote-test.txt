This is how the beginning((**the beginning**  - that is, "the beginning of all things," before anything existed except God)) of everything happened. **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** created((**created**  - here used in the sense of making something out of nothing)) the universe and everything in it in six days((**six days**  - six cycles of darkness followed by light)). At first, the earth was dark((**dark**  - God had not yet created light.)) and empty((**empty**  - God had not yet created anything else except for the bare earth covered by water.)), and nothing had been formed((**nothing had been formed**  - There were no distinguishing featuresâ€“just water covering everything.)) in it. But **[[:en:key-terms:holy-spirit|God's Spirit]]** was there((**[[:en:obs-training/sandbox/chrislane/god-s_spirit|God's Spirit]] was there**  - The Spirit of God, sometimes called the Holy Spirit, was present in the beginning, moving freely over the earth in order to create all that He had planned to do.)) over the water.
