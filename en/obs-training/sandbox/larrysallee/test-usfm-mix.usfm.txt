\v2 What I want to tell you\add* begins just like the prophet Isaiah \add said it would begin, when\add* he wrote \add these words that God said to his Son:\add* \q Listen! I am sending my messenger ahead of you. He will prepare \add people for\add* your\add coming\add*. 
\v 3 He will call out to people \add who pass by where he is\add* in the desolate area, "As people straighten out pathways \add before an important official arrives\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, make\add yourselves\add* ready \f + \ft doublet \f* \add in order that you will be prepared when\add* the Lord \add comes\add*."

\v 4 \add The messenger that Isaiah predicted was\add* John. \add People called him\add* 'The Baptizer'. In the desolate area near the Jordan River he kept telling people, "If you want God to forgive you for having sinned, you must turn away from your sinful behavior \add before you ask me to\add* baptize\add you\add*." 
\v 5 A great number \f + \ft hyperbole \f* of people who lived in Jerusalem \add city\add* and \add elsewhere\add* in the Judea \add district\add* were going out to where John was. There, \add after hearing John's message\add*, they \add responded by\add* confessing the sinful things \add that they had done\add*. Then they were being baptized by John {John was baptizing them} in the Jordan River.

\v 6 John wore \add rough\add* clothes made of camel's hair. And \add as the prophet Elijah had done\add*, he wore a leather belt around his waist; and what he ate was \add only\add* grasshoppers and honey \add that he found\add* in that desolate area. 
\v 7 He was preaching, "Very shortly a man will come who is very great. I \add am nothing compared to him. Because he is so superior to me\add*, I am not even worthy to \add serve him like a slave\add* by stooping down and untying his sandals. 
\v 8 I used \add only\add* water when I baptized you \add because you said that you wanted to change your lives\add*, but he will put his Holy Spirit \add within\add* you \add to truly change your lives\add*."
