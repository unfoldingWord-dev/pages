==== Meaning in Open Bible Stories: ====

In the Open Bible stories, the term "to create" means to make something out of nothing, to bring it into existence, or to cause something to exist. It refers to a divine activity. 

This creation is not the same as when a person puts existing materials together in a new arrangement. People must have the raw materials. God does not need them. He simply spoke and everything came into being. The results were immediate, and supernatural.
