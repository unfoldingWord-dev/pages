This is how **the beginning ** of everything happened. **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]] created**the **universe** and everything in it in six days. After God created the earth it was **dark ** and **empty**, and **nothing had been formed ** in it. But **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/holy-spirit|God's Spirit]]** was there over the water.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**the beginning**  - That is, “the beginning of all things,” before anything existed except God.
    * 


**created**  - This is used here in the sense of making something out of nothing.
    * 


**universe**  - This includes everything that God created on the earth and in the heavens, both visible and invisible things.
    * 


**dark**  - It was completely dark. There was no light at all, since God had not yet created light.
    * 


**empty**  - God had not yet created anything except for the bare earth covered by water.
    * 


**nothing had been formed**  - There were no distinguishing features–just water covering everything.
    * 


**God's Spirit**  - The Spirit of God, sometimes called the Holy Spirit, was present in the beginning, moving freely over the earth in order to create all that he had planned to do.
