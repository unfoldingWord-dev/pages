====== Sin ======

Sin is the general word for attitudes and actions that displease God. Translate "sin" with a word or term that is broad enough to convey a wide variety of wrong thoughts or deeds. A person can also sin against another person. However, it is considered "sin" because it violates the way God commanded us to treat other people.

The root idea is that of "missing the mark." The same term is used in the Old Testament for soldiers missing their target with a sling and stone. Theologically, it refers to anything that does not measure up to the standards set by God. 

There are many different ways in which a person can sin against God. The most common are:

=== Rebellion ===

Some sin is intentional. We can defy God, refusing to obey His commands. This is perhaps the most serious form of sin.

=== Falling Short ===

We may attempt to please God, but not be successful due to human weakness or other hindrances. Good intentions and partial obedience are not enough. If we fall short of the attitudes and actions that God requires, we sin.

=== Unbelief ===

Some people may have heard what God requires, but do not actually believe that He is real, or that His commandments are true. However, failure to obey God is sin, even if we do not believe.

=== Oversight ===

It possible to sin without knowing about it. These sins of oversight are still considered to be sin, even if we are unaware that they are wrong.
