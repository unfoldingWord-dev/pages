{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-01-01.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=33dc3b?nolink&640x360}}


This is how **the beginning ** of everything happened. **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]] created**the **universe** and everything in it in six days. After God created the earth it was **dark ** and **empty**, and **nothing had been formed ** in it. But **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/holy-spirit|God's Spirit]]** was there over the water.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**the beginning**  - That is, “the beginning of all things,” before anything existed except God.
    * 


**created**  - This is used here in the sense of making something out of nothing.
    * 


**universe**  - This includes everything that God created on the earth and in the heavens, both visible and invisible things.
    * 


**dark**  - It was completely dark. There was no light at all, since God had not yet created light.
    * 


**empty**  - God had not yet created anything except for the bare earth covered by water.
    * 


**nothing had been formed**  - There were no distinguishing features–just water covering everything.
    * 


**God's Spirit**  - The Spirit of God, sometimes called the Holy Spirit, was present in the beginning, moving freely over the earth in order to create all that he had planned to do.

{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-01-02.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=e556c6?nolink&640x360}}


Then **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]] said**, “**Let there be**  light!” And there was **light**. God saw that the light **was [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/good|good]]** and called it “day.” He separated it from the darkness, which he called “night.” God created the light on the first day of **creation**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**God said**  - God created light by means of a simple verbal command.
    * 


**let there be**  - This is a command that happened immediately because it was spoken by God. It may be more natural to translate this as a statement of certainty that this would definitely happen. For example, you could translate this as, “God said, 'There will be light.'”
    * 


**light**  - This was a special light that God created–the sun was not created until later.
    * 


**was good**  - This phrase is often repeated through the Creation story, and emphasizes that each stage of creation was pleasing to God and accomplished his plan and purpose.
    * 


**creation**  - This word is used here to refer to the six-day period during which God made everything that exists.

On **the second day**  of creation, **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]] spoke**and **created**  the **sky**  above the earth. He made the sky by separating the water above from the water below.

**created**  - God made the sky out of nothing.

On **the fifth day**, **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]] spoke**and made **everything that swims**  in the water and **all the birds**. God saw that **it was [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/good|good]]**, and he **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/bless|blessed]] them**.

==== Translation Notes: ====

**the sixth day**  - The next event in a continuing, orderly progression of days and creative acts.
    *

**all kinds**  - This indicates a great variety, but also order.
    * 


**land animals**  - Every kind of animal that lived on the land, as opposed to the birds, or animals that live in the seas.
    * 


**farm animals**  - The kinds of land animals that commonly live peacefully with people–-as in tame, or domesticated animals.
    * 


**crawled on the ground**  - This probably includes reptiles, and possibly the insects.
    * 


**wild**  - The kinds of animals that do not normally live peacefully with people, usually because they are afraid of people, or dangerous to them.
    * 


**it was good**  - This phrase is repeated throughout creation to show that every step went exactly according to God's wise plan and purpose.
**[[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/sandbox/larrysallee/obs-training-text-and-notes#plugin_include__en__obs-training__frames__01-07|<<]] | [[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/01-the-creation|Up]] | [[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/sandbox/larrysallee/obs-training-text-and-notes#plugin_include__en__obs-training__frames__01-09|>>]]**


===== God Made Man in His Image [01-09] =====

Then **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]]** said, “**Let us**  make human beings **in our image**  to be **like us**. They will have **authority**  over the earth and all the animals.”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**Let us**  - This indicates God's deliberate, willful decision to create man in a particular way for a particular purpose. You could translate this as, “We will make.”
    * 


**us…our…us**  - The Bible teaches that there is one God, but the Old Testament word “God” is a plural form, and God uses plural pronouns when speaking to himself. Some understand this as a special way of speaking that expresses God's majesty, and others understand this as God the Father speaking to the Son and the Spirit, who are all God.
    * 


**in our image**  - An image is a physical representation of someone or something. Humans were made in such a way that we display or represent some of the qualities or traits of God.
    * 


**like us**  - Humans share some of God's characteristics, but not all of his qualities. This phrase should be translated with words that show man is similar to God, but not equal with him or the same as he is.
    * 


**authority**  - God gave people the right and power to manage, guide, and control how the earth and the animals will be used.
**[[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/sandbox/larrysallee/obs-training-text-and-notes#plugin_include__en__obs-training__frames__01-08|<<]] | [[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/01-the-creation|Up]] | [[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/sandbox/larrysallee/obs-training-text-and-notes#plugin_include__en__obs-training__frames__01-10|>>]]**


===== God Made Adam [01-10] =====

So **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]]****took some dirt**, **formed it**  into **a man**, and **breathed [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/life|life]]** into him. This man's name was **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/adam|Adam]]**. God planted a **garden**  where Adam could live, and put him there to **care for it**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**took some dirt**  - God made man from the dust, or dry dirt from the ground. This word should probably be different from the general word used for earth.
    * 


**formed it**  - This word expresses that God personally fashioned the man, comparing this to how a person creates something with his hands. Make sure that a different word from “create” is used. Note that this is very different from how he created everything else through a simple spoken command.
    * 


**a man**  - Only the man was created at this time; the woman was created later by a different method.
    * 


**breathed life**  - This phrase expresses God's very personal, intimate action as he transferred life from himself into Adam's body, comparing this to how a human being breathes out air.
    * 


**life**  - In this event, God breathed both physical and spiritual life into the man.
    * 


**Adam**  - Adam's name is the same as the Old Testament word for “man,” and similar to the word for “dirt” from which he was formed.
    * 


**garden**  - An area of land planted with trees and plants for a purpose–usually to produce food or to provide beauty.
    * 


**care for it**  - To maintain the garden by tending, weeding, watering, harvesting, planting, etc.
**[[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/sandbox/larrysallee/obs-training-text-and-notes#plugin_include__en__obs-training__frames__01-09|<<]] | [[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/01-the-creation|Up]] | [[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/sandbox/larrysallee/obs-training-text-and-notes#plugin_include__en__obs-training__frames__01-11|>>]]**


===== Two Trees [01-11] =====


{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-01-11.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=579045?nolink&640x360}}


**In the middle**  of the **garden**, **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]]** planted two special trees—the **tree of [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/life|life]]** and the **tree of the knowledge**  of **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/good|good]]** and **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/evil|evil]]**. God told **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/adam|Adam]]** that he could eat from any tree in the garden except from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. If he ate from this tree, he would **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/death|die]]**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**in the middle**  - The central location emphasizes the importance of the two trees.
    * 


**garden**  - An area of land planted with trees and plants for a purpose–usually to produce food or to provide beauty.
    * 


**tree of life**  - Anyone who ate fruit from this tree would never die.
    * 


**tree of knowledge of good and evil**  - The fruit of this tree could enable a person to know both good and evil.
    * 


**knowledge**  - To know or understand by personal experience.
    * 


**good and evil**  - Evil is the opposite of good. Just as “good” refers to what is pleasing to God, “evil” refers to everything that is not pleasing to God.
    * 


**die**  - In this instance, he would die both physically and spiritually.
**[[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/sandbox/larrysallee/obs-training-text-and-notes#plugin_include__en__obs-training__frames__01-10|<<]] | [[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/01-the-creation|Up]] | [[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/sandbox/larrysallee/obs-training-text-and-notes#plugin_include__en__obs-training__frames__01-12|>>]]**

{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-01-12.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=d0291e?nolink&640x360}}


Then **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]]** said, “It is **not [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/good|good]]** for man to be **alone**.” But none of the animals could be **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/adam|Adam's]] helper**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**not good**  - This is the first time that anything in creation was not good. It means it was, “not yet good” because God was not finished with the creation of humans.
    * 


**alone**  - Adam was the only human, with no possibility of a relationship with another person, and unable to reproduce children and multiply.
    * 


**Adam's helper**  - There was no one who was similar enough to Adam to join with him to accomplish the task that God gave to him. None of the animals could do this.
**[[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/sandbox/larrysallee/obs-training-text-and-notes#plugin_include__en__obs-training__frames__01-11|<<]] | [[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/01-the-creation|Up]] | [[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/sandbox/larrysallee/obs-training-text-and-notes#plugin_include__en__obs-training__frames__01-13|>>]]**


===== God Made Eve [01-13] =====


{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-01-13.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=eaaa7e?nolink&640x360}}


So **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]]** made **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/adam|Adam]]** fall into **a deep sleep**. Then God **took one of Adam's ribs and made**  it into **a woman**  and **brought her to him**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**a deep sleep**  - This was a deeper sleep than normal.
    * 


**took one of Adam's ribs and made**  - The verbs indicate God's very personal act of removing the rib from Adam and shaping it into a woman.
    *

    * 


**brought her to him**  - God personally introduced them. He presented the woman to Adam, almost like offering a special gift.

===== Adam Met Eve [01-14] =====


{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-01-14.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=8c7b12?nolink&640x360}}


When **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/adam|Adam]]** saw her, he said, “**At last**! This one is **like me**! Let her be called '**Woman**,' for she was **made from Man**.” This is why **a man leaves**  his father and mother and **becomes one**  with his wife.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**At last!**  - Adam's exclamation indicates that he had been waiting for something like the woman.
    * 


**like me**  - The woman was the same type of being as Adam, even though there were important differences between them.
    * 


**Woman**  - This word is the feminine form of the word for man.
    * 


**made from man**  - The woman was formed directly from Adam's own body.
    * 


**a man leaves**  - This is stated in the present tense to indicate what would become the normal situation in the future. Adam did not have a mother or father, but all other men would.

{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-01-15.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=4adb55?nolink&640x360}}


**[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]] made**man and woman **in his own image**. He **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/bless|blessed]]** them and told them, “Have many children and grandchildren and fill the earth!” And God saw that everything he had made was **very [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/good|good]]**, and he was very pleased with all of it. This all happened on the sixth day of **creation**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**God made**  - God formed the man and the woman in a very personal way.
    * 


**in his own image**  - An image is a physical representation of someone or something. God made people to display or represent some of his qualities and traits, but not to be equal to him.

{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-01-16.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=375750?nolink&640x360}}


When **the seventh day**  came, **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]]** had **finished his work**. So **God rested**  from all he had been doing. He **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/bless|blessed]] the seventh day**and **made it [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/holy|holy]]**, because on this day he rested from his work.

===== A Perfect World [02-01] =====


{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-02-01.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=abeb37?nolink&640x360}}


**[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/adam|Adam]]** and his wife were very happy living in the beautiful garden **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]]** had made for them. Neither of them wore clothes, but this did not cause them to feel any **shame**, because there was no **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/sin|sin]]** in the world. They often walked in the garden and **talked with God**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**garden**  - A special collection of trees and plants that God prepared for Adam and Eve to enjoy and from which to eat. This should be the same word that was used in **[[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/sandbox/larrysallee/obs-training-text-and-notes#plugin_include__en__obs-training__frames__01-11|[01-11]]]**. See how you translated it there.
    * 


**talked with God**  - The word for “talk” should be the same as would be used to refer to talking to a human being. God may have taken a physical form to talk to the man and the woman since the text indicates that they talked to him face-to-face.
    * 


**shame**  - The feeling that comes with knowing we have sinned or that we fall short in some way. Before sin came into the world, there was no sense of shame about being naked.

===== The Snake [02-02] =====


{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-02-02.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=387bb6?nolink&640x360}}


But there was a **crafty snake**  in the garden. He asked the woman, “**Did [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]] really tell you**not to eat the **fruit from any of the trees**  in the garden?”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**crafty**  - Clever and sly, with the intent to deceive.
    * 


**snake**  - An elongated, legless land creature that now moves by wiggling on its belly. Although later on in the story it is revealed that the snake is Satan, this should not be said here in this frame.
    * 


**Did God really tell you**  - The snake asked the woman whether God actually said not to eat from any of the trees in the garden. But he was only pretending that he didn't know what God had said because he wanted to create doubt in the woman's mind. He wanted her to question God's goodness.
    * 


**fruit of any of the trees**  - All of the various types of fruit from each of the different trees in the garden.
**[[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/sandbox/larrysallee/obs-training-text-and-notes#plugin_include__en__obs-training__frames__02-01|<<]] | [[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/02-sin-enters-the-world|Up]] | [[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/sandbox/larrysallee/obs-training-text-and-notes#plugin_include__en__obs-training__frames__02-03|>>]]**


===== Do Not Touch [02-03] =====


{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-02-03.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=3afc7f?nolink&640x360}}


The woman answered, “**[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]]** told us we could eat the **fruit**  of any tree except from the **tree of the knowledge of [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/good|good]] and [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/evil|evil]]**. God told us, ‘If you eat that fruit or even touch it, **you will [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/death|die]]**.’”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**fruit**  - We don't know what kind of fruit this was. We only know that it grew on this tree. If possible it is best to use a general word for fruit here, and not a word for a specific kind of fruit.
    * 


**tree of the knowledge of good and evil**  - The woman correctly understood that they were not allowed to eat from this one tree that would enable them to understand evil as well as good.
    * 


**you will die**  - Use your ordinary word for death, for a person's physical life to end. Don't avoid the term just because the thought of death sounds too harsh.
**[[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/sandbox/larrysallee/obs-training-text-and-notes#plugin_include__en__obs-training__frames__02-02|<<]] | [[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/02-sin-enters-the-world|Up]] | [[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/sandbox/larrysallee/obs-training-text-and-notes#plugin_include__en__obs-training__frames__02-04|>>]]**


===== The Lie [02-04] =====


{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-02-04.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=c651bc?nolink&640x360}}


The snake responded to the woman, “That is not **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/true|true]]**! You will not **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/death|die]]**. **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]]** just knows that as soon as you eat it, you will be **like God**  and will **understand [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/good|good]] and [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/evil|evil]]** like he does.”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**like God**  - The man and the woman were already made in the likeness of God. The snake is suggesting that the woman would be more like God if she understood evil. However, God never intended for her to have this knowledge.
    * 


**understand good and evil**  - To know from personal experience what things are good and what things are bad, or being able to know whether something is good or bad.
**[[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/sandbox/larrysallee/obs-training-text-and-notes#plugin_include__en__obs-training__frames__02-03|<<]] | [[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/02-sin-enters-the-world|Up]] | [[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/sandbox/larrysallee/obs-training-text-and-notes#plugin_include__en__obs-training__frames__02-05|>>]]**


===== Disobedience [02-05] =====


{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-02-05.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=d0ac00?nolink&640x360}}


The woman saw that the fruit was beautiful and looked delicious. She also wanted to be **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/wise|wise]]**, so she picked some of the fruit and ate it. Then she gave some to her husband, **who was with her**, and he ate it, too.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**wise**  - The woman wanted to have insight and understanding like the snake seemed to have, and like God has.
    * 


**who was with her**  - This is important information because it shows that the man was present when the woman made the decision to eat the fruit.
**[[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/sandbox/larrysallee/obs-training-text-and-notes#plugin_include__en__obs-training__frames__02-04|<<]] | [[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/02-sin-enters-the-world|Up]] | [[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/sandbox/larrysallee/obs-training-text-and-notes#plugin_include__en__obs-training__frames__02-06|>>]]**


===== Open Eyes [02-06] =====


{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-02-06.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=374d65?nolink&640x360}}


Suddenly, **their eyes were opened**, and they realized **they were naked**. They tried to **cover their bodies**  by sewing leaves together to make clothes.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**their eyes were opened**  - This could be translated as, “they saw things differently.” This expression means they now understood something for the first time. In your language, there may be an expression with similar meaning that you could use to translate this.
    * 


**realized they were naked**  - After the man and the woman disobeyed God, they felt ashamed that they were naked. That is why they used leaves to try to cover their naked bodies.
    * 


**cover their bodies**  - The man and the woman attempted to use leaves to hide themselves from God.
**[[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/sandbox/larrysallee/obs-training-text-and-notes#plugin_include__en__obs-training__frames__02-05|<<]] | [[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/02-sin-enters-the-world|Up]] | [[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/sandbox/larrysallee/obs-training-text-and-notes#plugin_include__en__obs-training__frames__02-07|>>]]**


===== Where Are You? [02-07] =====


{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-02-07.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=73c3c3?nolink&640x360}}


Then the man and his wife heard the sound of **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]] walking**through the garden. They both hid from God. Then God called to the man, “**Where are you?**” **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/adam|Adam]]** replied, “I heard you walking in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked. So I hid.”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**God walking**  - It seems that God regularly came to the garden to walk and talk with the man and the woman. We do not know what this looked like. If it is possible, it is best to use the same word that would be used to talk about a person walking.
    * 


**Where are you?**  - God already knew the answer to this question. The purpose of the question was to force the man and the woman to explain why they were hiding.
**[[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/sandbox/larrysallee/obs-training-text-and-notes#plugin_include__en__obs-training__frames__02-06|<<]] | [[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/02-sin-enters-the-world|Up]] | [[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/sandbox/larrysallee/obs-training-text-and-notes#plugin_include__en__obs-training__frames__02-08|>>]]**


===== The Blame [02-08] =====


{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-02-08.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=3e924d?nolink&640x360}}


Then **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]]** asked, “**Who told you that you were naked?**  Did you eat the fruit I told you not to eat?” The man answered, “You gave me this woman, and **she gave me the fruit**.” Then God asked the woman, “What have you done?” The woman replied, “**The snake tricked me**.”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**Who told you that you were naked?**  - Or, “How did you find out that you were naked?” God already knows the answer to all of his questions. By asking this question and the following question, he was giving Adam the opportunity to admit his sin of disobedience. Being naked was not a sin. God created them that way. Their knowledge of their nakedness was the problem. Their shame showed that they had sinned.
    * 


**she gave me the fruit**  - The man blamed the woman rather than confessing his disobedience and accepting responsibility for disobeying God.
    * 


**What have you done?**  - Or, “Why have you done this?” God already knew the answer to this question. By asking this question, he was giving the woman the opportunity to admit her guilt. He was also implying that she should not have done what she did.
    * 


**The snake tricked me**  - The snake deceived or misled her. He lied to her. Don't use a word that indicates that he cast a spell on her or bewitched her. The woman blamed the snake rather than confessing her disobedience and accepting responsibility for disobeying God.

===== God Cursed the Snake [02-09] =====


{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-02-09.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=4d4b5f?nolink&640x360}}


**[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]]** said to the snake, “**You are [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/curse|cursed]]**! You will slide on your belly and eat dirt. You and the woman will **hate each other**, and your children and her children will hate each other, too. The **woman’s [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/descendant|descendant]]** will **crush your head**, and you will **wound his heel**.”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**you are cursed**  - This could also be translated as, “I curse you” or, “Great harm will come to you.” Do not use a word that implies magic.
    * 


**hate each other**  - The woman would hate the snake and the snake would hate the woman. The women's descendants would also hate the snake's descendants, and the snake's descendants would hate them.
    * 


**woman's descendant**  - Refers to one of her descendants in particular.
    * 


**crush your head**  - The descendant of the woman will destroy the descendant of the snake.
    * 


**wound his heel**  - The descendant of the snake will wound the descendant of the woman.

**[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]]** then said to the woman, “I will make **childbirth very painful**  for you. You will desire your husband, and he will rule over you.”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**childbirth very painful**  - Some languages may need to express this as a verb. You could say, “I will cause you to have much more pain when you give birth to children.”

===== God Cursed the Man [02-11] =====


{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-02-11.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=facc7d?nolink&640x360}}


**[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]]** said to the man, “You listened to your wife and **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/disobey|disobeyed]]** me. Now the **ground is [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/curse|cursed]]**, and you will need to work hard to grow food. Then **you will [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/death|die]]**, and your body will **return to dirt**.” The man named his wife **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/eve|Eve]], which means “life-giver**,” because she would become the **mother of all people**. And God clothed **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/adam|Adam]]** and Eve with animal skins.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**ground is cursed**  - As punishment for Adam's disobedience, the earth would no longer be fruitful. Adam would have to work very hard to raise enough food to eat.
    * 


**you will die**  - The ultimate punishment for their disobedience was death. Spiritual death is our separation from God. Physical death is our separation from our body.
    * 


**return to dirt**  - God created Adam from the dirt or soil and gave him life. As a result of sin, his life will be taken from him and his body will decompose and become dirt again.
    * 


**Eve, which means 'life-giver'**  - God gave life to Adam and Eve, and it is passed on to every person through childbirth.
    * 


**mother of all people**  - This means that she would be the female ancestor of all people. Some languages say “she would be the grandmother of all people.”

Then **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]]** said, “Now that the human beings have become **like us by knowing [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/good|good]] and [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/evil|evil]]**, they must not be allowed to eat the **fruit**  of the **tree of [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/life|life]]** and live forever.” So God sent **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/adam|Adam]]** and **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/eve|Eve]]** away from the beautiful garden. God placed large, powerful **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/angel|angels]]** at the entrance to the garden to keep anyone from eating the fruit of the tree of life.


//A Bible story from: Genesis 3//


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**like us by knowing good and evil**  - Here, this phrase points to a new way that Adam and Eve would be like God. Because they had sinned, they were aware of evil and could experience it. You could say, “because now they knew both good and evil.”
    * 


**fruit**  - The specific kind of fruit is not revealed, so it is best to translate this using a general word for fruit.
    * 


**tree of life**  - This was an actual tree with fruit. See **[[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/sandbox/larrysallee/obs-training-text-and-notes#plugin_include__en__obs-training__frames__01-11|[01-11]]]**. If a person ate this fruit he would live continually and never die.

**After a long time**, many people were living in the world. They had become **very wicked and violent**. **It became so bad**  that **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]] decided to destroy**the whole world with a **huge flood**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**After a long time**  - This story happens many generations (hundreds of years) after creation.
    * 


**very wicked and violent**  - It may be more natural to say, “had become wicked and did violent things”.
    * 


**It became so bad**  – It may be clearer to say, “People were behaving in such harmful and evil ways that God.”
    * 


**God decided to destroy**  - This does not mean that the earth would be destroyed completely. Rather God planned to destroy all the people who had rebelled against him and who had caused such evil and violence. This flood would also kill all the land animals and the birds.
    * 


**huge flood**  - Very deep water that would cover the earth, even in places where the ground was normally dry, and even covering the tops of the highest mountains.

He was a **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/righteous|righteous]]** man, living among wicked people. God told Noah about the flood He was **planning to send**. He told Noah to build a huge boat.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**found favor**  - God was pleased with Noah because he feared and obeyed God. So even though Noah was not sinless, God was gracious to him and made a plan to rescue his family from the devastating flood. Make sure this doesn't sound like Noah was lucky or that he just happened to escape. Rather, it was God's choice.
    * 


**the flood**  - See how you translated this in **[[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/sandbox/larrysallee/obs-training-text-and-notes#plugin_include__en__obs-training__frames__03-01|[03-01]]]**.

**planning to send**  - God planned to cause deep water to cover the earth by sending a lot of rain. That is, he planned to cause the flood by causing a lot of rain to fall.

Noah was to build it with wood and to make three levels, many rooms, a roof, and a window. The boat would keep Noah, his family, and every kind of land animal safe during the flood.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**the boat**  - The boat was big enough to carry eight people, two of every kind of animal, and their provisions for almost a year.

==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**Noah warned**  - Noah told everyone that God planned to destroy the world because of sin.
    * 


**turn to God**  - This means that they should stop sinning and start obeying God.

===== The Animals Came [03-06] =====


{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-03-06.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=9cd025?nolink&640x360}}


**[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]] sent**a male and a female of every animal and bird to **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/noah|Noah]]** so they could go into the boat and be kept safe during the flood. God sent seven males and seven females of every type of animal that could be **used for [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/sacrifice|sacrifices]]**. When they were all in the boat, **God himself closed the door**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**God sent**  - Noah did not need to find the animals. God sent them to him.
    * 


**used for sacrifices**  - For some languages it may be better to say something like, “animals that were acceptable to sacrifice to God.” God had decided that people should sacrifice animals to him, but he only permitted them to sacrifice certain kinds of animals.
    * 


**God himself closed the door**  - This emphasizes that it was God who shut the door.

===== The Rain Began [03-07] =====


{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-03-07.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=b5349e?nolink&640x360}}


Then it began to **rain, and rain, and rain**. It rained for forty days and forty nights without stopping! Water also came **gushing**  up out of the earth. Everything in the **whole world was covered**  with water, even the highest mountains.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**rain, and rain, and rain**  - This emphasizes that there was an unusual, extreme amount of rain. Other languages may have a different way of emphasizing this.
    * 


**gushing**  - This indicates that there was a large amount of water coming out.
    * 


**whole world was covered**  - This refers to all the earth being covered with water from the flood.
**[[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/sandbox/larrysallee/obs-training-text-and-notes#plugin_include__en__obs-training__frames__03-06|<<]] | [[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/03-the-flood|Up]] | [[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/sandbox/larrysallee/obs-training-text-and-notes#plugin_include__en__obs-training__frames__03-08|>>]]**

{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-03-08.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=b8faf2?nolink&640x360}}


Everything that lived on the dry land **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/death|died]]**, except the people and animals that were in the boat. The boat floated on the water and kept everything inside the boat safe from drowning.

===== The Rain Stopped [03-09] =====


{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-03-09.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=dda725?nolink&640x360}}


After **the rains stopped**, the boat floated on the water for five months, and during this time the water started going down. Then one day the **boat rested**  on the top of a mountain, but the world was still covered with water. After **three more months**, the tops of the **mountains were visible**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**the rains stopped**  – This could be translated as, “it stopped raining.”
    * 


**boat rested**  - There was so much water from the rain that it covered the mountains. The ship floated over the mountains, and when the water started to go down, the ship went down with the water and settled on a mountain.
    * 


**three more months**  - During the next three months, the water continued to go down.
    * 


**mountains were visible**  - Other ways to translate this would be, “were showing” or, “appeared” or, “could be seen.” It may be more clear to say, “After three months, the water had gone down enough so that Noah and his family could clearly see the tops of the mountains.

===== The Raven [03-10] =====


{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-03-10.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=90750b?nolink&640x360}}


After forty more days, **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/noah|Noah]]** sent out a bird called a **raven**  to see if the water had dried up. The raven flew back and forth looking for dry land, but it could not find any.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**raven**  - A black bird that flies and eats a variety of plant and animal foods, including the rotting flesh of dead animals.
**[[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/sandbox/larrysallee/obs-training-text-and-notes#plugin_include__en__obs-training__frames__03-09|<<]] | [[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/03-the-flood|Up]] | [[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/sandbox/larrysallee/obs-training-text-and-notes#plugin_include__en__obs-training__frames__03-11|>>]]**


===== The Dove [03-11] =====


{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-03-11.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=1e0ae3?nolink&640x360}}


Later **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/noah|Noah]]** sent out a bird called a **dove**. But it also could not find any dry land, so it came back to Noah. A week later he sent the dove out again, and it came back with an **olive branch**  in its beak! **The water was going down**, and the plants were growing again!


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**dove**  - A small, white or gray flying bird that eats seeds or fruit.
    * 


**olive branch**  - An olive tree's fruit contains oil which people use for cooking or putting on their skin. If your language does not have a word for “olive branch,” you could translate it as, “branch from a tree called 'olive'” or, “branch from an oil-tree.”
    * 


**water was going down**  - It may be more natural in your language to say that, “the water was going away” or, “the level of the water was getting lower.”
**[[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/sandbox/larrysallee/obs-training-text-and-notes#plugin_include__en__obs-training__frames__03-10|<<]] | [[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/03-the-flood|Up]] | [[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/sandbox/larrysallee/obs-training-text-and-notes#plugin_include__en__obs-training__frames__03-12|>>]]**


===== Dry Land [03-12] =====


{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-03-12.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=48bad0?nolink&640x360}}


**[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/noah|Noah]]****waited another week**  and sent out the dove a third time. This time, it found a place to rest and did not come back. The water was drying up!


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**waited another week**  - You could say, “waited seven more days.” The word “waited” shows that Noah was allowing time for the floodwaters to go down before sending out the dove again.
**[[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/sandbox/larrysallee/obs-training-text-and-notes#plugin_include__en__obs-training__frames__03-11|<<]] | [[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/03-the-flood|Up]] | [[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/sandbox/larrysallee/obs-training-text-and-notes#plugin_include__en__obs-training__frames__03-13|>>]]**


===== Leaving the Boat [03-13] =====


{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-03-13.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=cb72e5?nolink&640x360}}


**Two months later [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]]** said to **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/noah|Noah]]**, “You and your family and all the animals may leave the boat now. **Have many children**  and grandchildren and **fill the earth**.” So Noah and his family came out of the boat.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**Two months later**  - This means two months after Noah released the dove from the ark. It may be necessary to say this explicitly if it is not clear.
    * 


**Have many children**  – To make sure it is clear that this was God's command and desire, you could say, “You must have many children.” or, “I want you to have many children.”
    * 


**fill the earth**  - If this is not clear, it may be necessary to say, “and fill the earth with people” or, “so that there will be many people living on the earth.”

===== Noah's Sacrifice [03-14] =====


{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-03-14.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=c4cd17?nolink&640x360}}


After **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/noah|Noah]]** got off the boat, he built an **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/altar|altar]]** and **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/sacrifice|sacrificed]]** some of each kind of **animal that could be used for a sacrifice**. **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]] was happy**with the sacrifice and **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/bless|blessed]]** Noah and his family.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**animal that could be used for a sacrifice**  - Another way to say this would be, “that people could use to sacrifice to him.”
    * 


**God was happy**  - God was pleased with Noah for sacrificing these animals.
**[[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/sandbox/larrysallee/obs-training-text-and-notes#plugin_include__en__obs-training__frames__03-13|<<]] | [[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/03-the-flood|Up]] | [[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/sandbox/larrysallee/obs-training-text-and-notes#plugin_include__en__obs-training__frames__03-15|>>]]**


===== God's Promise [03-15] =====


{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-03-15.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=8262a5?nolink&640x360}}


**[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]]** said, “I **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/promise|promise]]** I will **never again**  **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/curse|curse]]** the ground because of the **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/evil|evil]]** things that people do, or destroy the world by causing a flood, even though **people are [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/sin|sinful]] from the time they are children**.”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**never again**  - This means, “not ever again” or, “not again at any time” or, “truly not again”. Examples: “I will not ever again curse the ground” or, “I will not curse the ground again at any time” or, “I will truly not curse the ground again”.
    * 


**curse the ground**  - The earth and the other creatures suffered because of man's sin.
    * 


**the world**  – This refers to the earth and the living creatures that lived on it.
    * 


**people are sinful from the time they are children**  - Another way to say this would be, “people do sinful things their entire lives.”

{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-03-16.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=e95a50?nolink&640x360}}


**[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]]** then made the first **rainbow**  as **a sign of his [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/promise|promise]]**. **Every time**  the rainbow appeared in the sky, God would remember **what he promised**  and so would his people.


//A Bible story from: Genesis 6-8//


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**rainbow**  - This is the multicolored arc of light that often appears in the sky after a rainstorm.
    * 


**a sign**  - A sign is something (such as an object or event) that gives a certain meaning or which points to something that is true or will happen.
    * 


**as a sign of his promise**  – In some languages it may be better to say, “to show that he had promised.”
    * 


**Every time**  – Make sure it is clear that this means every time a rainbow appeared from that time on. It may be necessary to add, “From then on, every time.”
    * 


**what he promised**  - This refers back to the previous frame in which God promised to never again destroy the earth with a flood.
    * 


//A Bible story from//  - These references may be slightly different in some Bible translations.

{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-04-01.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=76c685?nolink&640x360}}


**Many years after the flood**, there were **again many people**  in the world, and they all spoke the **same language**. Instead of filling the earth as **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]]** had commanded, they gathered together and built **a city**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**many years after the flood**  - Many generations had passed since the end of the flood.
    * 


**again many people**  - Noah's family multiplied into enough people to fill a city.
    * 


**same language**  - This means there was only one language, so they could all understand each other.
    * 


**a city**  - It is best to use a general word for “city” since the text does not give a specific name.
**[[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/sandbox/larrysallee/obs-training-text-and-notes#plugin_include__en__obs-training__frames__03-16|<<]] | [[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/04-gods-covenant-with-abraham|Up]] | [[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/sandbox/larrysallee/obs-training-text-and-notes#plugin_include__en__obs-training__frames__04-02|>>]]**


===== The Tower [04-02] =====


{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-04-02.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=d4df27?nolink&640x360}}


They were very **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/proud|proud]]**, and they did not care about what **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]]** said. They even began building a **tall tower to reach [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/heaven|heaven]]**. God saw that if they all kept working together to do **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/evil|evil]]**, they could do many more **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/sin|sinful]]** things.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**tall tower to reach heaven**  - This structure was so tall that its top would be in the sky.
    * 


**heaven**  – This could be translated as, “sky.”
**[[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/sandbox/larrysallee/obs-training-text-and-notes#plugin_include__en__obs-training__frames__04-01|<<]] | [[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/04-gods-covenant-with-abraham|Up]] | [[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/sandbox/larrysallee/obs-training-text-and-notes#plugin_include__en__obs-training__frames__04-03|>>]]**


===== Many Languages [04-03] =====


{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-04-03.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=4be7b7?nolink&640x360}}


So **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]] changed their language**into **many different languages**  and **spread the people**  out all over the world. The city they had begun to build was called **Babel**, which means, “**confused**.”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**changed their language**  – In an instant, God miraculously gave them different languages to speak so that suddenly they were no longer able to understand each other.
    * 


**many different languages**  – Instead of one large group of people speaking one language, there were now many smaller people groups each speaking its own separate language.
    * 


**spread the people**  - When God changed their languages, he caused these groups of people to scatter out on the earth and each group moved to its own area.
    * 


**Babel**  - We don't know the exact location of this city, other than it was somewhere in the ancient Middle East.
    * 


**confused**  - This refers to how the people were confused or, “mixed-up” when they could no longer understand each other after God changed their language.

===== God Chose Abram [04-04] =====


{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-04-04.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=3ecee7?nolink&640x360}}


**Hundreds of years later, [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]]** spoke to a man named **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/abraham|Abram]]**. God told him, “**Leave your country**  **and family**  and go to the land I will show you. I will **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/bless|bless]]** you and **make you a great nation**. I will **make your name great**. I will bless those who bless you and **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/curse|curse]]** those who curse you. **All families on earth**  will be blessed because of you.”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**Hundreds of years later**  – This could be translated as, ”many generations after the people split into different language groups at Babel.” or, ”a long time after that happened.”
    * 


**Leave your country**  - This refers to the area where Abram was born and grew up (a region in Central Asia called “Ur”). It could be translated as, “native region” or, “homeland” or something similar.
    * 


**and family**  – God was calling Abram to leave behind most of his relatives. However, God was not telling Abram to abandon the people he was responsible for, including his wife.
    * 


**make you a great nation**  - God would cause Abram to have many descendants, and they would become a large and important nation or country.
    * 


**make your name great**  - This means that Abram's name and family would become well-known throughout the world and people would think well of them.
    * 


**all families on earth**  - Abram's decision to follow God would affect not only his own family, but also families from every people group on earth.

{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-04-05.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=42866c?nolink&640x360}}


So **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/abraham|Abram]]** **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/obey|obeyed]]** **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]]**. **He took**  his wife, **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/sarah|Sarai]]**, together with all of his **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/servant|servants]]** and everything he owned and went to the land **God showed him**, the **land of [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/canaan|Canaan]]**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**He took**  – Some languages would say, “He brought” here. Others would use two different verbs here, such as, “He caused his wife to come with him” and, “He brought along all of their servants and possessions.”
    * 


**God showed him**  - Somehow God made it clear to Abram where he was to go. The text doesn't tell how God showed him.
    * 


**land of Canaan**  - The name of this land was “Canaan”. This could be translated, “the land called Canaan.”

{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-04-06.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=4a51cc?nolink&640x360}}


When **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/abraham|Abram]]** arrived in **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/canaan|Canaan]]**, **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]]** said, “Look all around you. I will give to you and your **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/descendant|descendants]] all the land that you can see as an [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/inherit|inheritance]]**”. **Then Abram settled in the land**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**all the land that you can see**  - If Abram was standing on a mountain, he could have seen a very large area. On several occasions God promised to give the entire land of Canaan to Abram and his descendants.
    * 


**as an inheritance**  - God promised to give land to Abram and his descendants as a father gives land and possessions to his children.
    * 


**Then Abram settled in the land**  - Abram lived there along with all those who had gone there with him.

===== Melchizedek [04-07] =====


{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-04-07.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=c11abf?nolink&640x360}}


One day, **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/abraham|Abram]]** met **Melchizedek**, the **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/priest|priest]]** of **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God Most High]]**. Melchizedek **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/bless|blessed]]** Abram and said, “May God Most High who **owns [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/heaven|heaven]] and earth**bless Abram.” Then Abram gave Melchizedek a tenth of all he owned.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**Melchizedek**  - Melchizedek was the recognized religious authority in Canaan who received and presented offerings to God.

**God Most High**  - The people of Canaan worshiped many false gods. The title, “Most High God” explains that the God that Melchizedek worshiped was far superior to all of them, and was the same God that Abram worshiped.

==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**Many years**  - Several years had passed since God had first promised that Abram would have a son.
    * 


**as the stars in the sky**  - This expression means that Abram's descendants will be so many that no one can count them all.

A covenant is an agreement between **two parties**. God said, “I will give you a **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/son|son]] from your own body**. I give the land of **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/canaan|Canaan]]** to your **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/descendant|descendants]]**.” But Abram still **did not have a son**.


//A Bible story from: Genesis 11-15//


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**two parties**  - The parties could be two people, two groups of people, or a person and a group of people. In this case the agreement was between God and Abram.
    * 


**from your own body**  - With his own body Abram would cause his wife to become pregnant, so that together they would have their own, natural son. This was an amazing promise, since Abram and Sarai were very old.
    * 


**did not have a son**  - Abram still did not have any descendants who could possess the land.
    * 


//A Bible story from//  - These references may be slightly different in some Bible translations.

So Abram's wife, Sarai, said to him, “Since **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]]** has not allowed me to have children and now I am too old to have children, here is my **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/servant|servant]], [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/hagar|Hagar]]**. **Marry her also**  so she can **have a child for me**.”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**still did not have a child**  - Without a child, Abram had no descendants to become a great nation.
    * 


**Marry her also**  - Abram would take Hagar as a second wife, but Hagar would not have the full status of a wife as Sarai did. She was still Sarai's servant.
    * 


**have a child for me**  - Since Hagar was Sarai's servant, Sarai would be considered the mother of any children that Hagar bore.

Hagar had a baby boy, and Abram named him **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/ishmael|Ishmael]]**. But **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/sarah|Sarai]] became jealous of Hagar**. When Ishmael was thirteen years old, **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]]** again spoke to Abram.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**married**  - Hagar became Abram's concubine–a “second wife” of lower status. Hagar was still Sarai's servant.
    * 


**became jealous of Hagar**  - Sarai was jealous of Hagar because Hagar could have children and Sarai could not.

God said, “I am **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]]** Almighty. I will make a **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/covenant|covenant]]** with you.” Then **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/abraham|Abram]]** bowed to the ground. God also told Abram, “You will be the **father of many nations**. I will give you and your **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/descendant|descendants]]** the land of **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/canaan|Canaan]]** as their possession and **I will be their God**  forever. You must **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/circumcise|circumcise]]****every male in your family**.”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**father of many nations**  - Abram would have many descendants, and they would have their own lands and rule themselves. They and others would remember that Abram was their ancestor and would honor him.
    * 


**I will be their God**  - Another way to say this is, “I will be the God that they will worship.”
    * 


**every male in your family**  - This could be translated as, “every boy and man in your family.” This included Abram's servants and his descendants.

I will make **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/ishmael|Ishmael]]** a great nation, too, but my covenant will be with Isaac.” Then **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]]** changed **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/abraham|Abram's]]** name to **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/abraham|Abraham]]**, which means “**father of many**.” God also changed Sarai's name to **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/sarah|Sarah]]**, which means “**princess**.”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


(God continues to speak to Abram.)


    * 


**son of promise**  - Isaac would be the son that God promised to Sarai and Abram. He would also be the son that God would use to give Abram many descendants.
    * 


**I will make my covenant with him**  - This would be the same covenant that God made with Abram.
    * 


**father of many**  - As God had promised, Abraham would become the ancestor of many people who would even become many nations.
    * 


**princess**  - A princess is a daughter of a king. The names Sarai and Sarah apparently both meant “princess.” But God changed her name to signify that she would be the mother of many nations, and some of her descendants would be kings.

When **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/isaac|Isaac]]** was a young man, **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]] tested [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/abraham|Abraham's]] [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/faith|faith]]** by saying, “Take Isaac, your only **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/son|son]]**, and **kill him**  as a **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/sacrifice|sacrifice]]** to me.” Again Abraham **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/obey|obeyed]]** God and **prepared to sacrifice**  his son.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**God tested Abraham's faith**  - God wanted Abraham to show that he was completely submitted to God, that he would obey whatever God told him to do.
    * 


**kill him**  - God did not want human sacrifice. God wanted to see that Abraham loved God more than he loved his son and would obey God even when God told him to give his son back to God.
    * 


**prepared to sacrifice**  - Abraham got ready to sacrifice his son. God stopped him before he killed his son.

==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**walked to the place of sacrifice**  - God had told Abraham to sacrifice Isaac on a special high hill that was about three days' walk from where they lived.
    * 


**wood for the sacrifice**  - For a sacrifice, normally the lamb was killed and then placed on top of wood so that the wood and the lamb could be burned up with fire.
    * 


**the lamb**  - A young sheep or goat would be the normal animal for a sacrifice.
    * 


**provide**  - Abraham may have believed that Isaac was the “lamb” that God provided, although God fulfilled Abraham's words by providing a ram to sacrifice in Isaac's place.

After a long time, **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/abraham|Abraham]]** died and all of **the [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/promise|promises]] that [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]] had made to him in the [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/covenant|covenant]] were passed on**to **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/isaac|Isaac]]**. God had promised that Abraham would have **countless [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/descendant|descendants]]**, but Isaac's wife, **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/rebekah|Rebekah]]**, could not have children.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**the promises … were passed on**  - The promises of the covenant that God made with Abraham were not for him only, but also for his descendants.
    * 


**countless**  - This could also be translated as, “very many.” The word “countless” means there would be so many descendants that people would not be able to count them.

{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-06-05.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=83bdfc?nolink&640x360}}


**[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/isaac|Isaac]]** prayed for **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/rebekah|Rebekah]]**, and **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]]** allowed her to get pregnant with twins. The two babies struggled with each other while they were still **in Rebekah's womb**, so Rebekah asked God what was happening.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**in Rebekah's womb**  - That is, “inside her.”

===== Two Nations [06-06] =====


{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-06-06.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=134505?nolink&640x360}}


**[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]]** told **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/rebekah|Rebekah]]**, “Two nations will come **from the two sons**  inside of you. **They will struggle with each other**  and **the older [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/son|son]]** will **serve the younger one**.”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**from the two sons**  - That is, “from the descendants of the two sons.”
    * 


**They will struggle with each other**  - Both the two sons and the nations that will come from them will continually fight with each other. Compare to **[[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/sandbox/larrysallee/obs-training-text-and-notes#plugin_include__en__obs-training__frames__06-05|[06-05]]]**.
    * 


**the older son**  - Even though the babies were twins, the baby that came out first would be treated as the older son.
    * 


**serve the younger one**  – This could be translated as, “the older son will have to do what the younger one tells him to do.”
**[[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/sandbox/larrysallee/obs-training-text-and-notes#plugin_include__en__obs-training__frames__06-05|<<]] | [[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/06-god-provides-for-isaac|Up]] | [[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/sandbox/larrysallee/obs-training-text-and-notes#plugin_include__en__obs-training__frames__06-07|>>]]**


===== Twins Were Born [06-07] =====


{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-06-07.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=db8307?nolink&640x360}}


When **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/rebekah|Rebekah's]] babies were born**, **the older [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/son|son]]** came out **red**  and **hairy**, and they named him **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/esau|Esau]]**. Then **the younger son**  came out holding on to Esau's heel, and they named him **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/jacob|Jacob]]**.


//A Bible story from: Genesis 24:1-25:26//


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**Rebekah's babies were born**  - Some languages have a more indirect way of saying this such as, “when Rebekah saw and took them” or, “when Rebekah brought them to light.”
    * 


**the older son … the younger son**  - This could be translated as, “the first son to come out … the second son to come out.” Make sure that the way “older” and “younger” are translated still communicates that the boys were twins.
    * 


**red**  - This may mean that his skin was very red or that the hair on his body was red.
    * 


**hairy**  - Esau had a lot of hair on his body. You could say, “the older son's body was red, with lots of hair.”
    * 


//A Bible story from//  - These references may be slightly different in some Bible translations.

===== The Boys Grew Up [07-01] =====


{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-07-01.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=cbfa35?nolink&640x360}}


As the boys grew up, **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/jacob|Jacob]] loved to stay at home**, but **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/esau|Esau]] loved to hunt**. **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/rebekah|Rebekah]] loved Jacob**, **but [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/isaac|Isaac]] loved Esau**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**loved to stay at home … loved to hunt**  - Some languages will use a word for “love” here that is different from the one used for, “Rebekah loved Jacob.” For example, this could be translated as, “liked to stay at home … liked to hunt” or, “preferred to stay at home … preferred to hunt.”
    * 


**at home**  - This expression refers to the area around the family dwellings. Jacob preferred to stay close to the tents where they lived. Some languages have a special expression for, “at home.”
    * 


**Rebekah loved Jacob, but Isaac loved Esau**  - This could be translated as, “Rebekah was more fond of Jacob, and Isaac was more fond of Esau.” This does not necessarily mean that Rebekah and Isaac did not love the other son, but that each parent had a favorite.
**[[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/sandbox/larrysallee/obs-training-text-and-notes#plugin_include__en__obs-training__frames__06-07|<<]] | [[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/07-god-blesses-jacob|Up]] | [[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/sandbox/larrysallee/obs-training-text-and-notes#plugin_include__en__obs-training__frames__07-02|>>]]**


===== Esau Sold His Rights [07-02] =====


{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-07-02.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=a9d945?nolink&640x360}}


One day, when **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/esau|Esau]]** came back from hunting, he was very hungry. Esau said to **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/jacob|Jacob]]**, “Please **give me some of the food**  you have made.” Jacob responded, “First, **give me your rights as the oldest son**.” So Esau gave Jacob his **rights as the oldest son**. Then Jacob gave him some food.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**give me some of the food … give me your rights**  – Some languages may prefer to use two different words for “give” here. This would also apply to, “Esau gave … Jacob gave” in the last two sentences.
    * 


**rights as the oldest son**  - According to their custom, since Esau was the oldest son, he should have been the one to receive twice as much of their father's wealth when their father died. Jacob thought of a way to take these rights of the oldest son from Esau.
**[[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/sandbox/larrysallee/obs-training-text-and-notes#plugin_include__en__obs-training__frames__07-01|<<]] | [[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/07-god-blesses-jacob|Up]] | [[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/sandbox/larrysallee/obs-training-text-and-notes#plugin_include__en__obs-training__frames__07-03|>>]]**


===== Rebekah and Jacob Tricked Isaac [07-03] =====


{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-07-03.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=9d1775?nolink&640x360}}


**[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/isaac|Isaac]]** wanted to **give his [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/bless|blessing]]** to **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/esau|Esau]]**. But before he did, **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/rebekah|Rebekah]]** and **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/jacob|Jacob]] tricked him**by having Jacob **pretend**  to be Esau. Isaac was old and could no longer see. So Jacob put on Esau’s clothes and put **goatskins**  on his neck and hands.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**give his blessing**  - It was customary for fathers to formally express their desire for good things to happen to their children. Normally the older son received the best promise. Isaac wanted this extra prosperity to happen to Esau.
    * 


**tricked him**  - The word “trick” means to do something to deliberately deceive someone. Rebekah came up with a plan to deceive Isaac into giving Jacob the special blessing instead of Esau.
    * 


**pretend**  - The word “pretend” shows how Jacob would deceive his father (who had very poor eyesight in his old age).
    * 


**goatskins**  - The hairiness of the goatskins would make Jacob feel like Esau.

{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-07-04.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=2e97b5?nolink&640x360}}


**[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/jacob|Jacob]] came to [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/isaac|Isaac]]** and said, “I am **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/esau|Esau]]**. I have come so that you can **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/bless|bless]]** me.” When Isaac felt the goat hair and smelled the clothes, **he thought it was Esau**  and blessed him.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**Jacob came to Isaac**  - In some languages it might be more natural to say, “Jacob went to Isaac.”
    * 


**he thought it was Esau**  - He thought that the person he was touching and smelling was Esau.

{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-07-05.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=cd008d?nolink&640x360}}


**[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/esau|Esau]]** hated **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/jacob|Jacob]]** because Jacob had stolen his **rights as oldest son**  and also **his [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/bless|blessing]]**. So he planned to kill Jacob after their father died.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**rights as oldest son**  - Jacob found a way to get the larger portion of their father's wealth that should have gone to Esau as the older son. See also note on **[[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/sandbox/larrysallee/obs-training-text-and-notes#plugin_include__en__obs-training__frames__07-02|[07-02]]]**.
    * 


**his blessing**  - Jacob also tricked their father into giving him the promise of extra prosperity that Isaac intended to give to Esau.

{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-07-06.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=175ede?nolink&640x360}}


But **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/rebekah|Rebekah]]** heard of **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/esau|Esau’s]] plan**. So **she and [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/isaac|Isaac]] sent [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/jacob|Jacob]] far away to live with her relatives**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**Esau's plan**  - Esau's plan was to kill Jacob after his father died.
    * 


**she and Isaac sent Jacob**  – Rebekah wanted to protect Jacob from Esau so she talked to Isaac about sending Jacob away.
    * 


**far away to live with her relatives**  - This was the same place where Rebekah was living when Abraham's servant got her to be Isaac's wife. To make this clear, you could add, “relatives in the same land where she used to live.” The land was to the east, several hundred miles away.
    * 


**her relatives**  - This could also be translated as, “their relatives.” Since Abraham's brother was Rebekah's grandfather, her relatives were also Isaac's relatives.

==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**wealthy**  – This included money, large herds of animals and other possessions.

{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-07-08.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=3486cf?nolink&640x360}}


**After twenty years**  away from his home in **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/canaan|Canaan]]**, **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/jacob|Jacob]]** returned there with his family, his **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/servant|servants]]**, and all his herds of animals.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**after twenty years**  - Jacob had lived for twenty years in the land where his mother was from. If that is not clear you could say, “After twenty years living in the land where his relatives were.”

**[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/jacob|Jacob]]** was very afraid because he thought **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/esau|Esau]]** still wanted to kill him. So he sent many herds of animals to Esau as a gift. The **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/servant|servants]]** who brought the animals said to Esau, “**Your servant, Jacob**, is giving you these animals. He is coming soon.”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**your servant, Jacob**  - Jacob was not actually Esau's servant. But Jacob told his servants to say this because he wanted to show Esau that he was coming to him humbly and respectfully, so that Esau would no longer be angry with him.

//A Bible story from: Genesis 25:27-33:20//


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**lived peacefully**  - This refers to the fact that Esau and Jacob were not angry at each other and did not fight with each other.
    * 


**buried him**  - This could mean that they dug a hole in the ground, placed Isaac's body in it, and covered the hole with dirt or stones. Or it could mean that they placed Isaac's body in a cave and covered the opening.
    * 


**covenant promises**  - These were the promises that God made in his covenant with Abraham.
    * 


**passed on from Isaac to Jacob**  - The promises went from Abraham to his son Isaac, and now to Isaac's son Jacob. Esau did not receive the promises.

==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**sent**  – This word means that Jacob told Joseph to go and Joseph went.
    * 


**favorite son**  - This could be translated as, “the son he loved more than any of his other children.”
    * 


**check on**  - This means that Joseph is to go and see if everything is all right with his brothers. Some languages might say something like, “to see his brothers' well-being.”
    * 


**brothers**  - These were Joseph's older brothers.
    * 


**taking care of the herds**  – Since this was several days' journey away, it may be necessary to say, “who were far away taking care of.”

The **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/servant|slave]]** traders took **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/joseph|Joseph]]** to **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/egypt|Egypt]]**. Egypt was a large, powerful country located along the **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/nile-river|Nile River]]**. The slave traders sold Joseph as a slave to a wealthy **government official**. Joseph served his master well, and **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]]** **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/bless|blessed]]** Joseph.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**government official**  - This was a person who was part of the Egyptian government. Another way to say this would be, “a leader in Egypt's government.”

His master’s wife **tried to sleep with [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/joseph|Joseph]]**, but Joseph refused to **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/sin|sin]] against [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]]** in this way. She became angry and falsely accused Joseph so that he was arrested and sent to prison. Even in prison, Joseph **remained [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/faithful|faithful]] to God**, and God **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/bless|blessed]]** him.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**tried to sleep with Joseph**  – Another way to say this would be, “tried to seduce Joseph to have sex with her.” To “sleep with” is a way of expressing this in order not to be crude or offensive.
    * 


**sin against God**  - It is against God's law for people to have sex if they are not married to each other. Joseph did not want to sin by disobeying God's law.
    * 


**remained faithful to God**  - Another way to say this would be, “continued to obey God.”

===== Pharaoh's Dream [08-06] =====


{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-08-06.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=96601c?nolink&640x360}}


After two years, **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/joseph|Joseph]]** was still in prison, even though he was **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/innocent|innocent]]**. One night, the **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/pharaoh|Pharaoh]]**, which is what the **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/egypt|Egyptians]]** called their **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/king|kings]]**, had two **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/dream|dreams]]** that **disturbed him greatly**. None of **his advisors**  could tell him the **meaning of the dreams**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**disturbed him greatly**  – This means that the king felt very afraid and confused (because of what he had seen in the dreams).
    * 


**his advisors**  - These were men with special powers and knowledge who could sometimes tell what dreams meant. Some translations refer to them as, “wise men.”
    * 


**meaning of the dreams**  - People in Egypt believed that dreams were messages from the gods telling them about what would happen in the future. God used Pharaoh's dreams to tell him what would happen.

{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-08-07.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=6866a3?nolink&640x360}}


**[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]]** had given **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/joseph|Joseph]]** the ability to **interpret [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/dream|dreams]]**, so **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/pharaoh|Pharaoh]] had Joseph brought to him**from the prison. Joseph interpreted the dreams for him and said, “**God is going to send**  seven years of plentiful harvests, followed by seven years of **famine**.”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**interpret dreams**  - To “interpret” is to tell what something means. So Joseph was able to tell people what their dreams meant.
    * 


**had Joseph brought to him**  - Another way to say this would be, “ordered his servants to bring Joseph to him.”
    * 


**God is going to send**  - God will cause the crops to grow well for seven years, and after that He will cause them to produce very little food so that the people and animals will not have enough to eat.
    * 


**famine**  - The gardens and fields would produce so little food that people and animals would not have enough to eat.

{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-08-08.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=64f8a8?nolink&640x360}}


**[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/pharaoh|Pharaoh]]** was so **impressed with [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/joseph|Joseph]]** that he appointed him to be the **second most powerful man**  in all of **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/egypt|Egypt]]**!


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**impressed with**  - Pharaoh was amazed by Joseph's wisdom and felt respect for him; he trusted Joseph to make wise decisions that would benefit the people. It may be clearer to say, “impressed with Joseph's wisdom.”
    * 


**second most powerful man**  - Pharaoh made Joseph a very powerful and important ruler over all of Egypt. Only Pharaoh was more powerful and important than Joseph.

{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-08-09.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=cdb66c?nolink&640x360}}


**[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/joseph|Joseph]]** told the people to **store up large amounts of food**  during the seven years of good harvests. Then Joseph sold the food to the people when the seven years of **famine**  came so they would have enough to eat.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**store up large amounts of food**  - They took food from the abundant harvests to the cities and stored it there. The food then belonged to Pharaoh.
    * 


**famine**  - See how you translated this in **[[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/sandbox/larrysallee/obs-training-text-and-notes#plugin_include__en__obs-training__frames__08-07|[08-07]]]**.

{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-08-10.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=ab80d9?nolink&640x360}}


**The famine was severe**  not only in **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/egypt|Egypt]]**, but also in **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/canaan|Canaan]]** where **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/jacob|Jacob]]** and his family lived.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**Egypt, but also Canaan**  – For some languages it may be clearer or more natural to say, “the country of Egypt, but also the land of Canaan.”
    * 


**The famine was severe**  - The famine was very bad. There was very little food and many people outside of Egypt were starving.

{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-08-11.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=236cd3?nolink&640x360}}


So **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/jacob|Jacob]]** sent **his older sons**  to **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/egypt|Egypt]]** to buy food. The brothers **did not recognize [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/joseph|Joseph]]** when they stood before him to buy food. But Joseph recognized them.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**his older sons**  - These were Joseph's older brothers who had sold him into slavery.
    * 


**did not recognize Joseph**  - They did not know that the man was Joseph, because now Joseph was much older than when they last saw him, and he was dressed as an Egyptian ruler.

{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-08-12.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=ffa3c0?nolink&640x360}}


After **testing his brothers**  to see **if they had changed**, **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/joseph|Joseph]]** said to them, “I am your brother, Joseph! **Do not be afraid**. You tried to do **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/evil|evil]]** when you sold me as a **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/servant|slave]]**, but **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]]** used the **evil for [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/good|good]]**! Come and live in **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/egypt|Egypt]]** so I can provide for you and your families.”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**testing his brothers**  - Joseph placed his older brothers in a difficult situation to see if they would protect their youngest brother, or treat him as badly as they had treated Joseph. When they protected their youngest brother, Joseph knew they had changed.
    * 


**if they had changed**  - Another way to say this would be, “if they were different than they used to be.” Years ago Joseph's brothers sold him into slavery. Joseph wanted to find out if they would now do what was right.
    * 


**do not be afraid**  - Another way to say this would be, “You do not need to fear any punishment from me.” Joseph's brothers were afraid because they had greatly wronged Joseph and now as a great ruler he had the power to punish them. Joseph could refuse to sell them food, or even put them in prison or kill them.
    * 


**evil for good**  - Joseph's brothers did an evil thing when they sold Joseph as a slave and he was taken to Egypt. But God allowed this so that Joseph could save thousands of people from starving during the famine, including his own family. This was a very good thing.

When **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/joseph|Joseph's]]** brothers returned home and told their father, **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/jacob|Jacob]]**, that Joseph was still alive, he was very happy.

==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**Even though Jacob was an old man, he moved to Egypt**  - Egypt was a great distance away from Canaan, and it would have been difficult for an elderly man to walk or ride a cart that far.
    * 


**Before Jacob died**  - Jacob died in Egypt. He did not get to return to Canaan, the land God had promised to give to him and his descendants.

The **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/descendant|descendants]]** of the twelve sons became the **twelve tribes of [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/israel|Israel]]**.


//A Bible story from: Genesis 37-50//


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**covenant promises**  - Long ago God made an agreement with Abraham and promised him that he would give him many descendants; they would possess the land of Canaan and become a great nation. God also promised that all peoples would be blessed through Abraham's line. See also **[[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/sandbox/larrysallee/obs-training-text-and-notes#plugin_include__en__obs-training__frames__07-10|[07-10]]]**.
    * 


**passed on to**  - Another way to say this would be, “passed down to” or, “given to” or, “applied to.” God's promise to Abraham was also for Abraham's children, grandchildren and all the rest of his descendants. See also **[[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/sandbox/larrysallee/obs-training-text-and-notes#plugin_include__en__obs-training__frames__06-04|[06-04]]]**.
    * 


**twelve tribes of Israel**  - God had promised Abraham, Isaac and Jacob that their descendants would become a great nation. God later changed Jacob's name to Israel. The descendants of Jacob's 12 sons became 12 great tribes. These 12 tribes made up the ancient nation called Israel, which was named by Jacob's new name.

After hundreds of years, the number of **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/israel|Israelites]]** had become very large. The **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/egypt|Egyptians]]** no longer remembered **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/joseph|Joseph]]** and all he had done to help them.

    * 


**Pharaoh**  – “Pharaoh” is an Egyptian word that refers to their king. This Pharaoh was probably the son of a former Pharaoh who had died, who may have been a descendant of the Pharaoh that Joseph knew.
    * 


**made the Israelites slaves**  - That is, “forced the Israelites to do hard labor against their will and treated them very harshly.”

**miserable**  – This means that they suffered terribly because of how harshly they were treated and how hard they were forced to work. They also felt very discouraged.

A daughter of **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/pharaoh|Pharaoh]]** saw the basket and looked inside. When she saw the baby, she **took him as her own [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/son|son]]**. She hired an **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/israel|Israelite]]** woman **to nurse him**  without realizing the woman was the baby’s own mother. When the child was old enough that he no longer needed his mother's milk, she returned him to Pharaoh’s daughter, who named him **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/moses|Moses]]**.


==== Translation Notes: ====

**took him as her own son**  - She was a princess. When she made him her son, he became a prince of Egypt.

    * 


**grown up**  - Another way to say this would be, “grown into a man.”
    * 


**fellow Israelite**  - This phrase refers to the Israelite slave. The word “fellow” here indicates that Moses was also an Israelite. Although the daughter of the Egyptian Pharaoh raised Moses, Moses remembered that he was really an Israelite.

One day while **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/moses|Moses]]** was **taking care of his [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/sheep|sheep]]**, he saw a bush that was on fire. But the **bush did not burn up**. Moses went towards the bush to be able to see it better. As he approached the burning bush, **the voice of [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]] said**, “Moses, **take off your shoes**. You are standing on **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/holy|holy]] ground**.”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**taking care of his sheep**  - This means he was doing the work of a shepherd to guide the sheep to grass and water, and to protect them. It could be translated as, “tending the sheep.”
    * 


**bush did not burn up**  - God made the bush full of fire, but the fire did not damage the bush.
    * 


**the voice of God said**  - This could be translated as, “God said out loud.” Moses heard God speak, but he did not see God.
    * 


**take off your shoes**  - God wanted him to take off his shoes to show that he greatly respected God. To make clear the reason for this, you could say, “take off your shoes, because you are on holy ground.”
    * 


**holy ground**  - It was holy in the sense that God set it apart from the ordinary land and made it to be a special place where He would reveal Himself.

**suffering of my people**  - This could be translated as, “the very harsh treatment that my people are experiencing. Some languages might translate this as, “how the Egyptians are giving my people terrible pain.”
    * 


**my people**  - This refers to the Israelites. God had made a covenant with Abraham and his descendants that He would bless them and make them into a great nation. Through this covenant, the Israelites became God's own people.
    * 


**bring … out of their slavery in Egypt**  - This can be translated as, “set them free from being slaves in Egypt” or, “bring them out of Egypt where they are now slaves.”

    * 


**I AM WHO I AM**  - This description shows that God can only be defined by himself, not by anything else that we know of, and he cannot be compared to anyone else.
    * 


**I AM**  - This name emphasizes that God is the only one who has always lived and always will live.
    * 


**my name**  - The name that God told Moses and all of Israel to use for him is “Yahweh,” which is related to “I AM” and appears to mean, “HE IS.”

{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-09-15.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=17b434?nolink&640x360}}


**[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/moses|Moses]] was afraid and did not want to go**to **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/pharaoh|Pharaoh]]** because he thought he could not speak well, so **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]]** sent **Moses’ brother, [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/aaron|Aaron]]**, to help him. God warned Moses and Aaron that Pharaoh would be **stubborn**.


//A Bible story from: Exodus 1-4//


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**was afraid and did not want to go**  - Moses knew that Pharaoh wanted to kill him, and he did not believe that he could do what God wanted him to do.
    * 


**Moses' brother, Aaron**  - Aaron was Moses's actual brother from his Israelite mother and father. Aaron would have been at least several years older than Moses.
    * 


**stubborn**  - This means the Pharaoh would refuse to obey God. You may also want to add, “stubborn and refuse to listen (or obey).”
    * 


//A Bible story from//  - These references may be slightly different in some Bible translations.

Instead of letting the **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/israel|Israelites]]** go free, he forced them to work even harder!


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**to Pharaoh**  – It may be clearer to say, “to Pharaoh's palace to talk to him.”
    * 


**God of Israel**  - This could be translated as, “God, who chose the Israelites to be his people” or, “God, who rules the people of Israel” or, “the God whom the Israelites worship.”

{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-10-02.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=735543?nolink&640x360}}


**[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/pharaoh|Pharaoh]]** kept refusing to let **the people**  go, so **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]]** sent **ten terrible plagues**  on **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/egypt|Egypt]]**. Through these plagues, God showed Pharaoh that he is more powerful than Pharaoh and **all of Egypt's [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god-false|gods]]**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**the people**  - This refers to the people of Israel, also called, “the Israelites.”
    * 


**ten terrible plagues**  - A plague is something very bad or terrible that happens to someone or something. A plague usually refers to something that affects many people or happens over a large geographic area. Another word for “plague” would be “disaster.”
    * 


**all of Egypt's gods**  - It may be more clear to say, “all the gods that the Egyptian people worshiped.” The people of Egypt worshiped many different false gods. These false gods were either spirit beings that the God of Israel created, or they did not actually exist.

==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**turned the Nile River into blood**  - Some languages may need to say, “turned the water in the Nile River into blood.” Instead of water in the river there was blood, so the fish died and the people had no water to drink.

**God sent frogs all over Egypt**  - This could be translated as, “God caused many frogs to appear throughout Egypt.”

==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**God sent a plague**  – This could be translated as, “God caused there to be a plague” or, “God caused a plague (of gnats) to come over the land of Egypt.”
    * 


**gnats**  - These were tiny, biting insects flying in large swarms, annoying and landing on all the people and animals of Egypt.

==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**God sent darkness**  - God caused darkness to cover or spread over most of Egypt. In other words, God took away the light from this part of Egypt.
    * 


**darkness that lasted for three days**  - This darkness was darker than ordinary nighttime darkness, and it continued to be totally dark for three whole days.

Even after **these nine plagues**, **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/pharaoh|Pharaoh]]** still refused to let the **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/israel|Israelites]]** go free. **Since Pharaoh would not listen**, **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]]** planned to send one last plague. **This would change Pharaoh’s mind**.


//A Bible story from: Exodus 5-10//


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**these nine plagues**  - This means, “these nine disasters that God had caused.”

**Since Pharaoh would not listen**  - This could be translated as, “Since Pharaoh would not do what God was telling him to do” or, “Since Pharaoh refused to obey God.”

When Pharaoh heard this he still refused to **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/believe|believe]]** and **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/obey|obey]]** God.


==== Translation Notes: ====

**the firstborn males of both people and animals**  - This could be translated as, “the eldest son in every family and the first male offspring of any of their animals.”

==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**God provided**  – God is the only one who could provide the way to save the Israelites' sons from death.

**perfect lamb**  - That is, “a young sheep or goat that had no blemishes or defects.”

He also told them to be ready to leave **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/egypt|Egypt]]****when they ate**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**made without yeast**  – Yeast is something that is mixed into bread dough to make bread rise as it cooks. This could be translated as, “made without something that would make it rise.” Making the bread with yeast would have taken much longer, so cooking the bread without yeast was a way to be prepared to leave Egypt quickly.
    * 


**when they ate**  – This means they needed to be prepared to leave before they started to eat.

The **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/israel|Israelites]]** did everything just as **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]]** had commanded them to do. In the middle of the night, God went throughout **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/egypt|Egypt]]** killing **every firstborn son**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**every firstborn son**  - This means every firstborn son of families who had not made the blood sacrifice, that is, the Egyptians. To make this clear you may want to add, “Every Egyptian firstborn son” (since all the Israelite families had put the blood on their doorposts).

All the houses of the **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/israel|Israelites]]** had **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/blood|blood]]** around the doors, so **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]]****passed over**  those houses. Everybody inside them was safe. **They were [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/save|saved]] because of the [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/lamb|lamb's]] blood**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**passed over**  - This means that God passed by those houses and did not stop to kill anyone there. This phrase became the name of the Jewish festival, “Passover.”
    * 


**They were saved**  - God did not kill their firstborn son.
    * 


**because of the lamb's blood**  - This could be translated as, “because the lamb's blood was on their door.” God saw that they had killed their lamb as he had commanded, so he did not kill their son.

==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**did not believe God or obey his commands**  – In some languages it may be more natural or clear to say, “did not believe God and so they did not obey his commands.”
    * 


**did not pass over**  - He did not pass by their houses. Rather he stopped at each house and killed their eldest son.

Many people in **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/egypt|Egypt]]** were crying and wailing because of their deep sadness.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**from the firstborn of the prisoner in jail, to the firstborn of Pharaoh**  - This is a way of saying that everyone's firstborn son died–from the son of the least important person to the son of the most important person, and everyone in between.

//A Bible story from: Exodus 11:1-12:32//


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**called for**  – This means that Pharaoh told his servants to tell Moses and Aaron to come to him.

Some people from other nations **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/believe|believed]]** in **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]]** and went along with the Israelites as they left Egypt.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**They were no longer slaves**  - This could be translated as, “They were not slaves anymore.”
    * 


**going**  – Some languages may use a more specific word like “traveling” since they would be going a long distance to the Promised Land.
    * 


**Promised Land**  - This is the land that God had promised that he would give to Abraham's descendants.

    * 


**tall pillar of cloud**  - This could be translated as, “a tall cloud” or, “a cloud shaped like a pillar.”

==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**After a short time**  – Probably at least two days had gone by. For that to be clear, it may be translated as, “After a few days” or, “A few days after the Israelites left Egypt.”
    * 


**changed their minds**  - This phrase means, “began to think differently than they had before.” Some languages may not have this same expression, and will express the meaning in a direct way.

They were very afraid and cried out, “**Why did we leave [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/egypt|Egypt]]**? We are going to die!”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**they were trapped between…Red Sea**  - Another way to say this would be, “there was nowhere they could go to escape since the Egyptians were behind them and the Red Sea was in front of them.”
    * 


**Why did we leave Egypt?**  – This means, “We should not have left Egypt!” They were not really asking for reasons. Because they were afraid, in this moment they were wishing they had not left Egypt (even though it had been very difficult for them there).

**God will fight for you today and save you**  - Another way to say this would be, “Today God will defeat the Egyptians for you and keep them from harming you.”

**[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]]** told **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/moses|Moses]]** to **raise his hand over the sea**  and divide the waters. Then God caused wind to push the water in the sea to the left and the right, so that a path formed through the sea.


==== Translation Notes: ====

**raise his hand over the sea**  - This could be translated as, “held out his hand over the sea”. This was a gesture to show that God was doing this miracle through Moses.

They celebrated by killing a **perfect [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/lamb|lamb]]**, eating it with **unleavened bread**.


//A Bible story from: Exodus 12:33-15:21//


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**the Passover**  - This could be translated as, “the Passover activities” or, “the Passover celebration” or, “the Passover meal.”
    *

This was the same mountain where **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/moses|Moses]]** had seen the **burning bush**. The people **set up their tents**  at the **base of the mountain**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**burning bush**  - Before Moses returned to Egypt, God had spoken to him from a shrub that was on fire, but that was not burned up by the fire. See **[[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/sandbox/larrysallee/obs-training-text-and-notes#plugin_include__en__obs-training__frames__09-12|[09-12]]]**.
    * 


**set up their tents**  - The Israelites had to travel a great distance from Egypt to the Promised Land. So they took tents with them so that they could set them up as shelters and sleep in them along the way. Some languages could translate this as, “hung their tents.”
    * 


**base of the mountain**  – This could be translated as, “bottom of the mountain.” This refers to the area of land that is located next to the place where the ground starts to slant upward to form a mountain.

{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-13-02.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=c8d4e3?nolink&640x360}}


**[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]]** said to **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/moses|Moses]]** and the people of **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/israel|Israel]]**, “If you will **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/obey|obey]]** me and **keep my [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/covenant|covenant]]**, **you will be my prized possession**, a **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/kingdom|kingdom]] of [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/priest|priests]]**, and a **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/holy|holy]] nation**.”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**keep my covenant**  - This could be translated as, “do what my covenant requires you to do.” Obeying and keeping the covenant are not two different things. One way to make this clear would be to say, “obey me by keeping my covenant.” God will soon tell them what his covenant requires.
    * 


**my prized possession**  - This could be translated as, “You will be my possession that I value most” or, “You will be the people that I treasure more than any other group of people” or, “You will be my own precious people.”
    * 


**You will be…a kingdom of priests**  - This could be translated as, “I will be your king and you will be like priests.” The Israelites were supposed to teach the other nations about God and be a mediator between God and the nations just as there were priests in the nation of Israel to go between God and the Israelites.

==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**Three days later**  - In other words, three days after they arrived at Mount Sinai and God first spoke to them.
    * 


**prepared themselves spiritually**  - This refers to ceremonial cleansing in preparation to meet with God. This could be translated as, “got ready to meet with God” or, “prepared themselves to meet with God.”
    * 


**loud trumpet blast**  - This could be translated as, “and a loud sound came from a horn” or, “and a horn was blown and it made a loud sound” or, “and they heard the loud sound of a horn blowing.” Trumpets were made out of ram's horns. They were used that day to call the people to gather at the mountain and meet with God.
    * 


**Only Moses was allowed to go up**  - This could be translated as, “God permitted Moses to go up, but he did not permit anyone else to go up.”

**Then [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]] gave them the [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/covenant|covenant]] and said**, “I am **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/yahweh|Yahweh]], your God**, **who [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/save|saved]] you from [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/servant|slavery]]** in **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/egypt|Egypt]]**. Do not **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/worship|worship]]** other **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god-false|gods]]**.”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**Then God gave them the covenant and said**  - What God says next is the content of the covenant, that is, he tells the people the things that they must obey. This could be translated as, “Then God told them His covenant. He said” or, “Then God made this covenant with them:”
    * 


**Yahweh your God**  - In some languages it might be more natural to change the order and say “your God Yahweh.” Make sure it does not sound like the Israelites had more than one God. It should be clear that Yahweh is the only God. Another way to translate this would be, “Yahweh, who is your God” or, “your God, whose name is Yahweh.”
    * 


**who saved you from slavery**  - This could be translated as, “I freed you from slavery.”

{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-13-05.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=b6c633?nolink&640x360}}


“Do not make **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/idol|idols]]** and do not **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/worship|worship]]** them, because **I, [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/yahweh|Yahweh]], am a jealous [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]]**. **Do not use my name in a disrespectful way**.

That is, do all your work in six days, for the **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/sabbath|seventh day]]** is a day for you to rest and **to remember me**.”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


(God continues speaking to Moses.)


    * 


**I, Yahweh, am a jealous God**  - This could be translated as, “I, Yahweh, will be angry if you worship or honor anything besides me.” God strongly desires that his people love, serve, and obey Him more than anything or anyone else. He must be the only master of their lives.
    * 


**Do not use my name in a disrespectful way**  - This could be translated as, “Do not talk about me in a way that does not show respect and honor” or, “Talk about me in a way that gives me proper respect and honor.”
    * 


**seventh day**  - To translate this, it is best to use the number (“seventh”) rather than give the name of a specific day of the week.
    * 


**to remember me**  - This could be translated as, “to keep me in mind” or, “to honor me.”

**Do not lie**  - This means, “Do not say false things about other people.”

Only the **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/priest-high|high priest]]** was allowed to go into **the room behind the curtain**, because **God lived there**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**a detailed description**  - This could be translated as, “God described it in detail” or, “God told them exactly how He wanted them to make it.”
    * 


**It was called**  - This could be translated as, “They called it” or, “Moses called it.”
    * 


**the room behind the curtain**  - This room was hidden by the curtain. Some languages would call this room, “the room in front of the curtain.”
    * 


**God lived there**  - If this phrase would lead people to think that God was limited to living in the tent, here are some ways of translating it: “God was there” or, “God revealed Himself to humans there.”

A **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/priest|priest]]** would kill the animal and burn it on the **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/altar|altar]]**. **The [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/blood|blood]] of the animal that was sacrificed covered the person’s [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/sin|sin]]** and made that person **clean in God's sight**.

    * 


**to the Tent of Meeting**  - They did not bring the animal inside the Tent of Meeting, but to the altar in front of the Tent of Meeting. Be sure not to use an expression that means that they brought it inside.
    * 


**covered the person’s sin**  - When people brought animals to sacrifice, God chose to see the blood of the animals as a covering over their sin. This is like hiding something that is ugly or dirty by covering it.
    * 


**clean in God's sight**  - This could be translated as, “as if he did not have the sin according to God” or, “free of the punishment for breaking God's law.”

    * 


**listened to his prayer**  - God always hears prayer. In this situation, “listened” means that God agreed to do what Moses asked.

    * 


**get rid of**  - This could be translated as, “get them out of the land” or, “remove them from the land.”
    * 


**Do not make peace with them**  - This could be translated as, “Do not live peacefully among or alongside them” or, “Do not promise to live peacefully with them.”
    * 


**do not marry them**  - God did not want any Israelite person to marry any Canaanite person.
    * 


**you will worship their idols**  - If the Israelites became friends with the Canaanites and did not destroy the idols, they would be tempted to worship those idols instead of God. You could say, “you will end up worshiping” to make it clear that this would result from living so close to the Canaanites and learning their ways.

==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**spy on the land**  - This could be translated as, “secretly get information about the land” or, “secretly learn about the land.” Part of the spies' task was to find out what kinds of food the land could produce.

**spy on the Canaanites**  - This could be translated as, “secretly get information about the people of Canaan” or, “secretly learn about the Canaanites.”
    * 


**to see if they were strong or weak**  - They wanted to know if the Canaanites were prepared to fight against them. This could be translated as, “to find out how powerful the Canaanite armies were.”

==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**they came back**  - They returned to where the rest of the Israelites were waiting, just outside the border of Canaan.
    * 


**The cities are very strong**  - The cities had strong walls around them, so it would be very difficult for the Israelites to attack them.
    * 


**the people are giants**  – This could be translated as, “the people are like giants compared to us!” or, “the people are much taller and stronger than we are!”

**people of Canaan**  – This could be translated as, “the people who live in Canaan” or, “the Canaanites.”
    * 


**we can certainly defeat them! God will fight for us**  – To show the connection between these two statements, it may be necessary to say, “we can certainly defeat them because God will fight for us!”
    * 


**God will fight for us**  – This could be translated as, “God will fight alongside us and help us defeat them!” This makes it clear that the Israelites would also be fighting against the Canaanites.

    * 


**Why did you bring us**  – This is not a real question. It is a way that some languages use to say, “You should not have brought us.”

**rather than be killed in battle and our wives and children made slaves**  - This could be translated as, “If we fight against the Canaanites, they will kill us men and force our wives and children to be their slaves.”

==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**God provided for them**  – This could be translated as, “God gave them everything they needed for food, water, and shelter.”

**bread from heaven, called “manna”**  - This thin, bread-like food fell from the sky overnight onto the grass like dew. They called it “manna.” Almost every day the people gathered this “manna” and cooked it as their food.
    * 


**He also sent flocks of quail…camp**  - Another way to say this would be, “He also caused a large number of quails to fly into their camp.” If quails are unknown, a different, similar type bird could be used. Or it could be translated as, “a large number of medium-sized birds.”
    * 


**their camp**  - The place where the Israelites set up their tents to sleep in was called a “camp.” It was like a city with tents instead of buildings, and it could be moved around.

{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-15-08.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=12a399?nolink&640x360}}


So **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/joshua|Joshua]]** gathered the **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/israel|Israelite]]** army and they marched all night **to reach the [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/gibeon|Gibeonites]]**. In the early morning **they surprised the [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/amorite|Amorite]] armies**and attacked them.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**to reach the Gibeonites**  - That is, “to get to the Gibeonites” or, “to arrive at where the Gibeonites lived.” The Gibeonites lived in Canaan, but Canaan is big enough that it took all night for the Israelite army to travel from their camp to where the Gibeonites were.
    * 


**they surprised the Amorite armies**  - The Amorites did not know that the Israelites were coming to attack them.

==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**God fought for Israel**  - God fought on the side of Israel against Israel's enemies.
    * 


**caused the Amorites to be confused**  - This could be translated as, “made the Amorites panic” or, “caused the Amorites to be unable to fight together well.”
    * 


**large hailstones**  - This could be translated as, “very large balls of ice to come down from the sky.”

**When [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/joshua|Joshua]] was an old man**, he called all the people of **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/israel|Israel]]** together.

//A Bible story from: Joshua 1-24//


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**When Joshua was an old man**  – It may be clearer to say, “Many years later, when Joshua was an old man.” Joshua was over 100 years old at this time.
    * 


**remain faithful to God**  - In other words, they would be loyal to God. They would worship and serve only God; they would not worship or serve any other gods.
    * 


**follow his laws**  - This means that the people would obey the laws that God had given them already as part of the covenant.
    * 


//A Bible story from//  - These references may be slightly different in some Bible translations.

==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**and did not drive out**  – This tells how they disobeyed God, so in some languages it may be better to start this as a new sentence, “They did not.”
    * 


**drive out the rest of the Canaanites**  - This can be translated, “fight with the rest of the Canaanites to force them to leave the land.”
    * 


**or obey God's laws**  - This means that the people also disobeyed the laws that God gave to the Israelites at Mount Sinai.
    * 


**the true God**  - That is, “the only real God.” Yahweh is the only one that people should worship.
    * 


**what they thought was right for them**  – This means that they all did whatever they wanted to do, including many evil things.

==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**God provided**  - This could be translated as, “God chose” or, “God appointed” or, “God raised up.”
    * 


**brought peace**  - This could be translated as, “allowed the people to live without fear” or, “ended the fighting” or, “stopped their enemies from attacking them.”
    * 


**the land**  - That refers to Canaan, the Promised Land that God had given to Abraham.
    * 


**the people forgot about God**  - This means, “The people stopped thinking about God and ignored what he had commanded them.”

===== An Angel Spoke to Gideon [16-05] =====


{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-16-05.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=0d43ae?nolink&640x360}}


**One day**, a man of Israel named **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/gideon|Gideon]]** was **threshing grain secretly**  so the **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/midian|Midianites]]** would not steal it. The **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/angel|angel]]** of **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/yahweh|Yahweh]]** came to Gideon and said, “**[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]] is with you**, mighty warrior. Go and save **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/israel|Israel]]** from the Midianites.”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**One day**  - This phrase introduces an event that happened in the past, but does not state the specific time. Many languages have a similar way to begin telling a true story.
    * 


**threshing grain**  - The grain was wheat, which has a head of many small grains, or seeds, on the top of a thin stalk. “Threshing” is separating the seeds of the plant from the stalks by beating the heads of grain. The seeds are food, but the stalks are not.
    * 


**secretly**  - Gideon was threshing the grain in a hidden location, so the Midianites would not see him.
    * 


**God is with you**  – This means, “God is present with you in a special way” or, “God has plans to use you in a special way.”

He built a new altar to God near where the altar to the idol used to be and made a **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/sacrifice|sacrifice]]** to God on it.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**to tear down**  - This means, “to violently bring down” or, “to take down and destroy.”
    * 


**afraid of the people**  - Gideon was afraid that his fellow Israelites who worshiped the same idol would be angry with him.
    * 


**waited until nighttime**  - Another way to say this would be, “waited until after dark.” Gideon smashed the altar at night when everyone was asleep so that no one would see him do it.

==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**Why are you trying to help your god?**  - This is not a real question that asks for information. Another way of saying this would be, “You should not be trying to help your god” or, “You should not need to help your god.”
    * 


**If he is a god, let him protect himself**  - This means, “If he were truly a god, he would be able to defend himself.”

So Gideon sent home 22,000 who were afraid to fight. God told Gideon that he still had too many men. So Gideon sent all of them home **except for 300 soldiers**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**32,000 Israelite soldiers came to Gideon**  - Some languages might need to insert the following sentence at the beginning of the story: “Gideon called the Israelites to come fight against the Midianites.” See **[[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/sandbox/larrysallee/obs-training-text-and-notes#plugin_include__en__obs-training__frames__16-08|[16-08]]]**.
    * 


**too many**  - This was more soldiers than God wanted for this fight. If that many solders fought and won, they would think that they won the battle with their own strength, and they would not know that God did it.

The man’s friend said, “This dream means that Gideon's army will defeat the Midianite army!” When Gideon heard this, he **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/worship|worshiped]]** God.


==== Translation Notes: ====

They surrounded the camp where the **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/midian|Midianite]]** soldiers were sleeping. Gideon's 300 men soldiers had the torches in the pots so the Midianites could not see the light of the torches.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**horn**  - This could be translated as, “trumpet” or, “ram's horn trumpet.” These horns came from a male sheep and were often used to call men for battle.
    * 


**a torch**  - This was probably a piece of wood wrapped with cloth and soaked in oil so that it could burn well. (This was not the modern torch that runs on batteries.)

Then, all of **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/gideon|Gideon's]]** soldiers broke their pots at the same moment, suddenly revealing the fire of the torches. They blew their horns and **shouted**, “**A sword for [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]] and for Gideon**!”

    * 


**A sword for God and for Gideon**  - This means, “We fight for God and for Gideon!”

{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-19-03.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=eb8dac?nolink&640x360}}


**[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]]** told **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/elijah|Elijah]]** to go to a stream in **the wilderness**  to hide from Ahab who wanted to kill him. Every morning and every evening, birds would bring him bread and meat. **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/ahab|Ahab]]** and his army looked for Elijah, but they could not find him. **The drought**  was so severe that the stream eventually dried up.

**the wilderness**  - This was a remote location with very few people. This may also be translated as, “desert” or, “the bush.”

So **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/elijah|Elijah]]** went to a **neighboring country**. A widow and her son in that country had almost run out of food because of **the famine**. But they **took care of**  Elijah, and **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]] provided for them so that their flour jar and their bottle of oil never became empty**. They had food through the whole famine. Elijah stayed there for several years.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**neighboring country**  - This refers to a country that was beside, or shared a border with Israel.
    * 


**the famine**  - If needed, this could be translated as, “the famine caused by the drought.”
    * 


**took care of**  – This means they gave him a place to stay in their house and provided food for him. It does not mean he was sick.

After three and a half years, **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]]** told **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/elijah|Elijah]]** to return to the **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/kingdom-of-israel|kingdom of Israel]]** and **speak with [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/ahab|Ahab]] because he was going to send**rain again.

Bring all the people of the kingdom of Israel to **Mount Carmel**.”

    * 


**speak with Ahab because he was going to send**  – This could be translated as, “tell Ahab that God was going to send.”
    * 


**you troublemaker**  - This means, “You are a troublemaker!” Ahab was accusing Elijah of causing trouble by telling the king that he was doing wrong and also by stopping the rain.
    * 


**You have abandoned Yahweh**  - That is, Ahab had led Israel to stop worshiping and obeying Yahweh.
    * 


**Mount Carmel**  - Mount Carmel is the name of a mountain located in northern Israel. It is over 500 meters high.

===== Elijah and the Prophets of Baal [19-06] =====


{{http://door43.org/_media/en/obs/obs-19-06.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=ed1ac2?nolink&640x360}}


All the people of the **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/kingdom-of-israel|kingdom of Israel]]**, including the 450 **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/prophet|prophets]]** of **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/baal|Baal]]**, came to **Mount Carmel**. **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/elijah|Elijah]]** said to the people, “**How long will you**  keep changing your mind? **If [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/yahweh|Yahweh]] is [[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/god|God]]**, serve him! **If Baal is God**, serve him!”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**Mount Carmel**  - See how you translated this in **[[http://door43.org/en/obs-training/sandbox/larrysallee/obs-training-text-and-notes#plugin_include__en__obs-training__frames__19-05|[19-05]]]**.
    * 


**How long will you**  - This is not a real question asking for information. Elijah was rebuking the Israelites for repeatedly changing their minds about whether they would serve Yahweh or Baal. Some languages will have to express this as a statement such as, “Stop changing your minds about whom you will worship!”
    * 


**If Yahweh is God…If Baal is God**  - This does not mean that Elijah was undecided. He knew that Yahweh is the real God. He wanted the people to understand that when they worship false gods, they are rejecting Yahweh as the only true God. Translate this in a way that shows that the people had to make a choice.

==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**who answers with fire**  - That is, “who supernaturally sends fire to burn up the sacrifice.”
    * 


**the real God**  - This means the one and only true God.

==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**prayed to Baal**  - the prophets of Baal asked Baal to send fire onto the bull they prepared as a sacrifice.
    * 


**shouted**  - They yelled or called out loudly to Baal.
    * 


**cut themselves with knives**  - They injured themselves with knives as an extreme way to show their devotion to Baal, hoping that this would persuade him to listen to them.
    * 


**there was no answer**  - There was no response of any kind to their shouting, and no fire came to burn up the sacrifice.

    * 


**seventy years later**  - This refers to the seventy years that had passed since the Babylonian army took the people of Jerusalem into exile.

    * 


**Persians**  - The Persian Empire grew to cover the area from central Asia to Egypt. Its home was located in the general area of modern-day Iran.
    * 


**The Israelites were now called Jews**  - This could also be translated as, “People now called the Israelites by the name 'Jews.'”

**the land of Judah**  - That is, the area where the kingdom of Judah was located before the Exile. Jerusalem was the capital city of Judah.

==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**From the very beginning**  - That is, from when the earth was first created.
    * 


**crush the snake’s head**  - Unless the head of a venomous snake is crushed, the snake can still hurt someone. Use a word for “crush” that communicates that its head is destroyed.
    * 


**The snake…was Satan**  – Satan spoke to Eve in the form of a snake. This does not mean that he is a snake now. This could be translated as, “The snake…was an appearance of Satan.”
    * 


**who deceived Eve**  - That is, “who lied to Eve.” The snake lied by making Eve doubt what God had said and tricking her into disobeying God.

The **[[http://door43.org/en/key-terms/messiah|Messiah]]** would **start the New Covenant**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * 


**Through the prophet Jeremiah God promised**  – This could be translated as, “Through the messages that God gave to Jeremiah, God promised” or, “The prophet Jeremiah told the people God's promise.”
    * 


**but not like**  - The New Covenant would be truly effective. People really would know God, they would truly live as his people, and He would forgive their sins completely, based on the Messiah's sacrifice of himself one time for all who believe in him.
    * 


**write his law on the people’s hearts**  - This is a metaphor meaning, “help his people to understand his laws and to earnestly desire to obey them.” If possible, keep the image of writing on their hearts, since this is in contrast with the way God had written his law on stone tablets for the Israelites. If that is not possible, you could just translate the meaning.
    * 


**be his people**  - This could be translated as, “be his special people” or, “be his favored people.”
    * 


**start the New Covenant**  - That is, “be the one to cause the New Covenant to take effect” or, “bring the New Covenant to his people.”

    * 


**on behalf of**  - This may be translated as, “for the benefit of” or, “in the place of.”
    * 


**as a substitute for the punishment for their sins**  - God allowed people to bring animals to sacrifice for their sin as a reminder of the punishment that they deserved and their dependence on God to remove their sin.
