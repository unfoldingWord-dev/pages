====== OBS Text and Notes – OT_EN ======


===== The Beginning [01-01] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-01-01.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


This is how **the beginning ** of everything happened. **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]] created**the **universe** and everything in it in six days. After God created the earth it was **dark ** and **empty**, and **nothing had been formed ** in it. But **[[:en:key-terms/holy-spirit|God's Spirit]]** was there over the water.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **the beginning**  - That is, “the beginning of all things,” before anything existed except God.
    * **created**  - This is used here in the sense of making something out of nothing.
    * **universe**  - This includes everything that God created on the earth and in the heavens, both visible and invisible things.
    * **dark**  - It was completely dark. There was no light at all, since God had not yet created light.
    * **empty**  - God had not yet created anything except for the bare earth covered by water.
    * **nothing had been formed**  - There were no distinguishing features–just water covering everything.
    * **God's Spirit**  - The Spirit of God, sometimes called the Holy Spirit, was present in the beginning, moving freely over the earth in order to create all that he had planned to do.

===== God Created Light [01-02] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-01-02.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Then **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]] said**, “**Let there be**  light!” And there was **light**. God saw that the light **was [[:en:key-terms/good|good]]** and called it “day.” He separated it from the darkness, which he called “night.” God created the light on the first day of **creation**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **God said**  - God created light by means of a simple verbal command.
    * **let there be**  - This is a command that happened immediately because it was spoken by God. It may be more natural to translate this as a statement of certainty that this would definitely happen. For example, you could translate this as, “God said, 'There will be light.'”
    * **light**  - This was a special light that God created–the sun was not created until later.
    * **was good**  - This phrase is often repeated through the Creation story, and emphasizes that each stage of creation was pleasing to God and accomplished his plan and purpose.
    * **creation**  - This word is used here to refer to the six-day period during which God made everything that exists.

On **the second day**  of creation, **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]] spoke**and **created**  the **sky**  above the earth. He made the sky by separating the water above from the water below.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **the second day**  - God's work of creation was orderly, purposeful, and sequential. The things he created each day built upon and depended on the acts of the previous days.
    * **God spoke**  - God created the sky by speaking a command.
    * **created**  - God made the sky out of nothing.
    * **sky**  - This term refers to all of the space above the earth, including the air we breathe and the heavens.

===== God Created the Land [01-04] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-01-04.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


On the **third day**, **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]] spoke**and separated the water from the dry land. He called the dry land “**earth**,” and he called the water “seas.” God saw that what he had **created**  was **[[:en:key-terms/good|good]]**.

    * **God spoke**  - God created the dry land by speaking a command.
    * **earth**  - This word is used here to refer to dirt or soil, which is what dry land is made of. The word “earth” in **[[:en:obs:notes:frames:01-01|[01-01]]]** refers to the whole world that people live on.
    * **created**  - This word is used here in the sense of making something out of nothing.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:01-03|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:01|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:01-05|>>]]**


===== God Created the Plants [01-05] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-01-05.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Then **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]] said**, “**Let the earth produce**  **all kinds**  of trees and plants.” And that is what happened. God saw that what he had **created**  **was [[:en:key-terms/good|good]]**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **God said**  - God created all vegetation by speaking a command.
    * **let the earth produce**  - This is a command that happened immediately because God spoke it.

On **the fifth day**, **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]] spoke**and made **everything that swims**  in the water and **all the birds**. God saw that **it was [[:en:key-terms/good|good]]**, and he **[[:en:key-terms/bless|blessed]] them**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **the fifth day**  - God continues his orderly progression of creation that he started during the previous four days.
    * **God spoke**  - God created the birds and water creatures by speaking a command.

    * **it was good**  - This phrase is repeated throughout creation to show that every step went exactly according to God's wise plan and purpose.
    * **blessed them**  - God speaks his desire that they would prosper and that things would go well for them in the world in which he had placed them.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:01-06|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:01|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:01-08|>>]]**


===== God Created the Animals [01-08] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-01-08.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


On **the sixth day**  of creation, **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]] said**, “Let there be **all kinds**  of **land animals**!” And it happened just like God said. Some were **farm animals**, some **crawled on the ground**, and some were **wild**. And God saw that **it was [[:en:key-terms/good|good]]**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **the sixth day**  - The next event in a continuing, orderly progression of days and creative acts.
    * **God said**  - God's spoken word is the means by which the animals were created.
    * **all kinds**  - This indicates a great variety, but also order.
    * **land animals**  - Every kind of animal that lived on the land, as opposed to the birds, or animals that live in the seas.
    * **farm animals**  - The kinds of land animals that commonly live peacefully with people–-as in tame, or domesticated animals.
    * **crawled on the ground**  - This probably includes reptiles, and possibly the insects.
    * **wild**  - The kinds of animals that do not normally live peacefully with people, usually because they are afraid of people, or dangerous to them.
    * **it was good**  - This phrase is repeated throughout creation to show that every step went exactly according to God's wise plan and purpose.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:01-07|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:01|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:01-09|>>]]**


===== God Made Man in His Image [01-09] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-01-09.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Then **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** said, “**Let us**  make human beings **in our image**  to be **like us**. They will have **authority**  over the earth and all the animals.”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **Let us**  - This indicates God's deliberate, willful decision to create man in a particular way for a particular purpose. You could translate this as, “We will make.”
    * **us…our…us**  - The Bible teaches that there is one God, but the Old Testament word “God” is a plural form, and God uses plural pronouns when speaking to himself. Some understand this as a special way of speaking that expresses God's majesty, and others understand this as God the Father speaking to the Son and the Spirit, who are all God.
    * **in our image**  - An image is a physical representation of someone or something. Humans were made in such a way that we display or represent some of the qualities or traits of God.
    * **like us**  - Humans share some of God's characteristics, but not all of his qualities. This phrase should be translated with words that show man is similar to God, but not equal with him or the same as he is.
    * **authority**  - God gave people the right and power to manage, guide, and control how the earth and the animals will be used.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:01-08|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:01|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:01-10|>>]]**


===== God Made Adam [01-10] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-01-10.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


So **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]****took some dirt**, **formed it**  into **a man**, and **breathed [[:en:key-terms/life|life]]** into him. This man's name was **[[:en:key-terms/adam|Adam]]**. God planted a **garden**  where Adam could live, and put him there to **care for it**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **took some dirt**  - God made man from the dust, or dry dirt from the ground. This word should probably be different from the general word used for earth.
    * **formed it**  - This word expresses that God personally fashioned the man, comparing this to how a person creates something with his hands. Make sure that a different word from “create” is used. Note that this is very different from how he created everything else through a simple spoken command.
    * **a man**  - Only the man was created at this time; the woman was created later by a different method.
    * **breathed life**  - This phrase expresses God's very personal, intimate action as he transferred life from himself into Adam's body, comparing this to how a human being breathes out air.
    * **life**  - In this event, God breathed both physical and spiritual life into the man.
    * **Adam**  - Adam's name is the same as the Old Testament word for “man,” and similar to the word for “dirt” from which he was formed.
    * **garden**  - An area of land planted with trees and plants for a purpose–usually to produce food or to provide beauty.
    * **care for it**  - To maintain the garden by tending, weeding, watering, harvesting, planting, etc.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:01-09|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:01|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:01-11|>>]]**


===== Two Trees [01-11] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-01-11.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**In the middle**  of the **garden**, **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** planted two special trees—the **tree of [[:en:key-terms/life|life]]** and the **tree of the knowledge**  of **[[:en:key-terms/good|good]]** and **[[:en:key-terms/evil|evil]]**. God told **[[:en:key-terms/adam|Adam]]** that he could eat from any tree in the garden except from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. If he ate from this tree, he would **[[:en:key-terms/death|die]]**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **in the middle**  - The central location emphasizes the importance of the two trees.
    * **garden**  - An area of land planted with trees and plants for a purpose–usually to produce food or to provide beauty.
    * **tree of life**  - Anyone who ate fruit from this tree would never die.
    * **tree of knowledge of good and evil**  - The fruit of this tree could enable a person to know both good and evil.
    * **knowledge**  - To know or understand by personal experience.
    * **good and evil**  - Evil is the opposite of good. Just as “good” refers to what is pleasing to God, “evil” refers to everything that is not pleasing to God.
    * **die**  - In this instance, he would die both physically and spiritually.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:01-10|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:01|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:01-12|>>]]**


===== Adam Was Alone [01-12] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-01-12.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Then **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** said, “It is **not [[:en:key-terms/good|good]]** for man to be **alone**.” But none of the animals could be **[[:en:key-terms/adam|Adam's]] helper**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **not good**  - This is the first time that anything in creation was not good. It means it was, “not yet good” because God was not finished with the creation of humans.
    * **alone**  - Adam was the only human, with no possibility of a relationship with another person, and unable to reproduce children and multiply.
    * **Adam's helper**  - There was no one who was similar enough to Adam to join with him to accomplish the task that God gave to him. None of the animals could do this.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:01-11|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:01|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:01-13|>>]]**


===== God Made Eve [01-13] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-01-13.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


So **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** made **[[:en:key-terms/adam|Adam]]** fall into **a deep sleep**. Then God **took one of Adam's ribs and made**  it into **a woman**  and **brought her to him**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **a deep sleep**  - This was a deeper sleep than normal.
    * **took one of Adam's ribs and made**  - The verbs indicate God's very personal act of removing the rib from Adam and shaping it into a woman.
    * **a woman**  - She was the first woman, the female version of human beings that was missing until now.
    * **brought her to him**  - God personally introduced them. He presented the woman to Adam, almost like offering a special gift.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:01-12|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:01|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:01-14|>>]]**


===== Adam Met Eve [01-14] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-01-14.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


When **[[:en:key-terms/adam|Adam]]** saw her, he said, “**At last**! This one is **like me**! Let her be called '**Woman**,' for she was **made from Man**.” This is why **a man leaves**  his father and mother and **becomes one**  with his wife.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **At last!**  - Adam's exclamation indicates that he had been waiting for something like the woman.
    * **like me**  - The woman was the same type of being as Adam, even though there were important differences between them.
    * **Woman**  - This word is the feminine form of the word for man.
    * **made from man**  - The woman was formed directly from Adam's own body.
    * **a man leaves**  - This is stated in the present tense to indicate what would become the normal situation in the future. Adam did not have a mother or father, but all other men would.
    * **becomes one**  - The husband and wife will share an intimate bond of unity and a commitment to one another that will surpass their relationships to anyone else.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:01-13|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:01|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:01-15|>>]]**


===== Fill the Earth [01-15] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-01-15.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**[[:en:key-terms/god|God]] made**man and woman **in his own image**. He **[[:en:key-terms/bless|blessed]]** them and told them, “Have many children and grandchildren and fill the earth!” And God saw that everything he had made was **very [[:en:key-terms/good|good]]**, and he was very pleased with all of it. This all happened on the sixth day of **creation**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **God made**  - God formed the man and the woman in a very personal way.
    * **in his own image**  - An image is a physical representation of someone or something. God made people to display or represent some of his qualities and traits, but not to be equal to him.
    * **very good**  - More intense than the, “it was good” statements on previous days. “Very good” refers to all of creation, not just the man and the woman. Everything was exactly as God intended it to be.
    * **creation**  - The six-day period during which God made everything that exists.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:01-14|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:01|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:01-16|>>]]**


===== God Rested [01-16] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-01-16.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


When **the seventh day**  came, **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** had **finished his work**. So **God rested**  from all he had been doing. He **[[:en:key-terms/bless|blessed]] the seventh day**and **made it [[:en:key-terms/holy|holy]]**, because on this day he rested from his work. This is how God created **the universe**  and everything in it.


//A Bible story from: Genesis 1-2//


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **the seventh day**  - The next day after the six days of creation were completed.
    * **finished his work**  - Specifically, God finished the work of creation. He still performs other work.
    * **God rested**  - God “rested” in the sense that he stopped working because creation was complete. God was not tired, or unable to continue.
    * **blessed the seventh day**  - God had a special, positive plan for the seventh day, and for every seventh day to follow.
    * **made it holy**  - That is, God “set apart” the day as a special day. It was not to be used in the same way as the other six days of the week.
    * **the universe**  - This includes everything that God created on the earth and in the heavens, both visible and invisible things.
    * //A Bible story from//  - These references may be slightly different in some Bible translations.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:01-15|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:01|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:02-01|>>]]**


===== A Perfect World [02-01] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-02-01.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**[[:en:key-terms/adam|Adam]]** and his wife were very happy living in the beautiful garden **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** had made for them. Neither of them wore clothes, but this did not cause them to feel any **shame**, because there was no **[[:en:key-terms/sin|sin]]** in the world. They often walked in the garden and **talked with God**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **garden**  - A special collection of trees and plants that God prepared for Adam and Eve to enjoy and from which to eat. This should be the same word that was used in **[[:en:obs:notes:frames:01-11|[01-11]]]**. See how you translated it there.
    * **talked with God**  - The word for “talk” should be the same as would be used to refer to talking to a human being. God may have taken a physical form to talk to the man and the woman since the text indicates that they talked to him face-to-face.
    * **shame**  - The feeling that comes with knowing we have sinned or that we fall short in some way. Before sin came into the world, there was no sense of shame about being naked.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:01-16|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:02|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:02-02|>>]]**


===== The Snake [02-02] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-02-02.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


But there was a **crafty snake**  in the garden. He asked the woman, “**Did [[:en:key-terms/god|God]] really tell you**not to eat the **fruit from any of the trees**  in the garden?”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **crafty**  - Clever and sly, with the intent to deceive.
    * **snake**  - An elongated, legless land creature that now moves by wiggling on its belly. Although later on in the story it is revealed that the snake is Satan, this should not be said here in this frame.
    * **Did God really tell you**  - The snake asked the woman whether God actually said not to eat from any of the trees in the garden. But he was only pretending that he didn't know what God had said because he wanted to create doubt in the woman's mind. He wanted her to question God's goodness.
    * **fruit of any of the trees**  - All of the various types of fruit from each of the different trees in the garden.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:02-01|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:02|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:02-03|>>]]**


===== Do Not Touch [02-03] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-02-03.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


The woman answered, “**[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** told us we could eat the **fruit**  of any tree except from the **tree of the knowledge of [[:en:key-terms/good|good]] and [[:en:key-terms/evil|evil]]**. God told us, ‘If you eat that fruit or even touch it, **you will [[:en:key-terms/death|die]]**.’”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **fruit**  - We don't know what kind of fruit this was. We only know that it grew on this tree. If possible it is best to use a general word for fruit here, and not a word for a specific kind of fruit.
    * **tree of the knowledge of good and evil**  - The woman correctly understood that they were not allowed to eat from this one tree that would enable them to understand evil as well as good.
    * **you will die**  - Use your ordinary word for death, for a person's physical life to end. Don't avoid the term just because the thought of death sounds too harsh.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:02-02|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:02|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:02-04|>>]]**


===== The Lie [02-04] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-02-04.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


The snake responded to the woman, “That is not **[[:en:key-terms/true|true]]**! You will not **[[:en:key-terms/death|die]]**. **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** just knows that as soon as you eat it, you will be **like God**  and will **understand [[:en:key-terms/good|good]] and [[:en:key-terms/evil|evil]]** like he does.”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **like God**  - The man and the woman were already made in the likeness of God. The snake is suggesting that the woman would be more like God if she understood evil. However, God never intended for her to have this knowledge.
    * **understand good and evil**  - To know from personal experience what things are good and what things are bad, or being able to know whether something is good or bad.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:02-03|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:02|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:02-05|>>]]**


===== Disobedience [02-05] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-02-05.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


The woman saw that the fruit was beautiful and looked delicious. She also wanted to be **[[:en:key-terms/wise|wise]]**, so she picked some of the fruit and ate it. Then she gave some to her husband, **who was with her**, and he ate it, too.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **wise**  - The woman wanted to have insight and understanding like the snake seemed to have, and like God has.
    * **who was with her**  - This is important information because it shows that the man was present when the woman made the decision to eat the fruit.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:02-04|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:02|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:02-06|>>]]**


===== Open Eyes [02-06] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-02-06.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Suddenly, **their eyes were opened**, and they realized **they were naked**. They tried to **cover their bodies**  by sewing leaves together to make clothes.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **their eyes were opened**  - This could be translated as, “they saw things differently.” This expression means they now understood something for the first time. In your language, there may be an expression with similar meaning that you could use to translate this.
    * **realized they were naked**  - After the man and the woman disobeyed God, they felt ashamed that they were naked. That is why they used leaves to try to cover their naked bodies.
    * **cover their bodies**  - The man and the woman attempted to use leaves to hide themselves from God.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:02-05|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:02|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:02-07|>>]]**


===== Where Are You? [02-07] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-02-07.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Then the man and his wife heard the sound of **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]] walking**through the garden. They both hid from God. Then God called to the man, “**Where are you?**” **[[:en:key-terms/adam|Adam]]** replied, “I heard you walking in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked. So I hid.”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **God walking**  - It seems that God regularly came to the garden to walk and talk with the man and the woman. We do not know what this looked like. If it is possible, it is best to use the same word that would be used to talk about a person walking.
    * **Where are you?**  - God already knew the answer to this question. The purpose of the question was to force the man and the woman to explain why they were hiding.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:02-06|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:02|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:02-08|>>]]**


===== The Blame [02-08] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-02-08.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Then **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** asked, “**Who told you that you were naked?**  Did you eat the fruit I told you not to eat?” The man answered, “You gave me this woman, and **she gave me the fruit**.” Then God asked the woman, “What have you done?” The woman replied, “**The snake tricked me**.”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **Who told you that you were naked?**  - Or, “How did you find out that you were naked?” God already knows the answer to all of his questions. By asking this question and the following question, he was giving Adam the opportunity to admit his sin of disobedience. Being naked was not a sin. God created them that way. Their knowledge of their nakedness was the problem. Their shame showed that they had sinned.
    * **she gave me the fruit**  - The man blamed the woman rather than confessing his disobedience and accepting responsibility for disobeying God.
    * **What have you done?**  - Or, “Why have you done this?” God already knew the answer to this question. By asking this question, he was giving the woman the opportunity to admit her guilt. He was also implying that she should not have done what she did.
    * **The snake tricked me**  - The snake deceived or misled her. He lied to her. Don't use a word that indicates that he cast a spell on her or bewitched her. The woman blamed the snake rather than confessing her disobedience and accepting responsibility for disobeying God.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:02-07|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:02|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:02-09|>>]]**


===== God Cursed the Snake [02-09] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-02-09.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** said to the snake, “**You are [[:en:key-terms/curse|cursed]]**! You will slide on your belly and eat dirt. You and the woman will **hate each other**, and your children and her children will hate each other, too. The **woman’s [[:en:key-terms/descendant|descendant]]** will **crush your head**, and you will **wound his heel**.”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **you are cursed**  - This could also be translated as, “I curse you” or, “Great harm will come to you.” Do not use a word that implies magic.
    * **hate each other**  - The woman would hate the snake and the snake would hate the woman. The women's descendants would also hate the snake's descendants, and the snake's descendants would hate them.
    * **woman's descendant**  - Refers to one of her descendants in particular.
    * **crush your head**  - The descendant of the woman will destroy the descendant of the snake.
    * **wound his heel**  - The descendant of the snake will wound the descendant of the woman.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:02-08|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:02|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:02-10|>>]]**


===== God Cursed the Woman [02-10] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-02-10.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** then said to the woman, “I will make **childbirth very painful**  for you. You will desire your husband, and he will rule over you.”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **childbirth very painful**  - Some languages may need to express this as a verb. You could say, “I will cause you to have much more pain when you give birth to children.”

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:02-09|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:02|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:02-11|>>]]**


===== God Cursed the Man [02-11] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-02-11.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** said to the man, “You listened to your wife and **[[:en:key-terms/disobey|disobeyed]]** me. Now the **ground is [[:en:key-terms/curse|cursed]]**, and you will need to work hard to grow food. Then **you will [[:en:key-terms/death|die]]**, and your body will **return to dirt**.” The man named his wife **[[:en:key-terms/eve|Eve]], which means “life-giver**,” because she would become the **mother of all people**. And God clothed **[[:en:key-terms/adam|Adam]]** and Eve with animal skins.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **ground is cursed**  - As punishment for Adam's disobedience, the earth would no longer be fruitful. Adam would have to work very hard to raise enough food to eat.
    * **you will die**  - The ultimate punishment for their disobedience was death. Spiritual death is our separation from God. Physical death is our separation from our body.
    * **return to dirt**  - God created Adam from the dirt or soil and gave him life. As a result of sin, his life will be taken from him and his body will decompose and become dirt again.
    * **Eve, which means 'life-giver'**  - God gave life to Adam and Eve, and it is passed on to every person through childbirth.
    * **mother of all people**  - This means that she would be the female ancestor of all people. Some languages say “she would be the grandmother of all people.”

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:02-10|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:02|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:02-12|>>]]**


===== Out of the Garden [02-12] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-02-12.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Then **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** said, “Now that the human beings have become **like us by knowing [[:en:key-terms/good|good]] and [[:en:key-terms/evil|evil]]**, they must not be allowed to eat the **fruit**  of the **tree of [[:en:key-terms/life|life]]** and live forever.” So God sent **[[:en:key-terms/adam|Adam]]** and **[[:en:key-terms/eve|Eve]]** away from the beautiful garden. God placed large, powerful **[[:en:key-terms/angel|angels]]** at the entrance to the garden to keep anyone from eating the fruit of the tree of life.


//A Bible story from: Genesis 3//


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **like us by knowing good and evil**  - Here, this phrase points to a new way that Adam and Eve would be like God. Because they had sinned, they were aware of evil and could experience it. You could say, “because now they knew both good and evil.”
    * **fruit**  - The specific kind of fruit is not revealed, so it is best to translate this using a general word for fruit.
    * **tree of life**  - This was an actual tree with fruit. See **[[:en:obs:notes:frames:01-11|[01-11]]]**. If a person ate this fruit he would live continually and never die.
    * //A Bible story from//  - These references may be slightly different in some Bible translations.

===== Sin Increased [03-01] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-03-01.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**After a long time**, many people were living in the world. They had become **very wicked and violent**. **It became so bad**  that **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]] decided to destroy**the whole world with a **huge flood**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **After a long time**  - This story happens many generations (hundreds of years) after creation.
    * **very wicked and violent**  - It may be more natural to say, “had become wicked and did violent things”.
    * **It became so bad**  – It may be clearer to say, “People were behaving in such harmful and evil ways that God.”
    * **God decided to destroy**  - This does not mean that the earth would be destroyed completely. Rather God planned to destroy all the people who had rebelled against him and who had caused such evil and violence. This flood would also kill all the land animals and the birds.
    * **huge flood**  - Very deep water that would cover the earth, even in places where the ground was normally dry, and even covering the tops of the highest mountains.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:02-12|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:03|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:03-02|>>]]**


===== Noah Found Grace [03-02] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-03-02.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


But **[[:en:key-terms/noah|Noah]] found favor**with **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]**. He was a **[[:en:key-terms/righteous|righteous]]** man, living among wicked people. God told Noah about the flood He was **planning to send**. He told Noah to build a huge boat.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **found favor**  - God was pleased with Noah because he feared and obeyed God. So even though Noah was not sinless, God was gracious to him and made a plan to rescue his family from the devastating flood. Make sure this doesn't sound like Noah was lucky or that he just happened to escape. Rather, it was God's choice.
    * **the flood**  - See how you translated this in **[[:en:obs:notes:frames:03-01|[03-01]]]**.
    * **planning to send**  - God planned to cause deep water to cover the earth by sending a lot of rain. That is, he planned to cause the flood by causing a lot of rain to fall.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:03-01|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:03|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:03-03|>>]]**


===== The Big Boat [03-03] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-03-03.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** told **[[:en:key-terms/noah|Noah]]** to make **the boat**  about 140 meters long, 23 meters wide, and 13.5 meters high. Noah was to build it with wood and to make three levels, many rooms, a roof, and a window. The boat would keep Noah, his family, and every kind of land animal safe during the flood.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **the boat**  - The boat was big enough to carry eight people, two of every kind of animal, and their provisions for almost a year.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:03-02|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:03|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:03-04|>>]]**


===== Building the Boat [03-04] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-03-04.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**[[:en:key-terms/noah|Noah]]** **[[:en:key-terms/obey|obeyed]]** **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]**. He and his three sons built the boat just the way God had told them. It took many years to build the boat, because it was so big. **Noah warned**  the people about the flood that was coming and told them to **turn to God**, but they did not believe him.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **Noah warned**  - Noah told everyone that God planned to destroy the world because of sin.
    * **turn to God**  - This means that they should stop sinning and start obeying God.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:03-03|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:03|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:03-05|>>]]**


===== Loading the Boat [03-05] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-03-05.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** also commanded **[[:en:key-terms/noah|Noah]]** and his family to gather enough food for themselves and the animals. When everything was ready, God told Noah it was time for him, his wife, his three sons, and their wives to get into the boat—eight people in all.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:03-04|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:03|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:03-06|>>]]**


===== The Animals Came [03-06] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-03-06.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**[[:en:key-terms/god|God]] sent**a male and a female of every animal and bird to **[[:en:key-terms/noah|Noah]]** so they could go into the boat and be kept safe during the flood. God sent seven males and seven females of every type of animal that could be **used for [[:en:key-terms/sacrifice|sacrifices]]**. When they were all in the boat, **God himself closed the door**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **God sent**  - Noah did not need to find the animals. God sent them to him.
    * **used for sacrifices**  - For some languages it may be better to say something like, “animals that were acceptable to sacrifice to God.” God had decided that people should sacrifice animals to him, but he only permitted them to sacrifice certain kinds of animals.
    * **God himself closed the door**  - This emphasizes that it was God who shut the door.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:03-05|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:03|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:03-07|>>]]**


===== The Rain Began [03-07] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-03-07.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Then it began to **rain, and rain, and rain**. It rained for forty days and forty nights without stopping! Water also came **gushing**  up out of the earth. Everything in the **whole world was covered**  with water, even the highest mountains.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **rain, and rain, and rain**  - This emphasizes that there was an unusual, extreme amount of rain. Other languages may have a different way of emphasizing this.
    * **gushing**  - This indicates that there was a large amount of water coming out.
    * **whole world was covered**  - This refers to all the earth being covered with water from the flood.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:03-06|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:03|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:03-08|>>]]**


===== Safe from the Flood [03-08] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-03-08.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Everything that lived on the dry land **[[:en:key-terms/death|died]]**, except the people and animals that were in the boat. The boat floated on the water and kept everything inside the boat safe from drowning.

    * //(There are no notes for this frame.)//

===== The Rain Stopped [03-09] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-03-09.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


After **the rains stopped**, the boat floated on the water for five months, and during this time the water started going down. Then one day the **boat rested**  on the top of a mountain, but the world was still covered with water. After **three more months**, the tops of the **mountains were visible**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **the rains stopped**  – This could be translated as, “it stopped raining.”
    * **boat rested**  - There was so much water from the rain that it covered the mountains. The ship floated over the mountains, and when the water started to go down, the ship went down with the water and settled on a mountain.
    * **three more months**  - During the next three months, the water continued to go down.
    * **mountains were visible**  - Other ways to translate this would be, “were showing” or, “appeared” or, “could be seen.” It may be more clear to say, “After three months, the water had gone down enough so that Noah and his family could clearly see the tops of the mountains.

===== The Raven [03-10] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-03-10.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


After forty more days, **[[:en:key-terms/noah|Noah]]** sent out a bird called a **raven**  to see if the water had dried up. The raven flew back and forth looking for dry land, but it could not find any.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **raven**  - A black bird that flies and eats a variety of plant and animal foods, including the rotting flesh of dead animals.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:03-09|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:03|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:03-11|>>]]**


===== The Dove [03-11] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-03-11.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Later **[[:en:key-terms/noah|Noah]]** sent out a bird called a **dove**. But it also could not find any dry land, so it came back to Noah. A week later he sent the dove out again, and it came back with an **olive branch**  in its beak! **The water was going down**, and the plants were growing again!


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **dove**  - A small, white or gray flying bird that eats seeds or fruit.
    * **olive branch**  - An olive tree's fruit contains oil which people use for cooking or putting on their skin. If your language does not have a word for “olive branch,” you could translate it as, “branch from a tree called 'olive'” or, “branch from an oil-tree.”
    * **water was going down**  - It may be more natural in your language to say that, “the water was going away” or, “the level of the water was getting lower.”

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:03-10|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:03|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:03-12|>>]]**


===== Dry Land [03-12] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-03-12.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**[[:en:key-terms/noah|Noah]]****waited another week**  and sent out the dove a third time. This time, it found a place to rest and did not come back. The water was drying up!


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **waited another week**  - You could say, “waited seven more days.” The word “waited” shows that Noah was allowing time for the floodwaters to go down before sending out the dove again.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:03-11|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:03|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:03-13|>>]]**


===== Leaving the Boat [03-13] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-03-13.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**Two months later [[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** said to **[[:en:key-terms/noah|Noah]]**, “You and your family and all the animals may leave the boat now. **Have many children**  and grandchildren and **fill the earth**.” So Noah and his family came out of the boat.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **Two months later**  - This means two months after Noah released the dove from the ark. It may be necessary to say this explicitly if it is not clear.
    * **Have many children**  – To make sure it is clear that this was God's command and desire, you could say, “You must have many children.” or, “I want you to have many children.”
    * **fill the earth**  - If this is not clear, it may be necessary to say, “and fill the earth with people” or, “so that there will be many people living on the earth.”

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:03-12|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:03|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:03-14|>>]]**


===== Noah's Sacrifice [03-14] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-03-14.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


After **[[:en:key-terms/noah|Noah]]** got off the boat, he built an **[[:en:key-terms/altar|altar]]** and **[[:en:key-terms/sacrifice|sacrificed]]** some of each kind of **animal that could be used for a sacrifice**. **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]] was happy**with the sacrifice and **[[:en:key-terms/bless|blessed]]** Noah and his family.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **animal that could be used for a sacrifice**  - Another way to say this would be, “that people could use to sacrifice to him.”
    * **God was happy**  - God was pleased with Noah for sacrificing these animals.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:03-13|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:03|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:03-15|>>]]**


===== God's Promise [03-15] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-03-15.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** said, “I **[[:en:key-terms/promise|promise]]** I will **never again**  **[[:en:key-terms/curse|curse]]** the ground because of the **[[:en:key-terms/evil|evil]]** things that people do, or destroy the world by causing a flood, even though **people are [[:en:key-terms/sin|sinful]] from the time they are children**.”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **never again**  - This means, “not ever again” or, “not again at any time” or, “truly not again”. Examples: “I will not ever again curse the ground” or, “I will not curse the ground again at any time” or, “I will truly not curse the ground again”.
    * **curse the ground**  - The earth and the other creatures suffered because of man's sin.
    * **the world**  – This refers to the earth and the living creatures that lived on it.
    * **people are sinful from the time they are children**  - Another way to say this would be, “people do sinful things their entire lives.”

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:03-14|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:03|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:03-16|>>]]**


===== The Rainbow [03-16] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-03-16.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** then made the first **rainbow**  as **a sign of his [[:en:key-terms/promise|promise]]**. **Every time**  the rainbow appeared in the sky, God would remember **what he promised**  and so would his people.


//A Bible story from: Genesis 6-8//


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **rainbow**  - This is the multicolored arc of light that often appears in the sky after a rainstorm.
    * **a sign**  - A sign is something (such as an object or event) that gives a certain meaning or which points to something that is true or will happen.
    * **as a sign of his promise**  – In some languages it may be better to say, “to show that he had promised.”
    * **Every time**  – Make sure it is clear that this means every time a rainbow appeared from that time on. It may be necessary to add, “From then on, every time.”
    * **what he promised**  - This refers back to the previous frame in which God promised to never again destroy the earth with a flood.
    * //A Bible story from//  - These references may be slightly different in some Bible translations.

===== One People [04-01] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-04-01.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**Many years after the flood**, there were **again many people**  in the world, and they all spoke the **same language**. Instead of filling the earth as **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** had commanded, they gathered together and built **a city**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **many years after the flood**  - Many generations had passed since the end of the flood.
    * **again many people**  - Noah's family multiplied into enough people to fill a city.
    * **same language**  - This means there was only one language, so they could all understand each other.
    * **a city**  - It is best to use a general word for “city” since the text does not give a specific name.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:03-16|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:04|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:04-02|>>]]**


===== The Tower [04-02] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-04-02.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


They were very **[[:en:key-terms/proud|proud]]**, and they did not care about what **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** said. They even began building a **tall tower to reach [[:en:key-terms/heaven|heaven]]**. God saw that if they all kept working together to do **[[:en:key-terms/evil|evil]]**, they could do many more **[[:en:key-terms/sin|sinful]]** things.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **tall tower to reach heaven**  - This structure was so tall that its top would be in the sky.
    * **heaven**  – This could be translated as, “sky.”

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:04-01|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:04|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:04-03|>>]]**


===== Many Languages [04-03] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-04-03.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


So **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]] changed their language**into **many different languages**  and **spread the people**  out all over the world. The city they had begun to build was called **Babel**, which means, “**confused**.”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **changed their language**  – In an instant, God miraculously gave them different languages to speak so that suddenly they were no longer able to understand each other.
    * **many different languages**  – Instead of one large group of people speaking one language, there were now many smaller people groups each speaking its own separate language.
    * **spread the people**  - When God changed their languages, he caused these groups of people to scatter out on the earth and each group moved to its own area.
    * **Babel**  - We don't know the exact location of this city, other than it was somewhere in the ancient Middle East.
    * **confused**  - This refers to how the people were confused or, “mixed-up” when they could no longer understand each other after God changed their language.

===== God Chose Abram [04-04] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-04-04.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**Hundreds of years later, [[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** spoke to a man named **[[:en:key-terms/abraham|Abram]]**. God told him, “**Leave your country**  **and family**  and go to the land I will show you. I will **[[:en:key-terms/bless|bless]]** you and **make you a great nation**. I will **make your name great**. I will bless those who bless you and **[[:en:key-terms/curse|curse]]** those who curse you. **All families on earth**  will be blessed because of you.”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **Hundreds of years later**  – This could be translated as, ”many generations after the people split into different language groups at Babel.” or, ”a long time after that happened.”
    * **Leave your country**  - This refers to the area where Abram was born and grew up (a region in Central Asia called “Ur”). It could be translated as, “native region” or, “homeland” or something similar.
    * **and family**  – God was calling Abram to leave behind most of his relatives. However, God was not telling Abram to abandon the people he was responsible for, including his wife.
    * **make you a great nation**  - God would cause Abram to have many descendants, and they would become a large and important nation or country.
    * **make your name great**  - This means that Abram's name and family would become well-known throughout the world and people would think well of them.
    * **all families on earth**  - Abram's decision to follow God would affect not only his own family, but also families from every people group on earth.

===== To Canaan [04-05] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-04-05.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


So **[[:en:key-terms/abraham|Abram]]** **[[:en:key-terms/obey|obeyed]]** **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]**. **He took**  his wife, **[[:en:key-terms/sarah|Sarai]]**, together with all of his **[[:en:key-terms/servant|servants]]** and everything he owned and went to the land **God showed him**, the **land of [[:en:key-terms/canaan|Canaan]]**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **He took**  – Some languages would say, “He brought” here. Others would use two different verbs here, such as, “He caused his wife to come with him” and, “He brought along all of their servants and possessions.”
    * **God showed him**  - Somehow God made it clear to Abram where he was to go. The text doesn't tell how God showed him.
    * **land of Canaan**  - The name of this land was “Canaan”. This could be translated, “the land called Canaan.”

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:04-04|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:04|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:04-06|>>]]**


===== God Blessed Abram [04-06] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-04-06.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


When **[[:en:key-terms/abraham|Abram]]** arrived in **[[:en:key-terms/canaan|Canaan]]**, **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** said, “Look all around you. I will give to you and your **[[:en:key-terms/descendant|descendants]] all the land that you can see as an [[:en:key-terms/inherit|inheritance]]**”. **Then Abram settled in the land**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **all the land that you can see**  - If Abram was standing on a mountain, he could have seen a very large area. On several occasions God promised to give the entire land of Canaan to Abram and his descendants.
    * **as an inheritance**  - God promised to give land to Abram and his descendants as a father gives land and possessions to his children.
    * **Then Abram settled in the land**  - Abram lived there along with all those who had gone there with him.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:04-05|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:04|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:04-07|>>]]**


===== Melchizedek [04-07] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-04-07.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


One day, **[[:en:key-terms/abraham|Abram]]** met **Melchizedek**, the **[[:en:key-terms/priest|priest]]** of **[[:en:key-terms/god|God Most High]]**. Melchizedek **[[:en:key-terms/bless|blessed]]** Abram and said, “May God Most High who **owns [[:en:key-terms/heaven|heaven]] and earth**bless Abram.” Then Abram gave Melchizedek a tenth of all he owned.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **Melchizedek**  - Melchizedek was the recognized religious authority in Canaan who received and presented offerings to God.
    * **God Most High**  - The people of Canaan worshiped many false gods. The title, “Most High God” explains that the God that Melchizedek worshiped was far superior to all of them, and was the same God that Abram worshiped.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:04-06|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:04|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:04-08|>>]]**


===== No Son [04-08] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-04-08.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**Many years**  went by, but **[[:en:key-terms/abraham|Abram]]** and **[[:en:key-terms/sarah|Sarai]]** still did not have a **[[:en:key-terms/son|son]]**. **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** spoke to Abram and **[[:en:key-terms/promise|promised]]** again that he would have a son and as many **[[:en:key-terms/descendant|descendants]] as the stars in the sky**. Abram **[[:en:key-terms/believe|believed]]** God's promise. God declared that Abram was **[[:en:key-terms/righteous|righteous]]** because he believed in God's promise.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **Many years**  - Several years had passed since God had first promised that Abram would have a son.
    * **as the stars in the sky**  - This expression means that Abram's descendants will be so many that no one can count them all.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:04-07|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:04|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:04-09|>>]]**


===== God's Covenant [04-09] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-04-09.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Then **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** made a **[[:en:key-terms/covenant|covenant]]** with **[[:en:key-terms/abraham|Abram]]**. A covenant is an agreement between **two parties**. God said, “I will give you a **[[:en:key-terms/son|son]] from your own body**. I give the land of **[[:en:key-terms/canaan|Canaan]]** to your **[[:en:key-terms/descendant|descendants]]**.” But Abram still **did not have a son**.


//A Bible story from: Genesis 11-15//


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **two parties**  - The parties could be two people, two groups of people, or a person and a group of people. In this case the agreement was between God and Abram.
    * **from your own body**  - With his own body Abram would cause his wife to become pregnant, so that together they would have their own, natural son. This was an amazing promise, since Abram and Sarai were very old.
    * **did not have a son**  - Abram still did not have any descendants who could possess the land.
    * //A Bible story from//  - These references may be slightly different in some Bible translations.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:04-08|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:04|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:05-01|>>]]**


===== Hagar [05-01] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-05-01.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Ten years after **[[:en:key-terms/abraham|Abram]]** and **[[:en:key-terms/sarah|Sarai]]** arrived in **[[:en:key-terms/canaan|Canaan]]**, **they still did not have a child**. So Abram's wife, Sarai, said to him, “Since **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** has not allowed me to have children and now I am too old to have children, here is my **[[:en:key-terms/servant|servant]], [[:en:key-terms/hagar|Hagar]]**. **Marry her also**  so she can **have a child for me**.”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **still did not have a child**  - Without a child, Abram had no descendants to become a great nation.
    * **Marry her also**  - Abram would take Hagar as a second wife, but Hagar would not have the full status of a wife as Sarai did. She was still Sarai's servant.
    * **have a child for me**  - Since Hagar was Sarai's servant, Sarai would be considered the mother of any children that Hagar bore.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:04-09|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:05|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:05-02|>>]]**


===== Ishmael Was Born [05-02] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-05-02.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


So **[[:en:key-terms/abraham|Abram]] married [[:en:key-terms/hagar|Hagar]]**. Hagar had a baby boy, and Abram named him **[[:en:key-terms/ishmael|Ishmael]]**. But **[[:en:key-terms/sarah|Sarai]] became jealous of Hagar**. When Ishmael was thirteen years old, **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** again spoke to Abram.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **married**  - Hagar became Abram's concubine–a “second wife” of lower status. Hagar was still Sarai's servant.
    * **became jealous of Hagar**  - Sarai was jealous of Hagar because Hagar could have children and Sarai could not.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:05-01|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:05|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:05-03|>>]]**


===== God Renewed the Covenant [05-03] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-05-03.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


God said, “I am **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** Almighty. I will make a **[[:en:key-terms/covenant|covenant]]** with you.” Then **[[:en:key-terms/abraham|Abram]]** bowed to the ground. God also told Abram, “You will be the **father of many nations**. I will give you and your **[[:en:key-terms/descendant|descendants]]** the land of **[[:en:key-terms/canaan|Canaan]]** as their possession and **I will be their God**  forever. You must **[[:en:key-terms/circumcise|circumcise]]****every male in your family**.”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **father of many nations**  - Abram would have many descendants, and they would have their own lands and rule themselves. They and others would remember that Abram was their ancestor and would honor him.
    * **I will be their God**  - Another way to say this is, “I will be the God that they will worship.”
    * **every male in your family**  - This could be translated as, “every boy and man in your family.” This included Abram's servants and his descendants.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:05-02|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:05|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:05-04|>>]]**


===== God Promised Isaac's Birth [05-04] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-05-04.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


“Your wife, **[[:en:key-terms/sarah|Sarai]]**, will have a son—he will be the **[[:en:key-terms/son|son]] of [[:en:key-terms/promise|promise]]**. Name him **[[:en:key-terms/isaac|Isaac]]**. **I will make my [[:en:key-terms/covenant|covenant]] with him**, and he will become a great nation. I will make **[[:en:key-terms/ishmael|Ishmael]]** a great nation, too, but my covenant will be with Isaac.” Then **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** changed **[[:en:key-terms/abraham|Abram's]]** name to **[[:en:key-terms/abraham|Abraham]]**, which means “**father of many**.” God also changed Sarai's name to **[[:en:key-terms/sarah|Sarah]]**, which means “**princess**.”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * (God continues to speak to Abram.)


    * **son of promise**  - Isaac would be the son that God promised to Sarai and Abram. He would also be the son that God would use to give Abram many descendants.
    * **I will make my covenant with him**  - This would be the same covenant that God made with Abram.
    * **father of many**  - As God had promised, Abraham would become the ancestor of many people who would even become many nations.
    * **princess**  - A princess is a daughter of a king. The names Sarai and Sarah apparently both meant “princess.” But God changed her name to signify that she would be the mother of many nations, and some of her descendants would be kings.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:05-03|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:05|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:05-05|>>]]**


===== Birth of Isaac [05-05] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-05-05.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


That day **[[:en:key-terms/abraham|Abraham]]** **[[:en:key-terms/circumcise|circumcised]]****all the males in his household**. About a year later, when Abraham was 100 years old and **[[:en:key-terms/sarah|Sarah]]** was 90, Sarah gave birth to Abraham's **[[:en:key-terms/son|son]]**. They named him **[[:en:key-terms/isaac|Isaac]]** as **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** had told them to do.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **all the males in his household**  - This means all of the men and boys that Abraham was responsible for, including his male servants, young and old.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:05-04|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:05|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:05-06|>>]]**


===== Test of Faith [05-06] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-05-06.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


When **[[:en:key-terms/isaac|Isaac]]** was a young man, **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]] tested [[:en:key-terms/abraham|Abraham's]] [[:en:key-terms/faith|faith]]** by saying, “Take Isaac, your only **[[:en:key-terms/son|son]]**, and **kill him**  as a **[[:en:key-terms/sacrifice|sacrifice]]** to me.” Again Abraham **[[:en:key-terms/obey|obeyed]]** God and **prepared to sacrifice**  his son.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **God tested Abraham's faith**  - God wanted Abraham to show that he was completely submitted to God, that he would obey whatever God told him to do.
    * **kill him**  - God did not want human sacrifice. God wanted to see that Abraham loved God more than he loved his son and would obey God even when God told him to give his son back to God.
    * **prepared to sacrifice**  - Abraham got ready to sacrifice his son. God stopped him before he killed his son.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:05-05|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:05|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:05-07|>>]]**


===== God Will Provide [05-07] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-05-07.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


As **[[:en:key-terms/abraham|Abraham]]** and **[[:en:key-terms/isaac|Isaac]]****walked to the place of [[:en:key-terms/sacrifice|sacrifice]]**, Isaac asked, “Father, we have **wood for the sacrifice**, but where is **the [[:en:key-terms/lamb|lamb]]**?” Abraham replied, “**[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** will provide the lamb for the sacrifice, my son.”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **walked to the place of sacrifice**  - God had told Abraham to sacrifice Isaac on a special high hill that was about three days' walk from where they lived.
    * **wood for the sacrifice**  - For a sacrifice, normally the lamb was killed and then placed on top of wood so that the wood and the lamb could be burned up with fire.
    * **the lamb**  - A young sheep or goat would be the normal animal for a sacrifice.
    * **provide**  - Abraham may have believed that Isaac was the “lamb” that God provided, although God fulfilled Abraham's words by providing a ram to sacrifice in Isaac's place.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:05-06|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:05|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:05-08|>>]]**


===== The Sacrifice [05-08] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-05-08.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


When they reached the place of **[[:en:key-terms/sacrifice|sacrifice]]**, **[[:en:key-terms/abraham|Abraham]]** tied up his **[[:en:key-terms/son|son]]** **[[:en:key-terms/isaac|Isaac]]** and laid him on an **[[:en:key-terms/altar|altar]]**. He was about to **kill his son**  when **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** said, “**Stop! Do not hurt the boy!**  Now I know that **you fear me**  because you did not keep **your only son**  from me.”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **kill his son**  - God did not want human sacrifice. God wanted to see that Abraham loved God more than he loved his son and would obey God even when God told him to give his son back to God.
    * **Stop! Do no hurt the boy!**  - God protected Isaac and kept Abraham from killing him.
    * **you fear me**  - Abraham feared God, which included respect and reverence for God. Because of those things, he obeyed God.
    * **your only son**  - Ishmael was also Abraham's son, but Isaac was the only son of Abraham and Sarah. God's covenant was with Isaac and it was through Isaac that God would fulfill his promise.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:05-07|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:05|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:05-09|>>]]**


===== The Ram [05-09] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-05-09.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Nearby **[[:en:key-terms/abraham|Abraham]]** saw **a ram**  that was stuck in a bush. **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]] had provided the ram**to be the **[[:en:key-terms/sacrifice|sacrifice]]** instead of **[[:en:key-terms/isaac|Isaac]]**. Abraham happily offered the ram as a sacrifice.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **a ram**  - A ram is a male goat. Goats were one of the animals that people could sacrifice to God.
    * **God had provided the ram**  - Just at the right moment, God caused the ram to be stuck in the bush.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:05-08|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:05|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:05-10|>>]]**


===== The Blessing [05-10] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-05-10.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Then **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** said to **[[:en:key-terms/abraham|Abraham]]**, “Because you were willing to give me everything, even **your only [[:en:key-terms/son|son]]**, I **[[:en:key-terms/promise|promise]]** to **[[:en:key-terms/bless|bless]]** you. Your **[[:en:key-terms/descendant|descendants]]** will be more than **the stars in the sky**. Because you have **[[:en:key-terms/obey|obeyed]]** me, **all the families of the world**  will be **blessed through your family**.”


//A Bible story from: Genesis 16-22//


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **your only son**  - See explanation in **[[:en:obs:notes:frames:05-08|[05-08]]]**.
    * **the stars in the sky**  - See explanation in **[[:en:obs:notes:frames:04-05|[04-05]]]**.
    * **all the families of the world**  - Here, “families” refers to the larger distinct groups of people on earth, rather than to each set of parents and children.
    * **blessed through your family**  - Here, “family” refers to the many descendants that Abraham would have. The future generations of the world would be blessed through Abraham's descendants. The greatest blessing would come many generations later through God's chosen servant, the Messiah.
    * //A Bible story from//  - These references may be slightly different in some Bible translations.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:05-09|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:05|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:06-01|>>]]**


===== A Wife for Isaac [06-01] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-06-01.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


When **[[:en:key-terms/abraham|Abraham]]** was very old, his **[[:en:key-terms/son|son]]**, **[[:en:key-terms/isaac|Isaac]]**, had grown to be a man. So Abraham **sent one of his [[:en:key-terms/servant|servants]] back****to the land**  where his relatives lived **to bring back a wife for his son, Isaac**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **sent one of his servants back**  – This could be translated as, “told one of his servants to go back.” The word “back” means that the servant would be going to the same place where Abraham used to live long ago before he came to Canaan. Make sure the translation of this phrase makes that clear.
    * **to the land**  - This land was east of where Abraham was now living.
    * **to bring back a wife for his son, Isaac**  - This could be translated as, “to bring back an unmarried woman for his son, Isaac, to marry”.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:05-10|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:06|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:06-02|>>]]**


===== Finding Rebekah [06-02] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-06-02.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


After a very long journey to the land where **[[:en:key-terms/abraham|Abraham's]]** relatives lived, **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** led the **[[:en:key-terms/servant|servant]]** to **[[:en:key-terms/rebekah|Rebekah]]**. She was the **granddaughter of Abraham's brother**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **granddaughter of Abraham's brother**  - Specifically, she was the daughter of Abraham's brother's son. Her grandfather was Abraham's brother.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:06-01|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:06|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:06-03|>>]]**


===== Isaac Married Rebekah [06-03] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-06-03.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**[[:en:key-terms/rebekah|Rebekah]] agreed**to leave her family and go back with the **[[:en:key-terms/servant|servant]]** to **[[:en:key-terms/isaac|Isaac's]]** home. Isaac married her as soon as she arrived.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **Rebekah agreed**  - Even though Rebekah's parents were arranging her marriage, they did not force her to go marry Isaac.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:06-02|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:06|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:06-04|>>]]**


===== Rebekah Was Childless [06-04] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-06-04.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


After a long time, **[[:en:key-terms/abraham|Abraham]]** died and all of **the [[:en:key-terms/promise|promises]] that [[:en:key-terms/god|God]] had made to him in the [[:en:key-terms/covenant|covenant]] were passed on**to **[[:en:key-terms/isaac|Isaac]]**. God had promised that Abraham would have **countless [[:en:key-terms/descendant|descendants]]**, but Isaac's wife, **[[:en:key-terms/rebekah|Rebekah]]**, could not have children.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **the promises … were passed on**  - The promises of the covenant that God made with Abraham were not for him only, but also for his descendants.
    * **countless**  - This could also be translated as, “very many.” The word “countless” means there would be so many descendants that people would not be able to count them.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:06-03|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:06|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:06-05|>>]]**


===== Rebekah Became Pregnant [06-05] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-06-05.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**[[:en:key-terms/isaac|Isaac]]** prayed for **[[:en:key-terms/rebekah|Rebekah]]**, and **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** allowed her to get pregnant with twins. The two babies struggled with each other while they were still **in Rebekah's womb**, so Rebekah asked God what was happening.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **in Rebekah's womb**  - That is, “inside her.”

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:06-04|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:06|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:06-06|>>]]**


===== Two Nations [06-06] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-06-06.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** told **[[:en:key-terms/rebekah|Rebekah]]**, “Two nations will come **from the two sons**  inside of you. **They will struggle with each other**  and **the older [[:en:key-terms/son|son]]** will **serve the younger one**.”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **from the two sons**  - That is, “from the descendants of the two sons.”
    * **They will struggle with each other**  - Both the two sons and the nations that will come from them will continually fight with each other. Compare to **[[:en:obs:notes:frames:06-05|[06-05]]]**.
    * **the older son**  - Even though the babies were twins, the baby that came out first would be treated as the older son.
    * **serve the younger one**  – This could be translated as, “the older son will have to do what the younger one tells him to do.”

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:06-05|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:06|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:06-07|>>]]**


===== Twins Were Born [06-07] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-06-07.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


When **[[:en:key-terms/rebekah|Rebekah's]] babies were born**, **the older [[:en:key-terms/son|son]]** came out **red**  and **hairy**, and they named him **[[:en:key-terms/esau|Esau]]**. Then **the younger son**  came out holding on to Esau's heel, and they named him **[[:en:key-terms/jacob|Jacob]]**.


//A Bible story from: Genesis 24:1-25:26//


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **Rebekah's babies were born**  - Some languages have a more indirect way of saying this such as, “when Rebekah saw and took them” or, “when Rebekah brought them to light.”
    * **the older son … the younger son**  - This could be translated as, “the first son to come out … the second son to come out.” Make sure that the way “older” and “younger” are translated still communicates that the boys were twins.
    * **red**  - This may mean that his skin was very red or that the hair on his body was red.
    * **hairy**  - Esau had a lot of hair on his body. You could say, “the older son's body was red, with lots of hair.”
    * //A Bible story from//  - These references may be slightly different in some Bible translations.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:06-06|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:06|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:07-01|>>]]**


===== The Boys Grew Up [07-01] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-07-01.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


As the boys grew up, **[[:en:key-terms/jacob|Jacob]] loved to stay at home**, but **[[:en:key-terms/esau|Esau]] loved to hunt**. **[[:en:key-terms/rebekah|Rebekah]] loved Jacob**, **but [[:en:key-terms/isaac|Isaac]] loved Esau**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **loved to stay at home … loved to hunt**  - Some languages will use a word for “love” here that is different from the one used for, “Rebekah loved Jacob.” For example, this could be translated as, “liked to stay at home … liked to hunt” or, “preferred to stay at home … preferred to hunt.”
    * **at home**  - This expression refers to the area around the family dwellings. Jacob preferred to stay close to the tents where they lived. Some languages have a special expression for, “at home.”
    * **Rebekah loved Jacob, but Isaac loved Esau**  - This could be translated as, “Rebekah was more fond of Jacob, and Isaac was more fond of Esau.” This does not necessarily mean that Rebekah and Isaac did not love the other son, but that each parent had a favorite.

===== Esau Sold His Rights [07-02] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-07-02.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


One day, when **[[:en:key-terms/esau|Esau]]** came back from hunting, he was very hungry. Esau said to **[[:en:key-terms/jacob|Jacob]]**, “Please **give me some of the food**  you have made.” Jacob responded, “First, **give me your rights as the oldest son**.” So Esau gave Jacob his **rights as the oldest son**. Then Jacob gave him some food.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **give me some of the food … give me your rights**  – Some languages may prefer to use two different words for “give” here. This would also apply to, “Esau gave … Jacob gave” in the last two sentences.
    * **rights as the oldest son**  - According to their custom, since Esau was the oldest son, he should have been the one to receive twice as much of their father's wealth when their father died. Jacob thought of a way to take these rights of the oldest son from Esau.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:07-01|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:07|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:07-03|>>]]**


===== Rebekah and Jacob Tricked Isaac [07-03] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-07-03.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**[[:en:key-terms/isaac|Isaac]]** wanted to **give his [[:en:key-terms/bless|blessing]]** to **[[:en:key-terms/esau|Esau]]**. But before he did, **[[:en:key-terms/rebekah|Rebekah]]** and **[[:en:key-terms/jacob|Jacob]] tricked him**by having Jacob **pretend**  to be Esau. Isaac was old and could no longer see. So Jacob put on Esau’s clothes and put **goatskins**  on his neck and hands.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **give his blessing**  - It was customary for fathers to formally express their desire for good things to happen to their children. Normally the older son received the best promise. Isaac wanted this extra prosperity to happen to Esau.
    * **tricked him**  - The word “trick” means to do something to deliberately deceive someone. Rebekah came up with a plan to deceive Isaac into giving Jacob the special blessing instead of Esau.
    * **pretend**  - The word “pretend” shows how Jacob would deceive his father (who had very poor eyesight in his old age).
    * **goatskins**  - The hairiness of the goatskins would make Jacob feel like Esau.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:07-02|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:07|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:07-04|>>]]**


===== Isaac Blessed Jacob [07-04] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-07-04.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**[[:en:key-terms/jacob|Jacob]] came to [[:en:key-terms/isaac|Isaac]]** and said, “I am **[[:en:key-terms/esau|Esau]]**. I have come so that you can **[[:en:key-terms/bless|bless]]** me.” When Isaac felt the goat hair and smelled the clothes, **he thought it was Esau**  and blessed him.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **Jacob came to Isaac**  - In some languages it might be more natural to say, “Jacob went to Isaac.”
    * **he thought it was Esau**  - He thought that the person he was touching and smelling was Esau.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:07-03|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:07|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:07-05|>>]]**


===== Esau Hated Jacob [07-05] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-07-05.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**[[:en:key-terms/esau|Esau]]** hated **[[:en:key-terms/jacob|Jacob]]** because Jacob had stolen his **rights as oldest son**  and also **his [[:en:key-terms/bless|blessing]]**. So he planned to kill Jacob after their father died.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **rights as oldest son**  - Jacob found a way to get the larger portion of their father's wealth that should have gone to Esau as the older son. See also note on **[[:en:obs:notes:frames:07-02|[07-02]]]**.
    * **his blessing**  - Jacob also tricked their father into giving him the promise of extra prosperity that Isaac intended to give to Esau. See also note on **[[:en:obs:notes:frames:07-03|[07-03]]]**.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:07-04|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:07|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:07-06|>>]]**


===== Isaac Sent Jacob Away [07-06] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-07-06.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


But **[[:en:key-terms/rebekah|Rebekah]]** heard of **[[:en:key-terms/esau|Esau’s]] plan**. So **she and [[:en:key-terms/isaac|Isaac]] sent [[:en:key-terms/jacob|Jacob]] far away to live with her relatives**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **Esau's plan**  - Esau's plan was to kill Jacob after his father died.
    * **she and Isaac sent Jacob**  – Rebekah wanted to protect Jacob from Esau so she talked to Isaac about sending Jacob away.
    * **far away to live with her relatives**  - This was the same place where Rebekah was living when Abraham's servant got her to be Isaac's wife. To make this clear, you could add, “relatives in the same land where she used to live.” The land was to the east, several hundred miles away.
    * **her relatives**  - This could also be translated as, “their relatives.” Since Abraham's brother was Rebekah's grandfather, her relatives were also Isaac's relatives.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:07-05|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:07|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:07-07|>>]]**


===== Jacob Prospered [07-07] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-07-07.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**[[:en:key-terms/jacob|Jacob]]** lived with **[[:en:key-terms/rebekah|Rebekah's]]** relatives for many years. During that time he married and had twelve sons and a daughter. **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** made him very **wealthy**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **wealthy**  – This included money, large herds of animals and other possessions.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:07-06|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:07|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:07-08|>>]]**


===== Jacob Returned Home [07-08] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-07-08.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**After twenty years**  away from his home in **[[:en:key-terms/canaan|Canaan]]**, **[[:en:key-terms/jacob|Jacob]]** returned there with his family, his **[[:en:key-terms/servant|servants]]**, and all his herds of animals.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **after twenty years**  - Jacob had lived for twenty years in the land where his mother was from. If that is not clear you could say, “After twenty years living in the land where his relatives were.”

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:07-07|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:07|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:07-09|>>]]**


===== Jacob Met Esau [07-09] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-07-09.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**[[:en:key-terms/jacob|Jacob]]** was very afraid because he thought **[[:en:key-terms/esau|Esau]]** still wanted to kill him. So he sent many herds of animals to Esau as a gift. The **[[:en:key-terms/servant|servants]]** who brought the animals said to Esau, “**Your servant, Jacob**, is giving you these animals. He is coming soon.”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **your servant, Jacob**  - Jacob was not actually Esau's servant. But Jacob told his servants to say this because he wanted to show Esau that he was coming to him humbly and respectfully, so that Esau would no longer be angry with him.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:07-08|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:07|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:07-10|>>]]**


===== The Brothers Were Reunited [07-10] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-07-10.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


But **[[:en:key-terms/esau|Esau]]** had already **[[:en:key-terms/forgive|forgiven]]** **[[:en:key-terms/jacob|Jacob]]**, and they were happy to see each other again. Jacob then **lived [[:en:key-terms/peace|peacefully]]** in **[[:en:key-terms/canaan|Canaan]]**. Then **[[:en:key-terms/isaac|Isaac]]** died, and Jacob and Esau **buried him**. The **[[:en:key-terms/covenant|covenant]]** **[[:en:key-terms/promise|promises]]** **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** had promised to **[[:en:key-terms/abraham|Abraham]]** now **passed on from Isaac to Jacob**.


//A Bible story from: Genesis 25:27-33:20//


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **lived peacefully**  - This refers to the fact that Esau and Jacob were not angry at each other and did not fight with each other.
    * **buried him**  - This could mean that they dug a hole in the ground, placed Isaac's body in it, and covered the hole with dirt or stones. Or it could mean that they placed Isaac's body in a cave and covered the opening.
    * **covenant promises**  - These were the promises that God made in his covenant with Abraham.
    * **passed on from Isaac to Jacob**  - The promises went from Abraham to his son Isaac, and now to Isaac's son Jacob. Esau did not receive the promises. See also **[[:en:obs:notes:frames:06-04|[06-04]]]**.
    * //A Bible story from//  - These references may be slightly different in some Bible translations.

===== Joseph, the Favorite Son [08-01] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-08-02.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Many years later, when **[[:en:key-terms/jacob|Jacob]]** was an old man, he **sent**  his **favorite son**, **[[:en:key-terms/joseph|Joseph]]**, to **check on**  his **brothers**  who were **taking care of the herds**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **sent**  – This word means that Jacob told Joseph to go and Joseph went.
    * **favorite son**  - This could be translated as, “the son he loved more than any of his other children.”
    * **check on**  - This means that Joseph is to go and see if everything is all right with his brothers. Some languages might say something like, “to see his brothers' well-being.”
    * **brothers**  - These were Joseph's older brothers.
    * **taking care of the herds**  – Since this was several days' journey away, it may be necessary to say, “who were far away taking care of.”

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:07-10|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:08|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:08-02|>>]]**


===== Joseph Was Sold as a Slave [08-02] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-08-01.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**[[:en:key-terms/joseph|Joseph’s]]** brothers hated him because their father loved him most and because Joseph had **[[:en:key-terms/dream|dreamed]]** that he would be their ruler. When Joseph **came to his brothers**, they **kidnapped**  him and sold him to some **[[:en:key-terms/servant|slave]] traders**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **came to his brothers**  – Another way this could be translated is, “reached the place where his brothers were.”
    * **kidnapped**  - They took him against his will. It was not right for them to do this.
    * **slave traders**  - These were people who made a business of buying people from one owner and selling them as slaves to another owner.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:08-01|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:08|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:08-03|>>]]**


===== The Brothers' Lie [08-03] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-08-03.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Before **[[:en:key-terms/joseph|Joseph’s]]** brothers returned home, they tore Joseph’s robe and dipped it in **goat's blood**. Then they showed the robe to their father so he would think that a wild animal had killed Joseph. **[[:en:key-terms/jacob|Jacob]]** was very sad.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **goat's blood**  - The brothers wanted Jacob to think that the blood on the clothes was Joseph's blood.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:08-02|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:08|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:08-04|>>]]**


===== Joseph in Egypt [08-04] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-08-04.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


The **[[:en:key-terms/servant|slave]]** traders took **[[:en:key-terms/joseph|Joseph]]** to **[[:en:key-terms/egypt|Egypt]]**. Egypt was a large, powerful country located along the **[[:en:key-terms/nile-river|Nile River]]**. The slave traders sold Joseph as a slave to a wealthy **government official**. Joseph served his master well, and **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** **[[:en:key-terms/bless|blessed]]** Joseph.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **government official**  - This was a person who was part of the Egyptian government. Another way to say this would be, “a leader in Egypt's government.”

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:08-03|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:08|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:08-05|>>]]**


===== Joseph in Prison [08-05] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-08-05.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


His master’s wife **tried to sleep with [[:en:key-terms/joseph|Joseph]]**, but Joseph refused to **[[:en:key-terms/sin|sin]] against [[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** in this way. She became angry and falsely accused Joseph so that he was arrested and sent to prison. Even in prison, Joseph **remained [[:en:key-terms/faithful|faithful]] to God**, and God **[[:en:key-terms/bless|blessed]]** him.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **tried to sleep with Joseph**  – Another way to say this would be, “tried to seduce Joseph to have sex with her.” To “sleep with” is a way of expressing this in order not to be crude or offensive.
    * **sin against God**  - It is against God's law for people to have sex if they are not married to each other. Joseph did not want to sin by disobeying God's law.
    * **remained faithful to God**  - Another way to say this would be, “continued to obey God.”

===== Pharaoh's Dream [08-06] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-08-06.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


After two years, **[[:en:key-terms/joseph|Joseph]]** was still in prison, even though he was **[[:en:key-terms/innocent|innocent]]**. One night, the **[[:en:key-terms/pharaoh|Pharaoh]]**, which is what the **[[:en:key-terms/egypt|Egyptians]]** called their **[[:en:key-terms/king|kings]]**, had two **[[:en:key-terms/dream|dreams]]** that **disturbed him greatly**. None of **his advisors**  could tell him the **meaning of the dreams**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **disturbed him greatly**  – This means that the king felt very afraid and confused (because of what he had seen in the dreams).
    * **his advisors**  - These were men with special powers and knowledge who could sometimes tell what dreams meant. Some translations refer to them as, “wise men.”
    * **meaning of the dreams**  - People in Egypt believed that dreams were messages from the gods telling them about what would happen in the future. God used Pharaoh's dreams to tell him what would happen.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:08-05|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:08|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:08-07|>>]]**


===== Joseph Interpreted the Dream [08-07] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-08-07.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** had given **[[:en:key-terms/joseph|Joseph]]** the ability to **interpret [[:en:key-terms/dream|dreams]]**, so **[[:en:key-terms/pharaoh|Pharaoh]] had Joseph brought to him**from the prison. Joseph interpreted the dreams for him and said, “**God is going to send**  seven years of plentiful harvests, followed by seven years of **famine**.”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **interpret dreams**  - To “interpret” is to tell what something means. So Joseph was able to tell people what their dreams meant.
    * **had Joseph brought to him**  - Another way to say this would be, “ordered his servants to bring Joseph to him.”
    * **God is going to send**  - God will cause the crops to grow well for seven years, and after that He will cause them to produce very little food so that the people and animals will not have enough to eat.
    * **famine**  - The gardens and fields would produce so little food that people and animals would not have enough to eat.

===== Joseph Ruled Egypt [08-08] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-08-08.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**[[:en:key-terms/pharaoh|Pharaoh]]** was so **impressed with [[:en:key-terms/joseph|Joseph]]** that he appointed him to be the **second most powerful man**  in all of **[[:en:key-terms/egypt|Egypt]]**!


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **impressed with**  - Pharaoh was amazed by Joseph's wisdom and felt respect for him; he trusted Joseph to make wise decisions that would benefit the people. It may be clearer to say, “impressed with Joseph's wisdom.”
    * **second most powerful man**  - Pharaoh made Joseph a very powerful and important ruler over all of Egypt. Only Pharaoh was more powerful and important than Joseph.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:08-07|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:08|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:08-09|>>]]**


===== Joseph Stored Up Food [08-09] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-08-09.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**[[:en:key-terms/joseph|Joseph]]** told the people to **store up large amounts of food**  during the seven years of good harvests. Then Joseph sold the food to the people when the seven years of **famine**  came so they would have enough to eat.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **store up large amounts of food**  - They took food from the abundant harvests to the cities and stored it there. The food then belonged to Pharaoh.
    * **famine**  - See how you translated this in **[[:en:obs:notes:frames:08-07|[08-07]]]**.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:08-08|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:08|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:08-10|>>]]**


===== The Famine [08-10] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-08-10.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**The famine was severe**  not only in **[[:en:key-terms/egypt|Egypt]]**, but also in **[[:en:key-terms/canaan|Canaan]]** where **[[:en:key-terms/jacob|Jacob]]** and his family lived.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **Egypt, but also Canaan**  – For some languages it may be clearer or more natural to say, “the country of Egypt, but also the land of Canaan.”
    * **The famine was severe**  - The famine was very bad. There was very little food and many people outside of Egypt were starving.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:08-09|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:08|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:08-11|>>]]**


===== The Brothers Bought Food [08-11] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-08-11.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


So **[[:en:key-terms/jacob|Jacob]]** sent **his older sons**  to **[[:en:key-terms/egypt|Egypt]]** to buy food. The brothers **did not recognize [[:en:key-terms/joseph|Joseph]]** when they stood before him to buy food. But Joseph recognized them.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **his older sons**  - These were Joseph's older brothers who had sold him into slavery.
    * **did not recognize Joseph**  - They did not know that the man was Joseph, because now Joseph was much older than when they last saw him, and he was dressed as an Egyptian ruler.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:08-10|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:08|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:08-12|>>]]**


===== Joseph Met His Brothers [08-12] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-08-12.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


After **testing his brothers**  to see **if they had changed**, **[[:en:key-terms/joseph|Joseph]]** said to them, “I am your brother, Joseph! **Do not be afraid**. You tried to do **[[:en:key-terms/evil|evil]]** when you sold me as a **[[:en:key-terms/servant|slave]]**, but **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** used the **evil for [[:en:key-terms/good|good]]**! Come and live in **[[:en:key-terms/egypt|Egypt]]** so I can provide for you and your families.”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **testing his brothers**  - Joseph placed his older brothers in a difficult situation to see if they would protect their youngest brother, or treat him as badly as they had treated Joseph. When they protected their youngest brother, Joseph knew they had changed.
    * **if they had changed**  - Another way to say this would be, “if they were different than they used to be.” Years ago Joseph's brothers sold him into slavery. Joseph wanted to find out if they would now do what was right.
    * **do not be afraid**  - Another way to say this would be, “You do not need to fear any punishment from me.” Joseph's brothers were afraid because they had greatly wronged Joseph and now as a great ruler he had the power to punish them. Joseph could refuse to sell them food, or even put them in prison or kill them.
    * **evil for good**  - Joseph's brothers did an evil thing when they sold Joseph as a slave and he was taken to Egypt. But God allowed this so that Joseph could save thousands of people from starving during the famine, including his own family. This was a very good thing.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:08-11|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:08|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:08-13|>>]]**

==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **Even though Jacob was an old man, he moved to Egypt**  - Egypt was a great distance away from Canaan, and it would have been difficult for an elderly man to walk or ride a cart that far.
    * **Before Jacob died**  - Jacob died in Egypt. He did not get to return to Canaan, the land God had promised to give to him and his descendants.

The **[[:en:key-terms/covenant|covenant]]** **[[:en:key-terms/promise|promises]]** that **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** gave to **[[:en:key-terms/abraham|Abraham]]** were **passed on to**  **[[:en:key-terms/isaac|Isaac]]**, then to **[[:en:key-terms/jacob|Jacob]]**, and then to Jacob’s twelve sons and their families. The **[[:en:key-terms/descendant|descendants]]** of the twelve sons became the **twelve tribes of [[:en:key-terms/israel|Israel]]**.


//A Bible story from: Genesis 37-50//


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **covenant promises**  - Long ago God made an agreement with Abraham and promised him that he would give him many descendants; they would possess the land of Canaan and become a great nation. God also promised that all peoples would be blessed through Abraham's line. See also **[[:en:obs:notes:frames:07-10|[07-10]]]**.
    * **passed on to**  - Another way to say this would be, “passed down to” or, “given to” or, “applied to.” God's promise to Abraham was also for Abraham's children, grandchildren and all the rest of his descendants. See also **[[:en:obs:notes:frames:06-04|[06-04]]]**.
    * **twelve tribes of Israel**  - God had promised Abraham, Isaac and Jacob that their descendants would become a great nation. God later changed Jacob's name to Israel. The descendants of Jacob's 12 sons became 12 great tribes. These 12 tribes made up the ancient nation called Israel, which was named by Jacob's new name.

==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **called the Israelites**  - The people group that descended from Jacob was called “Israel,” which is the name that God gave to Jacob. The people from that group were called “Israelites.”

After hundreds of years, the number of **[[:en:key-terms/israel|Israelites]]** had become very large. The **[[:en:key-terms/egypt|Egyptians]]** no longer remembered **[[:en:key-terms/joseph|Joseph]]** and all he had done to help them. They became afraid of the Israelites because there were so many of them. So the **[[:en:key-terms/pharaoh|Pharaoh]]** who was ruling Egypt at that time **made the Israelites [[:en:key-terms/servant|slaves]]** to the Egyptians.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **Pharaoh**  – “Pharaoh” is an Egyptian word that refers to their king. This Pharaoh was probably the son of a former Pharaoh who had died, who may have been a descendant of the Pharaoh that Joseph knew.
    * **made the Israelites slaves**  - That is, “forced the Israelites to do hard labor against their will and treated them very harshly.”

The **[[:en:key-terms/egypt|Egyptians]]** forced the **[[:en:key-terms/israel|Israelites]]** to build many buildings and even whole cities. The hard work made their lives **miserable**, but **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]] [[:en:key-terms/bless|blessed]] them**, and they had even more children.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **miserable**  – This means that they suffered terribly because of how harshly they were treated and how hard they were forced to work. They also felt very discouraged.
    * **God blessed them**  - God took care of them, helping them endure the severe treatment and even caused them to become more numerous by giving them children.

**[[:en:key-terms/pharaoh|Pharaoh]] saw**that the **[[:en:key-terms/israel|Israelites]]** were having many babies, so he ordered his people to kill all Israelite baby boys by throwing them into the **[[:en:key-terms/nile-river|Nile River]]**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **saw**  – Another way to say this would be, “realized” or, “knew.”

When the child was old enough that he no longer needed his mother's milk, she returned him to Pharaoh’s daughter, who named him **[[:en:key-terms/moses|Moses]]**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **took him as her own son**  - She was a princess. When she made him her son, he became a prince of Egypt.
    * **to nurse him**  - Another way to say this would be, “to breastfeed him.”

==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **grown up**  - Another way to say this would be, “grown into a man.”
    * **fellow Israelite**  - This phrase refers to the Israelite slave. The word “fellow” here indicates that Moses was also an Israelite. Although the daughter of the Egyptian Pharaoh raised Moses, Moses remembered that he was really an Israelite.

When **[[:en:key-terms/pharaoh|Pharaoh]]** heard what **[[:en:key-terms/moses|Moses]]** had done, he tried to kill him. Moses ran away from **[[:en:key-terms/egypt|Egypt]]** to the **wilderness**  where he would be safe from Pharaoh's soldiers.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **wilderness**  - The wilderness was a large area that was rocky and dry. The land there was not good for growing food and few people lived there.

Moses went towards the bush to be able to see it better. As he approached the burning bush, **the voice of [[:en:key-terms/god|God]] said**, “Moses, **take off your shoes**. You are standing on **[[:en:key-terms/holy|holy]] ground**.”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **taking care of his sheep**  - This means he was doing the work of a shepherd to guide the sheep to grass and water, and to protect them. It could be translated as, “tending the sheep.”
    * **bush did not burn up**  - God made the bush full of fire, but the fire did not damage the bush.
    * **the voice of God said**  - This could be translated as, “God said out loud.” Moses heard God speak, but he did not see God.
    * **take off your shoes**  - God wanted him to take off his shoes to show that he greatly respected God. To make clear the reason for this, you could say, “take off your shoes, because you are on holy ground.”
    * **holy ground**  - It was holy in the sense that God set it apart from the ordinary land and made it to be a special place where He would reveal Himself.

===== God Sent Moses to Egypt [09-13] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-09-13.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** said, “I have seen the **[[:en:key-terms/suffer|suffering]] of my people**. I will send you to **[[:en:key-terms/pharaoh|Pharaoh]]** so that you can **bring the [[:en:key-terms/israel|Israelites]] out of their [[:en:key-terms/servant|slavery]] in [[:en:key-terms/egypt|Egypt]]**. I will give them the land of **[[:en:key-terms/canaan|Canaan]]**, the land I **[[:en:key-terms/promise|promised]]** to **[[:en:key-terms/abraham|Abraham]]**, **[[:en:key-terms/isaac|Isaac]]**, and **[[:en:key-terms/jacob|Jacob]]**.”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **suffering of my people**  - This could be translated as, “the very harsh treatment that my people are experiencing. Some languages might translate this as, “how the Egyptians are giving my people terrible pain.”
    * **my people**  - This refers to the Israelites. God had made a covenant with Abraham and his descendants that He would bless them and make them into a great nation. Through this covenant, the Israelites became God's own people.
    * **bring … out of their slavery in Egypt**  - This can be translated as, “set them free from being slaves in Egypt” or, “bring them out of Egypt where they are now slaves.”

===== The Name of God [09-14] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-09-14.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**[[:en:key-terms/moses|Moses]]** asked, “What if **the people**  want to know who sent me, what should I say?” **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** said, “**I AM WHO I AM**. Tell them, ‘**I AM**  has sent me to you.’ Also tell them, 'I am **[[:en:key-terms/yahweh|Yahweh]]**, the God of your ancestors **[[:en:key-terms/abraham|Abraham]]**, **[[:en:key-terms/isaac|Isaac]]**, and **[[:en:key-terms/jacob|Jacob]]**.' This is **my name**  forever.”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **the people**  - See “my people” in **[[:en:obs:notes:frames:09-13|[09-13]]]**.
    * **I AM WHO I AM**  - This description shows that God can only be defined by himself, not by anything else that we know of, and he cannot be compared to anyone else.
    * **I AM**  - This name emphasizes that God is the only one who has always lived and always will live.
    * **my name**  - The name that God told Moses and all of Israel to use for him is “Yahweh,” which is related to “I AM” and appears to mean, “HE IS.”

===== Aaron Helped Moses [09-15] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-09-15.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**[[:en:key-terms/moses|Moses]] was afraid and did not want to go**to **[[:en:key-terms/pharaoh|Pharaoh]]** because he thought he could not speak well, so **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** sent **Moses’ brother, [[:en:key-terms/aaron|Aaron]]**, to help him. God warned Moses and Aaron that Pharaoh would be **stubborn**.


//A Bible story from: Exodus 1-4//


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **was afraid and did not want to go**  - Moses knew that Pharaoh wanted to kill him, and he did not believe that he could do what God wanted him to do.
    * **Moses' brother, Aaron**  - Aaron was Moses's actual brother from his Israelite mother and father. Aaron would have been at least several years older than Moses.
    * **stubborn**  - This means the Pharaoh would refuse to obey God. You may also want to add, “stubborn and refuse to listen (or obey).”
    * //A Bible story from//  - These references may be slightly different in some Bible translations.

===== Let My People Go! [10-01] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-10-01.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**[[:en:key-terms/moses|Moses]]** and **[[:en:key-terms/aaron|Aaron]]** went **to [[:en:key-terms/pharaoh|Pharaoh]]**. They said, “This is what the **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]] of [[:en:key-terms/israel|Israel]]** says, ‘**Let my people go**!’” Pharaoh did not **listen to**  them. Instead of letting the **[[:en:key-terms/israel|Israelites]]** go free, he forced them to work even harder!


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **to Pharaoh**  – It may be clearer to say, “to Pharaoh's palace to talk to him.”
    * **God of Israel**  - This could be translated as, “God, who chose the Israelites to be his people” or, “God, who rules the people of Israel” or, “the God whom the Israelites worship.”
    * **Let My people go**  – Another way to say this would be, “Allow My people to go free” or, “Free My people to leave Egypt.”
    * **my people**  - See “my people” in **[[:en:obs:notes:frames:09-13|[09-13]]]**.
    * **listen to**  – This could be translated as “heed” or, “obey.”

===== Pharaoh Refused to Obey [10-02] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-10-02.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**[[:en:key-terms/pharaoh|Pharaoh]]** kept refusing to let **the people**  go, so **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** sent **ten terrible plagues**  on **[[:en:key-terms/egypt|Egypt]]**. Through these plagues, God showed Pharaoh that he is more powerful than Pharaoh and **all of Egypt's [[:en:key-terms/god-false|gods]]**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **the people**  - This refers to the people of Israel, also called, “the Israelites.”
    * **ten terrible plagues**  - A plague is something very bad or terrible that happens to someone or something. A plague usually refers to something that affects many people or happens over a large geographic area. Another word for “plague” would be “disaster.”
    * **all of Egypt's gods**  - It may be more clear to say, “all the gods that the Egyptian people worshiped.” The people of Egypt worshiped many different false gods. These false gods were either spirit beings that the God of Israel created, or they did not actually exist.

**[[:en:key-terms/god|God]] turned the [[:en:key-terms/nile-river|Nile River]] into blood**, but **[[:en:key-terms/pharaoh|Pharaoh]]** still would not let the **[[:en:key-terms/israel|Israelites]]** go.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **turned the Nile River into blood**  - Some languages may need to say, “turned the water in the Nile River into blood.” Instead of water in the river there was blood, so the fish died and the people had no water to drink.

{{:en:obs:obs-10-04.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

But after all the frogs died, Pharaoh **hardened his heart**  and would not let the **[[:en:key-terms/israel|Israelites]]** leave Egypt.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **God sent frogs all over Egypt**  - This could be translated as, “God caused many frogs to appear throughout Egypt.”
    * **hardened his heart**  - He became stubborn again and refused to obey God.

===== The Gnats and the Flies [10-05] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-10-05.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


So **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]] sent a plague**of **gnats**. Then he sent a plague of **flies**. **[[:en:key-terms/pharaoh|Pharaoh]]** called **[[:en:key-terms/moses|Moses]]** and **[[:en:key-terms/aaron|Aaron]]** and told them that if they stopped the plague, the **[[:en:key-terms/israel|Israelites]]** could leave Egypt. When Moses prayed, God removed all the flies from **[[:en:key-terms/egypt|Egypt]]**. But Pharaoh **hardened his heart**  and would not let the people go free.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **God sent a plague**  – This could be translated as, “God caused there to be a plague” or, “God caused a plague (of gnats) to come over the land of Egypt.”
    * **gnats**  - These were tiny, biting insects flying in large swarms, annoying and landing on all the people and animals of Egypt.
    * **flies**  - These were much bigger flying insects that were both annoying and destructive. There were so many of these flies that they covered everything, even filling the Egyptians' houses.
    * **hardened his heart**  - See note in **[[:en:obs:notes:frames:10-04|[10-04]]]**.

Next, **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** caused all the farm animals that belonged to the **[[:en:key-terms/egypt|Egyptians]]** to get sick and die. But **[[:en:key-terms/pharaoh|Pharaoh’s]] heart was hardened**, and he would not let the **[[:en:key-terms/israel|Israelites]]** go.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **farm animals**  - This refers to large animals that the Egyptians used to help them in their work, such as horses, donkeys, camels, cattle, sheep, and goats.
    * **heart was hardened**  - See note in **[[:en:obs:notes:frames:10-04|[10-04]]]**.

===== The Painful Sores [10-07] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-10-07.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Then **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** told **[[:en:key-terms/moses|Moses]]** to throw ashes into the air in front of **[[:en:key-terms/pharaoh|Pharaoh]]**. When he did, painful skin sores appeared on the **[[:en:key-terms/egypt|Egyptians]]**, but not on the **[[:en:key-terms/israel|Israelites]]**. **God hardened Pharaoh's heart**, and Pharaoh would not let the Israelites go free.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **God hardened Pharaoh's heart**  - God caused Pharaoh to continue to be stubborn. See also note in **[[:en:obs:notes:frames:10-04|[10-04]]]**.

**After that**, **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]] sent hail**that destroyed most of the crops in **[[:en:key-terms/egypt|Egypt]]** and killed anybody who went outside. **[[:en:key-terms/pharaoh|Pharaoh]]** called **[[:en:key-terms/moses|Moses]]** and **[[:en:key-terms/aaron|Aaron]]** and told them, “I have **[[:en:key-terms/sin|sinned]]**. **You may go**.” So Moses **[[:en:key-terms/pray|prayed]]**, and the hail stopped falling from the sky.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **After that**  - This means, after God caused the painful sores to appear on the Egyptians' skin.
    * **God sent hail**  - God caused hail to fall from the sky.
    * **hail**  - Hail is like chunks of ice that fall down from the clouds as rain does. These chunks can be very small or very large. The larger ones will hurt or kill whatever they fall on.
    * **You may go**  - The word “you” refers to Moses, Aaron, and the Israelites.

But **[[:en:key-terms/pharaoh|Pharaoh]]** **[[:en:key-terms/sin|sinned]]** again and **hardened his heart**. He would not let the **[[:en:key-terms/israel|Israelites]]** go free.

So **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** caused **swarms of locusts**  to come over **[[:en:key-terms/egypt|Egypt]]**. These **locusts**  ate all the crops that the **hail**  had not destroyed.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **swarms of locusts**  - Locusts are grasshoppers that fly together in swarms, or large groups, and that can destroy large areas of all kinds of plants and food crops by eating them.
    * **hail**  - Hail is like chunks of ice that fall down from the clouds as rain does.

Then **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]] sent darkness that lasted for three days**. It was so dark that the **[[:en:key-terms/egypt|Egyptians]]** could not leave their houses. But there was light where the **[[:en:key-terms/israel|Israelites]]** lived.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **God sent darkness**  - God caused darkness to cover or spread over most of Egypt. In other words, God took away the light from this part of Egypt.
    * **darkness that lasted for three days**  - This darkness was darker than ordinary nighttime darkness, and it continued to be totally dark for three whole days.

Even after **these nine plagues**, **[[:en:key-terms/pharaoh|Pharaoh]]** still refused to let the **[[:en:key-terms/israel|Israelites]]** go free. **Since Pharaoh would not listen**, **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** planned to send one last plague. **This would change Pharaoh’s mind**.


//A Bible story from: Exodus 5-10//


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **these nine plagues**  - This means, “these nine disasters that God had caused.”
    * **Since Pharaoh would not listen**  - This could be translated as, “Since Pharaoh would not do what God was telling him to do” or, “Since Pharaoh refused to obey God.”

When Pharaoh heard this he still refused to **[[:en:key-terms/believe|believe]]** and **[[:en:key-terms/obey|obey]]** God.

{{:en:obs:obs-11-02.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**[[:en:key-terms/god|God]] provided**a way to **[[:en:key-terms/save|save]]** the firstborn **[[:en:key-terms/son|son]]** of anyone who **[[:en:key-terms/believe|believed]]** in him. Each family had to choose a **perfect [[:en:key-terms/lamb|lamb]]** and kill it.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **God provided**  – God is the only one who could provide the way to save the Israelites' sons from death.
    * **perfect lamb**  - That is, “a young sheep or goat that had no blemishes or defects.”

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:11-01|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:11|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:11-03|>>]]**


===== Blood on the Door [11-03] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-11-03.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** told the **[[:en:key-terms/israel|Israelites]]** to put some of the **[[:en:key-terms/lamb|lamb's]]** **[[:en:key-terms/blood|blood]]** around the door of their house, and to roast the meat and eat it quickly, along with bread that was **made without yeast**. He also told them to be ready to leave **[[:en:key-terms/egypt|Egypt]]****when they ate**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **made without yeast**  – Yeast is something that is mixed into bread dough to make bread rise as it cooks. This could be translated as, “made without something that would make it rise.” Making the bread with yeast would have taken much longer, so cooking the bread without yeast was a way to be prepared to leave Egypt quickly.
    * **when they ate**  – This means they needed to be prepared to leave before they started to eat.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:11-02|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:11|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:11-04|>>]]**


===== The Passover Meal [11-04] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-11-04.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


The **[[:en:key-terms/israel|Israelites]]** did everything just as **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** had commanded them to do. In the middle of the night, God went throughout **[[:en:key-terms/egypt|Egypt]]** killing **every firstborn son**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **every firstborn son**  - This means every firstborn son of families who had not made the blood sacrifice, that is, the Egyptians. To make this clear you may want to add, “Every Egyptian firstborn son” (since all the Israelite families had put the blood on their doorposts).

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:11-03|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:11|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:11-05|>>]]**


===== Saved by the Blood [11-05] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-11-05.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


All the houses of the **[[:en:key-terms/israel|Israelites]]** had **[[:en:key-terms/blood|blood]]** around the doors, so **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]****passed over**  those houses. Everybody inside them was safe. **They were [[:en:key-terms/save|saved]] because of the [[:en:key-terms/lamb|lamb's]] blood**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **passed over**  - This means that God passed by those houses and did not stop to kill anyone there. This phrase became the name of the Jewish festival, “Passover.”
    * **They were saved**  - God did not kill their firstborn son.
    * **because of the lamb's blood**  - This could be translated as, “because the lamb's blood was on their door.” God saw that they had killed their lamb as he had commanded, so he did not kill their son.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:11-04|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:11|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:11-06|>>]]**


===== Death of the Firstborn [11-06] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-11-06.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


But the **[[:en:key-terms/egypt|Egyptians]]****did not [[:en:key-terms/believe|believe]] [[:en:key-terms/god|God]] or obey his commands**. So God **did not pass over**  their houses. God killed every one of the Egyptians' firstborn sons.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **did not believe God or obey his commands**  – In some languages it may be more natural or clear to say, “did not believe God and so they did not obey his commands.”
    * **did not pass over**  - He did not pass by their houses. Rather he stopped at each house and killed their eldest son.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:11-05|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:11|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:11-07|>>]]**


===== Sorrow in Egypt [11-07] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-11-07.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Every **[[:en:key-terms/egypt|Egyptian]]** firstborn male died, **from the firstborn of the prisoner in jail, to the firstborn of [[:en:key-terms/pharaoh|Pharaoh]]**. Many people in **[[:en:key-terms/egypt|Egypt]]** were crying and wailing because of their deep sadness.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **from the firstborn of the prisoner in jail, to the firstborn of Pharaoh**  - This is a way of saying that everyone's firstborn son died–from the son of the least important person to the son of the most important person, and everyone in between.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:11-06|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:11|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:11-08|>>]]**


===== Go Away! [11-08] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-11-08.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


That same night, **[[:en:key-terms/pharaoh|Pharaoh]] called for [[:en:key-terms/moses|Moses]]** and **[[:en:key-terms/aaron|Aaron]] and said**, “Take the **[[:en:key-terms/israel|Israelites]]** and leave **[[:en:key-terms/egypt|Egypt]]** immediately!” The **[[:en:key-terms/egypt|Egyptian]]** people also urged the Israelites to leave immediately.


//A Bible story from: Exodus 11:1-12:32//


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **called for**  – This means that Pharaoh told his servants to tell Moses and Aaron to come to him.
    * **and said**  – Pharaoh said the following words to Moses and Aaron after they came to him. In some languages this would be translated as, “and said to them,” or, “After they came, Pharaoh said to them.”
    * //A Bible story from//  - These references may be slightly different in some Bible translations.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:11-07|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:11|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:12-01|>>]]**


===== Israel Left Egypt [12-01] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-12-01.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


The **[[:en:key-terms/israel|Israelites]]** were very happy to leave **[[:en:key-terms/egypt|Egypt]]**. **They were no longer [[:en:key-terms/servant|slaves]]**, and they were **going**  to the **[[:en:key-terms/promised-land|Promised Land]]**! The **[[:en:key-terms/egypt|Egyptians]]** gave the Israelites whatever they asked for, even gold and silver and other valuable things. Some people from other nations **[[:en:key-terms/believe|believed]]** in **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** and went along with the Israelites as they left Egypt.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **They were no longer slaves**  - This could be translated as, “They were not slaves anymore.”
    * **going**  – Some languages may use a more specific word like “traveling” since they would be going a long distance to the Promised Land.
    * **Promised Land**  - This is the land that God had promised that he would give to Abraham's descendants.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:11-08|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:12|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:12-02|>>]]**


===== God Went before Israel [12-02] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-12-02.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** led them with a **tall pillar of cloud**  that went ahead of them during the day, and which became a **tall pillar of fire**  at night. God was always with them and **guided them**  as they traveled. All they had to do was follow him.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **tall pillar of cloud**  - This could be translated as, “a tall cloud” or, “a cloud shaped like a pillar.”
    * **tall pillar of fire**  - This was a column of fire that hung or floated in the air in front of the Israelites.
    * **guided them**  - God showed them the way by making the pillar move along in front of them so they could follow it.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:12-01|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:12|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:12-03|>>]]**


===== Pharaoh Changed His Mind [12-03] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-12-03.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**After a short time**, **[[:en:key-terms/pharaoh|Pharaoh]]** and his people **changed their minds**  and wanted the **[[:en:key-terms/israel|Israelites]]** to be their **[[:en:key-terms/servant|slaves]]** again. **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** caused Pharaoh to be stubborn so that people would see he is the One True God, and understand that he, Yahweh, is more powerful than Pharaoh and his **[[:en:key-terms/god-false|gods]]**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **After a short time**  – Probably at least two days had gone by. For that to be clear, it may be translated as, “After a few days” or, “A few days after the Israelites left Egypt.”
    * **changed their minds**  - This phrase means, “began to think differently than they had before.” Some languages may not have this same expression, and will express the meaning in a direct way.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:12-02|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:12|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:12-04|>>]]**


===== Pharaoh Chased Israel [12-04] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-12-04.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


So **[[:en:key-terms/pharaoh|Pharaoh]]** and his army chased after the **[[:en:key-terms/israel|Israelites]]** to **make them their [[:en:key-terms/servant|slaves]] again**. When the Israelites saw the **[[:en:key-terms/egypt|Egyptian]]** army coming, they realized **they were trapped between Pharaoh's army and the [[:en:key-terms/red-sea|Red Sea]]**. They were very afraid and cried out, “**Why did we leave [[:en:key-terms/egypt|Egypt]]**? We are going to die!”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **they were trapped between…Red Sea**  - Another way to say this would be, “there was nowhere they could go to escape since the Egyptians were behind them and the Red Sea was in front of them.”
    * **Why did we leave Egypt?**  – This means, “We should not have left Egypt!” They were not really asking for reasons. Because they were afraid, in this moment they were wishing they had not left Egypt (even though it had been very difficult for them there).

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:12-03|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:12|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:12-05|>>]]**


===== God Will Fight for You [12-05] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-12-05.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**[[:en:key-terms/moses|Moses]]** told the **[[:en:key-terms/israel|Israelites]]**, “**Stop being afraid**! **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]] will fight for you today and [[:en:key-terms/save|save]] you**.” Then God told Moses, “Tell the people to **move**  toward the **[[:en:key-terms/red-sea|Red Sea]]**.”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **God will fight for you today and save you**  - Another way to say this would be, “Today God will defeat the Egyptians for you and keep them from harming you.”
    * **move**  – Some languages will be more specific and say, “walk.”

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:12-04|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:12|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:12-06|>>]]**


===== Darkness over the Egyptians [12-06] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-12-06.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Then **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** moved the **pillar of cloud**  and placed it between the **[[:en:key-terms/israel|Israelites]]** and the **[[:en:key-terms/egypt|Egyptians]]** so the Egyptians **could not see**  the Israelites.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **pillar of cloud**  – See how you translated this phrase in **[[:en:obs:notes:frames:12-02|[12-02]]]**
    * **could not see**  - The cloud pillar was so large and thick that the Egyptians could no longer see any of the Israelites.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:12-05|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:12|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:12-07|>>]]**


===== Moses Divided the Sea [12-07] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-12-07.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** told **[[:en:key-terms/moses|Moses]]** to **raise his hand over the sea**  and divide the waters. Then God caused wind to push the water in the sea to the left and the right, so that a path formed through the sea.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **raise his hand over the sea**  - This could be translated as, “held out his hand over the sea”. This was a gesture to show that God was doing this miracle through Moses.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:12-06|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:12|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:12-08|>>]]**


===== Israel Crossed the Sea [12-08] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-12-08.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


The **[[:en:key-terms/israel|Israelites]]****marched**  through the sea on dry ground **with a wall of water on either side of them**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **marched**  - This can be translated as, “walked” or, “went.”
    * **with a wall of water on either side of them**  - This could be translated as, “and the water on both sides of them stood up tall and straight like a wall.”

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:12-07|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:12|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:12-09|>>]]**


===== Egypt Pursued Israel [12-09] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-12-09.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Then **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** moved the cloud up and out of the way so that the **[[:en:key-terms/egypt|Egyptians]]** could see the **[[:en:key-terms/israel|Israelites]]** escaping. The Egyptians decided to chase after them.

===== God Fought for Israel [12-10] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-12-10.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


So they followed the **[[:en:key-terms/israel|Israelites]]** onto the **path through the sea**, but **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** caused the **[[:en:key-terms/egypt|Egyptians]]****to panic**  and caused their **[[:en:key-terms/chariot|chariots]]** to **get stuck**. They shouted, “Run away! God is fighting for the Israelites!”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **path through the sea**  - This was the dry strip of land across the bottom of the sea, with a wall of water on each side.
    * **to panic**  – This could be translated as, “to get fearful and confused.”
    * **get stuck**  - The chariots could no longer move.

===== The Egyptians Drowned [12-11] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-12-11.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


After the **[[:en:key-terms/israel|Israelites]]** all **made it safely to the other side**  of the sea, **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** told **[[:en:key-terms/moses|Moses]]** to **stretch out his arm again**. When he obeyed, the **water fell on the [[:en:key-terms/egypt|Egyptian]] army**and **returned to its normal place**. **The whole Egyptian army**  drowned.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **made it safely to the other side**  – This could be translated as, “walked safely to the other side” or, “arrived safely on the other side” or, “walked to the other side and were safe from the Egyptians and the sea.”
    * **stretch out his arm again**  - This could be translated as, “lift his arm over the sea again” or, as a direct command, as in, “God told Moses, 'Stretch out your arm again.'”
    * **returned to its normal place**  - This could be translated as, “covered the place again where the path had been,” or “filled the whole sea again” or, “went back to where it was before God separated it.”
    * **The whole Egyptian army**  - This could be translated as, “everyone in Egypt's army.”

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:12-10|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:12|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:12-12|>>]]**


===== Israel Believed God [12-12] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-12-12.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


When the **[[:en:key-terms/israel|Israelites]]** saw that the **[[:en:key-terms/egypt|Egyptians]]** were dead, they **trusted in [[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** and **[[:en:key-terms/believe|believed]]** that **[[:en:key-terms/moses|Moses]]** was **a [[:en:key-terms/prophet|prophet]] of God**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **trusted in God**  - In other words, the people now trusted that God was powerful and could protect them.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:12-11|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:12|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:12-13|>>]]**


===== Israel Rejoiced [12-13] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-12-13.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


The **[[:en:key-terms/israel|Israelites]]** also **rejoiced with much excitement**  because **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** had **[[:en:key-terms/save|saved]]** them **from death and [[:en:key-terms/servant|slavery]]**! Now they were **free to serve**  God. The Israelites sang many songs to celebrate their new freedom and to **[[:en:key-terms/praise|praise]] God**because he saved them from the **[[:en:key-terms/egypt|Egyptian]]** army.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **rejoiced with much excitement**  - This could be translated as, “were very happy and they showed it enthusiastically” or, “showed it with their whole hearts” or, “with all their strength.”
    * **from death and slavery**  - This could be translated as, “from being killed or made slaves by the Egyptians.”
    * **free to serve**  - God freed, or rescued, the Israelites from being slaves in Egypt so that they could serve him.
    * **praise God**  - In some languages this could be translated as, “lift up God's name” or, “say that God is great.”

===== An Annual Feast [12-14] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-12-14.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** commanded the **[[:en:key-terms/israel|Israelites]]** to celebrate **the [[:en:key-terms/passover|Passover]]** every year in order to **remember how God gave them victory over**  the **[[:en:key-terms/egypt|Egyptians]]** and rescued them from being **[[:en:key-terms/servant|slaves]]**. They celebrated by killing a **perfect [[:en:key-terms/lamb|lamb]]**, eating it with **unleavened bread**.


//A Bible story from: Exodus 12:33-15:21//


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **the Passover**  - This could be translated as, “the Passover activities” or, “the Passover celebration” or, “the Passover meal.”
    * **remember how God gave them victory over**  – This could be translated as, “regularly remind themselves of how God defeated.” The word “remember” here doesn't just mean to not forget; it also means to formally commemorate something.
    * **perfect lamb**  - The word “perfect” here refers to a lamb with no disease or anything else wrong with it. Another way to say this might be, “a completely healthy and well-formed lamb.”
    * **unleavened bread**  - This is another way to say, “bread that was made without yeast.”
    * //A Bible story from//  - These references may be slightly different in some Bible translations.

===== The Mountain at Sinai [13-01] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-13-01.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


After **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** led the **[[:en:key-terms/israel|Israelites]]** through the **[[:en:key-terms/red-sea|Red Sea]]**, he led them through the wilderness to a mountain called **[[:en:key-terms/sinai|Sinai]]**. This was the same mountain where **[[:en:key-terms/moses|Moses]]** had seen the **burning bush**. The people **set up their tents**  at the **base of the mountain**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **burning bush**  - Before Moses returned to Egypt, God had spoken to him from a shrub that was on fire, but that was not burned up by the fire. See **[[:en:obs:notes:frames:09-12|[09-12]]]**.
    * **set up their tents**  - The Israelites had to travel a great distance from Egypt to the Promised Land. So they took tents with them so that they could set them up as shelters and sleep in them along the way. Some languages could translate this as, “hung their tents.”
    * **base of the mountain**  – This could be translated as, “bottom of the mountain.” This refers to the area of land that is located next to the place where the ground starts to slant upward to form a mountain.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:12-14|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:13|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:13-02|>>]]**


===== God Called Israel [13-02] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-13-02.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** said to **[[:en:key-terms/moses|Moses]]** and the people of **[[:en:key-terms/israel|Israel]]**, “If you will **[[:en:key-terms/obey|obey]]** me and **keep my [[:en:key-terms/covenant|covenant]]**, **you will be my prized possession**, a **[[:en:key-terms/kingdom|kingdom]] of [[:en:key-terms/priest|priests]]**, and a **[[:en:key-terms/holy|holy]] nation**.”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **keep my covenant**  - This could be translated as, “do what my covenant requires you to do.” Obeying and keeping the covenant are not two different things. One way to make this clear would be to say, “obey me by keeping my covenant.” God will soon tell them what his covenant requires.
    * **my prized possession**  - This could be translated as, “You will be my possession that I value most” or, “You will be the people that I treasure more than any other group of people” or, “You will be my own precious people.”
    * **You will be…a kingdom of priests**  - This could be translated as, “I will be your king and you will be like priests.” The Israelites were supposed to teach the other nations about God and be a mediator between God and the nations just as there were priests in the nation of Israel to go between God and the Israelites.

===== Moses Met God [13-03] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-13-03.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**Three days later**, after the people had **prepared themselves spiritually**, **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** came down on top of **[[:en:key-terms/sinai|Mount Sinai]]** with thunder, lightning, smoke, and a **loud trumpet blast**. **Only [[:en:key-terms/moses|Moses]] was allowed to go up**the mountain.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **Three days later**  - In other words, three days after they arrived at Mount Sinai and God first spoke to them.
    * **prepared themselves spiritually**  - This refers to ceremonial cleansing in preparation to meet with God. This could be translated as, “got ready to meet with God” or, “prepared themselves to meet with God.”
    * **loud trumpet blast**  - This could be translated as, “and a loud sound came from a horn” or, “and a horn was blown and it made a loud sound” or, “and they heard the loud sound of a horn blowing.” Trumpets were made out of ram's horns. They were used that day to call the people to gather at the mountain and meet with God.
    * **Only Moses was allowed to go up**  - This could be translated as, “God permitted Moses to go up, but he did not permit anyone else to go up.”

{{:en:obs:obs-13-04.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**Then [[:en:key-terms/god|God]] gave them the [[:en:key-terms/covenant|covenant]] and said**, “I am **[[:en:key-terms/yahweh|Yahweh]], your God**, **who [[:en:key-terms/save|saved]] you from [[:en:key-terms/servant|slavery]]** in **[[:en:key-terms/egypt|Egypt]]**. Do not **[[:en:key-terms/worship|worship]]** other **[[:en:key-terms/god-false|gods]]**.”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **Then God gave them the covenant and said**  - What God says next is the content of the covenant, that is, he tells the people the things that they must obey. This could be translated as, “Then God told them His covenant. He said” or, “Then God made this covenant with them:”
    * **Yahweh your God**  - In some languages it might be more natural to change the order and say “your God Yahweh.” Make sure it does not sound like the Israelites had more than one God. It should be clear that Yahweh is the only God. Another way to translate this would be, “Yahweh, who is your God” or, “your God, whose name is Yahweh.”
    * **who saved you from slavery**  - This could be translated as, “I freed you from slavery.”

{{:en:obs:obs-13-05.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


“Do not make **[[:en:key-terms/idol|idols]]** and do not **[[:en:key-terms/worship|worship]]** them, because **I, [[:en:key-terms/yahweh|Yahweh]], am a jealous [[:en:key-terms/god|God]]**. **Do not use my name in a disrespectful way**. Be sure to keep the **[[:en:key-terms/sabbath|Sabbath day]]** **[[:en:key-terms/holy|holy]]**. That is, do all your work in six days, for the **[[:en:key-terms/sabbath|seventh day]]** is a day for you to rest and **to remember me**.”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * (God continues speaking to Moses.)


    * **I, Yahweh, am a jealous God**  - This could be translated as, “I, Yahweh, will be angry if you worship or honor anything besides me.” God strongly desires that his people love, serve, and obey Him more than anything or anyone else. He must be the only master of their lives.
    * **Do not use my name in a disrespectful way**  - This could be translated as, “Do not talk about me in a way that does not show respect and honor” or, “Talk about me in a way that gives me proper respect and honor.”
    * **seventh day**  - To translate this, it is best to use the number (“seventh”) rather than give the name of a specific day of the week.
    * **to remember me**  - This could be translated as, “to keep me in mind” or, “to honor me.”

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:13-04|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:13|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:13-06|>>]]**


===== More Commandments [13-06] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-13-06.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


“**Honor**  your father and your mother. Do not murder. **Do not commit [[:en:key-terms/adultery|adultery]]**. **Do not steal**. **Do not lie**. Do not desire to have your neighbor’s wife, his house, or anything that belongs to him.”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * (God continues speaking to Moses.)


    * **Do not commit adultery**  - This could be translated as, “Do not have sexual relations with someone else's spouse” or, “Do not have marital relations with another man's wife or another woman's husband.” Be sure to translate this in a way that doesn't offend or embarrass people. Languages often have an indirect, polite way of saying this, such as, “Do not sleep with.”
    * **Do not lie**  - This means, “Do not say false things about other people.”

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:13-05|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:13|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:13-07|>>]]**


===== The Stone Tablets [13-07] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-13-07.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Then **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** wrote **these [[:en:key-terms/ten-commandments|Ten Commandments]]** on two **stone tablets**  and gave them to **[[:en:key-terms/moses|Moses]]**. **God also gave**  many other **[[:en:key-terms/gods-law|laws]]** and rules **to follow**. If the people **[[:en:key-terms/obey|obeyed]]** these laws, God **[[:en:key-terms/promise|promised]]** that he would **[[:en:key-terms/bless|bless]]** and protect them. If they **[[:en:key-terms/disobey|disobeyed]]** them, God would **[[:en:key-terms/punish|punish]] them**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **these Ten Commandments**  - This refers to the commands God gave to Moses for the Israelites to obey. They are listed in frames **[[:en:obs:notes:frames:13-05|[13-05]]]** and **[[:en:obs:notes:frames:13-06|[13-06]]]**.
    * **stone tablets**  - These were flat pieces of stone.
    * **God also gave**  - This can be translated as, “God also told them.”
    * **to follow**  - This can be translated as, “that they must obey” or, “that they must keep.”

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:13-06|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:13|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:13-08|>>]]**


===== The Tent of Meeting [13-08] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-13-08.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** also gave the **[[:en:key-terms/israel|Israelites]] a detailed description**of a tent he wanted them to make. **It was called**  the **[[:en:key-terms/tent-of-meeting|Tent of Meeting]]**, and it had two rooms, separated by a large curtain. Only the **[[:en:key-terms/priest-high|high priest]]** was allowed to go into **the room behind the curtain**, because **God lived there**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **a detailed description**  - This could be translated as, “God described it in detail” or, “God told them exactly how He wanted them to make it.”
    * **It was called**  - This could be translated as, “They called it” or, “Moses called it.”
    * **the room behind the curtain**  - This room was hidden by the curtain. Some languages would call this room, “the room in front of the curtain.”
    * **God lived there**  - If this phrase would lead people to think that God was limited to living in the tent, here are some ways of translating it: “God was there” or, “God revealed Himself to humans there.”

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:13-07|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:13|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:13-09|>>]]**


===== The Altar [13-09] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-13-09.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Anyone who **[[:en:key-terms/disobey|disobeyed]]** **[[:en:key-terms/gods-law|God's law]]** could bring an animal **to the altar in front of the [[:en:key-terms/tent-of-meeting|Tent of Meeting]]** as a **[[:en:key-terms/sacrifice|sacrifice]]** to **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]**. A **[[:en:key-terms/priest|priest]]** would kill the animal and burn it on the **[[:en:key-terms/altar|altar]]**. **The [[:en:key-terms/blood|blood]] of the animal that was sacrificed covered the person’s [[:en:key-terms/sin|sin]]** and made that person **clean in God's sight**. God chose **[[:en:key-terms/moses|Moses']]** brother, **[[:en:key-terms/aaron|Aaron]]**, and Aaron's **[[:en:key-terms/descendant|descendants]]** to be his priests.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **God's law**  - This refers to all the commandments and instructions that God had told the Israelites to obey.
    * **to the Tent of Meeting**  - They did not bring the animal inside the Tent of Meeting, but to the altar in front of the Tent of Meeting. Be sure not to use an expression that means that they brought it inside.
    * **covered the person’s sin**  - When people brought animals to sacrifice, God chose to see the blood of the animals as a covering over their sin. This is like hiding something that is ugly or dirty by covering it.
    * **clean in God's sight**  - This could be translated as, “as if he did not have the sin according to God” or, “free of the punishment for breaking God's law.”

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:13-08|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:13|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:13-10|>>]]**


===== The People Sinned [13-10] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-13-10.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


The people all agreed to **[[:en:key-terms/obey|obey]]** the laws that **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** had **given them**, to **[[:en:key-terms/worship|worship]]** only God, and to be **his special people**. But a short time after they **[[:en:key-terms/promise|promised]]** to obey God, they **[[:en:key-terms/sin|sinned]] terribly**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **given them**  - This could be translated as, “told them to obey.”
    * **his special people**  - From among all the nations, God had chosen the Israelites for his special purpose. This could be translated as “his special nation” or, “his own people” or, “the nation he chose to be his people.”
    * **a short time**  – The people sinned during the forty days that Moses was on the mountain with God.
    * **sinned terribly**  - They sinned in a way that was especially offensive to God. This could be translated as, “they sinned badly,” or “they did something that was very bad” or, “they did something bad that made God very angry.”

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:13-09|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:13|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:13-11|>>]]**


===== Make Us an Idol for Us [13-11] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-13-11.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


For many days, **[[:en:key-terms/moses|Moses]]** was on top of **[[:en:key-terms/sinai|Mount Sinai]]** talking with **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]**. **The people became tired of waiting**  for him to return. So they **brought gold**  to **[[:en:key-terms/aaron|Aaron]]** and asked him to make an **[[:en:key-terms/idol|idol]]** for them!


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **The people became tired of waiting**  - This could be translated as, “The people became impatient because he did not return quickly” or, “The people didn't want to wait any longer for him to return.”
    * **brought gold**  - These were objects and jewelry made of gold, which could be melted and formed into other things.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:13-10|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:13|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:13-12|>>]]**


===== The Golden Calf [13-12] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-13-12.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**[[:en:key-terms/aaron|Aaron]] made a golden [[:en:key-terms/idol|idol]]** in the shape of a calf. The people began to **wildly [[:en:key-terms/worship|worship]]** the idol and make **[[:en:key-terms/sacrifice|sacrifices]]** to it! **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** was very angry with them because of their **[[:en:key-terms/sin|sin]]** and planned to destroy them. But **[[:en:key-terms/moses|Moses]]** **[[:en:key-terms/pray|prayed]]** for them, and God **listened to his prayer**  and did not destroy them.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **made a golden idol**  - Aaron took the things made of gold that the people had brought to him, melted them, combined them, and formed them into the shape of a calf.
    * **wildly worship**  - The people were sinning by worshiping the idol and also by doing sinful things as they worshiped it.
    * **listened to his prayer**  - God always hears prayer. In this situation, “listened” means that God agreed to do what Moses asked.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:13-11|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:13|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:13-13|>>]]**


===== Moses Was Angry [13-13] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-13-13.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


When **[[:en:key-terms/moses|Moses]]** came down the mountain and saw the **[[:en:key-terms/idol|idol]]**, he was so angry that he **smashed the stones**  on which **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** had written the **[[:en:key-terms/ten-commandments|Ten Commandments]]**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **smashed the stones**  - He threw the stones down on the ground and they broke up into little pieces.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:13-12|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:13|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:13-14|>>]]**


===== Moses Destroyed the Idol [13-14] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-13-14.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Then **[[:en:key-terms/moses|Moses]] beat the [[:en:key-terms/idol|idol]] into powder**, threw the powder into some water and made the people drink the water. **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** sent **a plague**  on the people and many of them died.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **beat the idol into powder**  - Moses utterly destroyed the idol by pounding it into fine particles.
    * **into some water**  - Moses scattered the gold powder over a large expanse of water.
    * **a plague**  - This could be translated as, “a terrible disease.”

===== Moses Prayed for Israel [13-15] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-13-15.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**[[:en:key-terms/moses|Moses]]** climbed the mountain again and **[[:en:key-terms/pray|prayed]]** that **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** would **[[:en:key-terms/forgive|forgive]]** the people. God **listened to**  Moses and forgave them. **Moses wrote**  the **[[:en:key-terms/ten-commandments|Ten Commandments]]** on new stone tablets to replace the ones he had broken. Then God led the **[[:en:key-terms/israel|Israelites]]** away from **[[:en:key-terms/sinai|Mount Sinai]]** toward the **[[:en:key-terms/promised-land|Promised Land]]**.


//A Bible story from: Exodus 19-34//


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **listened to**  - See how you translated this phrase in **[[:en:obs:notes:frames:13-12|[13-12]]]**.
    * **Moses wrote**  - Moses chiseled the words into the stone using a tool.
    * //A Bible story from//  - These references may be slightly different in some Bible translations.

===== God Led Israel [14-01] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-14-01.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


After **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** had told the **[[:en:key-terms/israel|Israelites]]** the laws he wanted them to obey as part of his **[[:en:key-terms/covenant|covenant]]** with them, they left **[[:en:key-terms/sinai|Mount Sinai]]**. God began leading them from toward the **[[:en:key-terms/promised-land|Promised Land]]**, which was also called **[[:en:key-terms/canaan|Canaan]]**. The **pillar of cloud**  went ahead of them towards Canaan and they followed it.


==== Translation Notes: ====

{{:en:obs:obs-14-02.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** had **[[:en:key-terms/promise|promised]]** **[[:en:key-terms/abraham|Abraham]]**, **[[:en:key-terms/isaac|Isaac]]**, and **[[:en:key-terms/jacob|Jacob]]** that he would give the **[[:en:key-terms/promised-land|Promised Land]]** to their **[[:en:key-terms/descendant|descendants]]**, but now there were many **[[:en:key-terms/people-group|people groups]]** living there. They were called **[[:en:key-terms/canaan|Canaanites]]**. The Canaanites did not **[[:en:key-terms/worship|worship]]** or **[[:en:key-terms/obey|obey]]** God. They worshiped **[[:en:key-terms/god-false|false gods]]** and did many **[[:en:key-terms/evil|evil]]** things.

===== Destroy the Canaanites [14-03] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-14-03.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** told the **[[:en:key-terms/israel|Israelites]]**, “You must **get rid of**  all the **[[:en:key-terms/canaan|Canaanites]]** in the **[[:en:key-terms/promised-land|Promised Land]]**. **Do not make [[:en:key-terms/peace|peace]] with them**and **do not marry them**. You must completely destroy all of their **[[:en:key-terms/idol|idols]]**. If you do not **[[:en:key-terms/obey|obey]]** me, **you will [[:en:key-terms/worship|worship]] their idols**instead of me.”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **get rid of**  - This could be translated as, “get them out of the land” or, “remove them from the land.”
    * **Do not make peace with them**  - This could be translated as, “Do not live peacefully among or alongside them” or, “Do not promise to live peacefully with them.”
    * **do not marry them**  - God did not want any Israelite person to marry any Canaanite person.
    * **you will worship their idols**  - If the Israelites became friends with the Canaanites and did not destroy the idols, they would be tempted to worship those idols instead of God. You could say, “you will end up worshiping” to make it clear that this would result from living so close to the Canaanites and learning their ways.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:14-02|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:14|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:14-04|>>]]**


===== The Twelve Spies [14-04] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-14-04.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


When the **[[:en:key-terms/israel|Israelites]]** reached the border of **[[:en:key-terms/canaan|Canaan]]**, **[[:en:key-terms/moses|Moses]]** chose twelve men, one from each tribe of **[[:en:key-terms/israel|Israel]]**. He gave the men instructions to go and **spy on the land**  to see what it was like. They were also to **spy on the [[:en:key-terms/canaan|Canaanites]] to see if they were strong or weak**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **spy on the land**  - This could be translated as, “secretly get information about the land” or, “secretly learn about the land.” Part of the spies' task was to find out what kinds of food the land could produce.
    * **spy on the Canaanites**  - This could be translated as, “secretly get information about the people of Canaan” or, “secretly learn about the Canaanites.”
    * **to see if they were strong or weak**  - They wanted to know if the Canaanites were prepared to fight against them. This could be translated as, “to find out how powerful the Canaanite armies were.”

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:14-03|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:14|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:14-05|>>]]**


===== The Bad Report [14-05] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-14-05.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


The twelve men traveled through **[[:en:key-terms/canaan|Canaan]]** for forty days and then **they came back**. They told the people, “The land is very fertile and the crops are plentiful!” But ten of the spies said, “**The cities are very strong**  and **the people are giants**! If we attack them, they will certainly defeat us and kill us!”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **they came back**  - They returned to where the rest of the Israelites were waiting, just outside the border of Canaan.
    * **The cities are very strong**  - The cities had strong walls around them, so it would be very difficult for the Israelites to attack them.
    * **the people are giants**  – This could be translated as, “the people are like giants compared to us!” or, “the people are much taller and stronger than we are!”

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:14-04|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:14|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:14-06|>>]]**


===== Joshua and Caleb [14-06] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-14-06.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Immediately **[[:en:key-terms/caleb|Caleb]]** and **[[:en:key-terms/joshua|Joshua]]**, the other two spies, said, “It is true that the **people of [[:en:key-terms/canaan|Canaan]]** are tall and strong, but **we can certainly defeat them! [[:en:key-terms/god|God]] will fight for us**!”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **people of Canaan**  – This could be translated as, “the people who live in Canaan” or, “the Canaanites.”
    * **we can certainly defeat them! God will fight for us**  – To show the connection between these two statements, it may be necessary to say, “we can certainly defeat them because God will fight for us!”
    * **God will fight for us**  – This could be translated as, “God will fight alongside us and help us defeat them!” This makes it clear that the Israelites would also be fighting against the Canaanites.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:14-05|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:14|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:14-07|>>]]**


===== The People Rebelled [14-07] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-14-07.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


But the people did not listen to **[[:en:key-terms/caleb|Caleb]]** and **[[:en:key-terms/joshua|Joshua]]**. They became angry with **[[:en:key-terms/moses|Moses]]** and **[[:en:key-terms/aaron|Aaron]]** and said, “**Why did you bring us**  to **this horrible place**? We should have stayed in **[[:en:key-terms/egypt|Egypt]] rather than be killed in battle and our wives and children made [[:en:key-terms/servant|slaves]]**.” The people wanted to choose a different leader to take them back to Egypt.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **Why did you bring us**  – This is not a real question. It is a way that some languages use to say, “You should not have brought us.”
    * **this horrible place**  - They considered Canaan to be “horrible” because they thought it was so dangerous that they would all be killed.
    * **rather than be killed in battle and our wives and children made slaves**  - This could be translated as, “If we fight against the Canaanites, they will kill us men and force our wives and children to be their slaves.”

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:14-06|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:14|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:14-08|>>]]**


===== God Spoke [14-08] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-14-08.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**[[:en:key-terms/god|God]] was very angry**and **came to**  the **[[:en:key-terms/tent-of-meeting|Tent of Meeting]]**. **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** said, “Because you have rebelled against me, all of the people will have to **wander in the wilderness**. Except for **[[:en:key-terms/joshua|Joshua]]** and **[[:en:key-terms/caleb|Caleb]]**, everyone who is twenty years or older will die there and never enter the **[[:en:key-terms/promised-land|Promised Land]]**.”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **came to**  - God did not appear as a person, but came in some other form that showed his glory and power.
    * **wander in the wilderness**  - God would lead the people around in the wilderness with no specific destination until all of the adults who rebelled against him died.

===== The People Ignored God [14-09] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-14-09.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


When the people heard this, they were sorry **they had [[:en:key-terms/sin|sinned]]**. They took their weapons and went to attack the people of **[[:en:key-terms/canaan|Canaan]]**. **[[:en:key-terms/moses|Moses]] warned them not to go**because **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]] was not with them**, **but they did not listen to him**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **they had sinned**  - It may be necessary to add, “they had sinned by disobeying God's command to conquer the peoples of Canaan.”
    * **Moses warned them not to go**  - This means that Moses told them not to go to fight against the Canaanites because they would be in danger if they did that.
    * **God was not with them**  – In other words, God would not be with them to help them. Because of the Israelites' disobedience, God withdrew from them his presence, protection, and power.
    * **but they did not listen to him**  - They did not obey Moses. They went to attack the Canaanites anyway.

===== The Canaanites Defeated Israel [14-10] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-14-10.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**[[:en:key-terms/god|God]] did not go with them into this battle**, so they were defeated and many of them were killed. Then the **[[:en:key-terms/israel|Israelites]] turned back from [[:en:key-terms/canaan|Canaan]]** and **wandered through the wilderness**  for forty years.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **God did not go with them into this battle**  - In other words, God did not help them in this fight.
    * **turned back from Canaan**  - They left Canaan and went back into the wilderness where they were before.
    * **wandered through the wilderness**  - They lived in the wilderness, and together they moved from place to place in that large, dry land, looking for food and water for themselves and their animals.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:14-09|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:14|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:14-11|>>]]**


===== Manna from Heaven [14-11] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-14-11.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


During the forty years that the people of **[[:en:key-terms/israel|Israel]]** wandered in the wilderness, **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]] provided for them**. He gave them **bread from heaven, called “manna.” He also sent flocks of quail**  (which are medium-sized birds) **into their camp**  so they could have meat to eat. During all that time, God kept their clothes and shoes from wearing out.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **God provided for them**  – This could be translated as, “God gave them everything they needed for food, water, and shelter.”
    * **bread from heaven, called “manna”**  - This thin, bread-like food fell from the sky overnight onto the grass like dew. They called it “manna.” Almost every day the people gathered this “manna” and cooked it as their food.
    * **He also sent flocks of quail…camp**  - Another way to say this would be, “He also caused a large number of quails to fly into their camp.” If quails are unknown, a different, similar type bird could be used. Or it could be translated as, “a large number of medium-sized birds.”
    * **their camp**  - The place where the Israelites set up their tents to sleep in was called a “camp.” It was like a city with tents instead of buildings, and it could be moved around.

===== Water from a Rock [14-12] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-14-12.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** even **miraculously gave them water from a rock**. **But despite all this**, the people of **[[:en:key-terms/israel|Israel]]** complained and grumbled against God and against **[[:en:key-terms/moses|Moses]]**. **Even so, God was still [[:en:key-terms/faithful|faithful]] to his [[:en:key-terms/promise|promises]]** to **[[:en:key-terms/abraham|Abraham]]**, **[[:en:key-terms/isaac|Isaac]]**, and **[[:en:key-terms/jacob|Jacob]]**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **miraculously gave them water from a rock**  - This could be translated, “by doing something that only God can do, he made water pour out of a rock so the people and animals could drink.”
    * **But despite all this**  - This could be translated as, “But even though God provided food, water, clothing, and everything that they needed.”
    * **Even so**  - This could be translated, “Even though the Israelites complained and grumbled against him.”
    * **God was still faithful to his promises**  - This could be translated, “God continued to do what he had told Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob he would do.” He provided their descendants with what they needed so they that could live and become a great nation and eventually own the land of Canaan.

===== Moses Struck the Rock [14-13] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-14-13.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Another time when the people did not have any water, **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** told **[[:en:key-terms/moses|Moses]]**, “Speak to the rock, and water will come out of it.” But **Moses dishonored God**  in front of all the people **by hitting the rock twice with a stick instead of speaking to it**. Water came out of the rock for everyone to drink, but God was angry with Moses and said, “You will not enter the **[[:en:key-terms/promised-land|Promised Land]]**.”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **Moses dishonored God**  - This could be translated, “Moses disobeyed God” or, “Moses disrespected God.” God had a specific way He wanted Moses to show the people God's power to provide for them. When Moses disobeyed God by doing it in a different way he showed a lack of respect for God.
    * **by hitting the rock twice with a stick instead of speaking to it**  - This can be translated as, “Moses did not speak to the rock; he hit it twice with a stick.”

After the **[[:en:key-terms/israel|Israelites]]** had wandered in the wilderness for forty years, all of them **who had [[:en:key-terms/rebel|rebelled]] against [[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** were dead. Then God led **the people**  to the edge of the **[[:en:key-terms/promised-land|Promised Land]]** again. **[[:en:key-terms/moses|Moses]]** was now very old, so God chose **[[:en:key-terms/joshua|Joshua]]** to help him lead the people. God also **[[:en:key-terms/promise|promised]]** Moses that **one day**, he would send **another [[:en:key-terms/prophet|prophet]] like Moses**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **who had rebelled against God**  - This could be translated, “who had refused to obey God when he told them to go into the Promised Land.”
    * **the people**  - That is, the children of the generation that died.
    * **one day**  - This means, “some time in the future.”
    * **another prophet like Moses**  - Like Moses, this man would be an Israelite, he would speak God's words to the people, and he would lead the people.

Then **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** told **[[:en:key-terms/moses|Moses]]** to go to the top of a mountain so he could see the **[[:en:key-terms/promised-land|Promised Land]]**. Moses saw the Promised Land but God did not permit him to enter it. Then Moses died, and the **[[:en:key-terms/israel|Israelites]] mourned for thirty days**. **[[:en:key-terms/joshua|Joshua]]** became their new leader. Joshua was a good leader because he **[[:en:key-terms/trust|trusted]]** and **[[:en:key-terms/obey|obeyed]]** God.


//A Bible story from: Exodus 16-17; Numbers 10-14; 20; 27; Deuteronomy 34//


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **mourned for thirty days**  - For thirty days all the people of Israel cried and showed that they were very sad that Moses had died.
    * //A Bible story from//  - These references may be slightly different in some Bible translations.

**At last it was time for**  the **[[:en:key-terms/israel|Israelites]]** to **enter [[:en:key-terms/canaan|Canaan]]**, the **[[:en:key-terms/promised-land|Promised Land]]**. **[[:en:key-terms/joshua|Joshua]]** sent **two spies to the [[:en:key-terms/canaan|Canaanite]] city of [[:en:key-terms/jericho|Jericho]]** that was **protected by strong walls**. In that city there lived a prostitute named **[[:en:key-terms/rahab|Rahab]]** who hid the spies and later helped them to **escape**. She did this because she **[[:en:key-terms/believe|believed]]** **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]**. They **[[:en:key-terms/promise|promised]]** to protect Rahab and **her family**  when the Israelites would destroy Jericho.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **At last it was time for**  - “At last” means “finally” or, “after a long wait.” To make it clear what “time” refers to, you could say, “after they had wandered in the desert for 40 years, God finally permitted.”
    * **two spies to the Canaanite city of Jericho**  - This could be translated as, “two men to Jericho, a city in Canaan, to find out information about it.” Also see the notes for, “spy out the land” in **[[:en:obs:notes:frames:14-04|[14-04]]]**.
    * **protected by strong walls**  - This could be translated as, “completely surrounded by thick, strong walls made of stone to protect it from their enemies.”
    * **escape**  – It is also possible to add, “escape from people in Jericho who wanted to harm them.”
    * **her family**  - Rahab asked for protection for her father, mother, brothers, and sisters. Use your word for family that includes these people.

==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **Have the priests go first**  – For some languages it may be helpful to add, “Have the priests go before the rest of the people to cross the river.”
    * **the water upstream stopped flowing**  — In some languages it may be helpful to add, “and the water in front of them flowed away downstream.”

The people **[[:en:key-terms/obey|obeyed]]** God. Just as God told them to do, the soldiers and **[[:en:key-terms/priest|priests]]** marched around the city of Jericho **once a day for six days**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **After the people crossed the Jordan River**  – In some languages it is better to say, “The people crossed the Jordan River and then…”
    * **how to attack**  – This could be translated as, “exactly what he should do to attack.”
    * **once a day for six days**  - That is, they went around the city one time every day for a total of six days.

    * **blew their trumpets**  - This could be translated as, “They sounded their trumpets” or, “They played their trumpets.” These trumpets were made out of ram's horns.

Then the walls around **[[:en:key-terms/jericho|Jericho]]** fell down! The **[[:en:key-terms/israel|Israelites]]** destroyed everything in the city as **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** had commanded. They only spared **[[:en:key-terms/rahab|Rahab]]** and her family, who **became part of**  the Israelites. When the other people living in **[[:en:key-terms/canaan|Canaan]]** heard that the Israelites had destroyed Jericho, they were terrified that the Israelites would attack them also.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **became part of**  - This can be translated as, “who then joined the Israelite community” or, “who then became members of the nation of Israel.”

They asked Joshua to make a peace treaty with them. Joshua and the Israelites did not ask God **where the Gibeonites were from**. So Joshua made a peace treaty with them.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **peace treaty**  – This is an agreement between two groups of people that they will not harm each other but will live in peace and help each other. This could be translated as, “peace agreement.”
    * **But one of the Canaanite people groups called the Gibeonites**  – Some languages may introduce this as, “But one day a Canaanite people group by the name of the Gibeonites …”
    * **lied to Joshua and said**  - This could be translated as, “They lied to Joshua by saying” or, “They falsely said to Joshua” or, “They falsely told Joshua.”
    * **where the Gibeonites were from**  - That is, “where the Gibeonites lived” or, “where the Gibeonites' home was.” “Gibeonites” means, “people of Gibeon.”

The **[[:en:key-terms/israel|Israelites]]** were angry when they found out that the **[[:en:key-terms/gibeon|Gibeonites]]** had deceived them, but they kept the **[[:en:key-terms/peace|peace]]** treaty they had made with them because it was a **[[:en:key-terms/promise|promise]]** before **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]**. Sometime later, the **[[:en:key-terms/king|kings]]** of another people group in **[[:en:key-terms/canaan|Canaan]]**, the **[[:en:key-terms/amorite|Amorites]]**, heard that the Gibeonites had made a peace treaty with the Israelites, so they combined their armies into one large army and attacked **[[:en:key-terms/gibeon|Gibeon]]**. The Gibeonites **sent a message to [[:en:key-terms/joshua|Joshua]] asking for help**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **sent a message to Joshua asking for help**  - This could be translated as, “sent some of their people to tell Joshua that they needed the Israelites to help defend them against their enemies.”

==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **to reach the Gibeonites**  - That is, “to get to the Gibeonites” or, “to arrive at where the Gibeonites lived.” The Gibeonites lived in Canaan, but Canaan is big enough that it took all night for the Israelite army to travel from their camp to where the Gibeonites were.
    * **they surprised the Amorite armies**  - The Amorites did not know that the Israelites were coming to attack them.

==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **God fought for Israel**  - God fought on the side of Israel against Israel's enemies.
    * **caused the Amorites to be confused**  - This could be translated as, “made the Amorites panic” or, “caused the Amorites to be unable to fight together well.”

==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **God gave…Land**  – this could be translated as, “God appointed each tribe its own plot of land” or, “God decided which part of the Promised Land each tribe of Israel would live on.”

The people **[[:en:key-terms/promise|promised]]** to **remain [[:en:key-terms/faithful|faithful]] to God**and **follow [[:en:key-terms/gods-law|his laws]]**.


//A Bible story from: Joshua 1-24//


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **When Joshua was an old man**  – It may be clearer to say, “Many years later, when Joshua was an old man.” Joshua was over 100 years old at this time.
    * **remain faithful to God**  - In other words, they would be loyal to God. They would worship and serve only God; they would not worship or serve any other gods.
    * **follow his laws**  - This means that the people would obey the laws that God had given them already as part of the covenant.

The Israelites began to **[[:en:key-terms/worship|worship]]** the Canaanite **[[:en:key-terms/god-false|gods]]** instead of **[[:en:key-terms/yahweh|Yahweh]]**, **the [[:en:key-terms/true|true]] God**. The Israelites had no **[[:en:key-terms/king|king]]**, so everyone did **what they thought was right for them**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **and did not drive out**  – This tells how they disobeyed God, so in some languages it may be better to start this as a new sentence, “They did not.”
    * **drive out the rest of the Canaanites**  - This can be translated, “fight with the rest of the Canaanites to force them to leave the land.”
    * **or obey God's laws**  - This means that the people also disobeyed the laws that God gave to the Israelites at Mount Sinai.
    * **the true God**  - That is, “the only real God.” Yahweh is the only one that people should worship.
    * **what they thought was right for them**  – This means that they all did whatever they wanted to do, including many evil things.

But then **the people forgot about God**  and started **[[:en:key-terms/worship|worshiping]]** **[[:en:key-terms/idol|idols]]** again. So God allowed the **[[:en:key-terms/midian|Midianites]]**, a nearby enemy people group, to defeat them.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **God provided**  - This could be translated as, “God chose” or, “God appointed” or, “God raised up.”
    * **brought peace**  - This could be translated as, “allowed the people to live without fear” or, “ended the fighting” or, “stopped their enemies from attacking them.”

**One day**, a man of Israel named **[[:en:key-terms/gideon|Gideon]]** was **threshing grain secretly**  so the **[[:en:key-terms/midian|Midianites]]** would not steal it. The **[[:en:key-terms/angel|angel]]** of **[[:en:key-terms/yahweh|Yahweh]]** came to Gideon and said, “**[[:en:key-terms/god|God]] is with you**, mighty warrior. Go and save **[[:en:key-terms/israel|Israel]]** from the Midianites.”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **One day**  - This phrase introduces an event that happened in the past, but does not state the specific time. Many languages have a similar way to begin telling a true story.
    * **threshing grain**  - The grain was wheat, which has a head of many small grains, or seeds, on the top of a thin stalk. “Threshing” is separating the seeds of the plant from the stalks by beating the heads of grain. The seeds are food, but the stalks are not.
    * **secretly**  - Gideon was threshing the grain in a hidden location, so the Midianites would not see him.
    * **God is with you**  – This means, “God is present with you in a special way” or, “God has plans to use you in a special way.”

===== Gideon Destroyed the Idol [16-06] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-16-06.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**[[:en:key-terms/gideon|Gideon's]]** father had an **[[:en:key-terms/altar|altar]]** dedicated to an **[[:en:key-terms/idol|idol]]**. **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** told Gideon **to tear down**  that altar. But Gideon was **afraid of the people**, so he **waited until nighttime**. Then he tore down the altar and smashed it to pieces. He built a new altar to God near where the altar to the idol used to be and made a **[[:en:key-terms/sacrifice|sacrifice]]** to God on it.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **to tear down**  - This means, “to violently bring down” or, “to take down and destroy.”
    * **afraid of the people**  - Gideon was afraid that his fellow Israelites who worshiped the same idol would be angry with him.
    * **waited until nighttime**  - Another way to say this would be, “waited until after dark.” Gideon smashed the altar at night when everyone was asleep so that no one would see him do it.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:16-05|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:16|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:16-07|>>]]**


===== Gideon Was Rescued [16-07] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-16-07.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


The next morning the people saw that someone had torn down and destroyed the **[[:en:key-terms/altar|altar]]**, and they were very angry. They went to **[[:en:key-terms/gideon|Gideon's]]** house to kill him, but Gideon's father said, “**Why are you trying to help your [[:en:key-terms/god-false|god]]**? **If he is a god, let him protect himself**!” Because he said this, the people did not kill Gideon.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **Why are you trying to help your god?**  - This is not a real question that asks for information. Another way of saying this would be, “You should not be trying to help your god” or, “You should not need to help your god.”
    * **If he is a god, let him protect himself**  - This means, “If he were truly a god, he would be able to defend himself.”

===== Midian Attacked Israel Again [16-08] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-16-08.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Then the **[[:en:key-terms/midian|Midianites]] came again to steal from the [[:en:key-terms/israel|Israelites]]**. There were so many of them that **they could not be counted**. **[[:en:key-terms/gideon|Gideon]]** called the Israelites together to fight them. Gideon asked **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]****for two signs**  so he could be sure **that God would use him to [[:en:key-terms/save|save]] [[:en:key-terms/israel|Israel]]**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **came again to steal from the Israelites**  – This could be translated as, “came again to the Israelites' land to steal things from them.”
    * **they could not be counted**  - This could be translated as, “The number of the Midianites was too great to count” or, “it would be very difficult to count all of the Midianites.”
    * **for two signs**  - This could be translated as, “to do two miracles” or, “to make two impossible things happen.”
    * **that God would use him**  – This could be translated as, “that God would enable him” or, “that God would help him” or, “that God was calling him.”
    * **to save Israel**  - This could be translated as, “to rescue Israel from the Midianites.”

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:16-07|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:16|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:16-09|>>]]**


===== The Wet Cloth [16-09] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-16-09.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


For the first **sign**, **[[:en:key-terms/gideon|Gideon]]** laid a cloth on the ground and asked **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** to **let the morning dew fall**  only on the cloth and not on the ground. **God did that**. The next night, he asked that the ground be wet but the cloth dry. God did that too. These two signs convinced Gideon that God would use him to **[[:en:key-terms/save|save]]** **[[:en:key-terms/israel|Israel]]** from the **[[:en:key-terms/midian|Midianites]]**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **sign**  - This could be translated as, “miracle” or, “impossible thing.”
    * **let the morning dew fall**  - This can be translated as, “make the morning dew appear” or, “make the morning dew come up.” “Dew” refers to the drops of water that appear on the ground in the morning. Dew naturally covers everything equally.
    * **God did that**  - This could be translated as, “God did what Gideon asked him to do.”

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:16-08|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:16|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:16-10|>>]]**


===== Too Many Soldiers [16-10] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-16-10.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**32,000 [[:en:key-terms/israel|Israelite]] soldiers came to [[:en:key-terms/gideon|Gideon]]**, but **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** told him this was **too many**. So Gideon sent home 22,000 who were afraid to fight. God told Gideon that he still had too many men. So Gideon sent all of them home **except for 300 soldiers**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **32,000 Israelite soldiers came to Gideon**  - Some languages might need to insert the following sentence at the beginning of the story: “Gideon called the Israelites to come fight against the Midianites.” See **[[:en:obs:notes:frames:16-08|[16-08]]]**.
    * **too many**  - This was more soldiers than God wanted for this fight. If that many solders fought and won, they would think that they won the battle with their own strength, and they would not know that God did it.
    * **except for 300 soldiers**  - This sentence could be translated as, “So Gideon allowed only 300 men to stay, and the rest of the men went home.”

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:16-09|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:16|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:16-11|>>]]**


===== The Midianite's Dream [16-11] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-16-11.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


That night **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** told **[[:en:key-terms/gideon|Gideon]]**, “**Go down**  to the **[[:en:key-terms/midian|Midianite]]** camp and when you hear what they say, you will **no longer be afraid**.” So that night, Gideon went down to the camp and heard a Midianite soldier telling his friend about **something he had [[:en:key-terms/dream|dreamed]]**. The man’s friend said, “This dream means that Gideon's army will defeat the Midianite army!” When Gideon heard this, he **[[:en:key-terms/worship|worshiped]]** God.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **Go down**  - The Midianite soldiers were camping out in a valley and were at a lower elevation than the Israelite soldiers.
    * **you will no longer be afraid**  – That is, “you will stop being afraid.”
    * **something he had dreamed**  – That is, “something he had seen in a dream” or, “a dream he had had.”

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:16-10|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:16|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:16-12|>>]]**


===== Gideon's Army [16-12] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-16-12.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Then **[[:en:key-terms/gideon|Gideon]]** returned to his soldiers and gave each of them a **horn**, a clay pot, and **a torch**. They surrounded the camp where the **[[:en:key-terms/midian|Midianite]]** soldiers were sleeping. Gideon's 300 men soldiers had the torches in the pots so the Midianites could not see the light of the torches.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **horn**  - This could be translated as, “trumpet” or, “ram's horn trumpet.” These horns came from a male sheep and were often used to call men for battle.
    * **a torch**  - This was probably a piece of wood wrapped with cloth and soaked in oil so that it could burn well. (This was not the modern torch that runs on batteries.)

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:16-11|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:16|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:16-13|>>]]**


===== The Attack [16-13] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-16-13.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Then, all of **[[:en:key-terms/gideon|Gideon's]]** soldiers broke their pots at the same moment, suddenly revealing the fire of the torches. They blew their horns and **shouted**, “**A sword for [[:en:key-terms/god|God]] and for Gideon**!”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **shouted**  - This could be translated as, “yelled loudly” or, “said with a very loud voice.”
    * **sword**  - A sword is a weapon that has a long sharp blade and a handle at one end. People hold the handle and hit or stab the enemy with the sharp blade. If your people don't have a weapon just like this, you could translate it as a “long knife,” “machete” or, “bush knife.”
    * **A sword for God and for Gideon**  - This means, “We fight for God and for Gideon!”

===== God Defeated the Midianites [16-14] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-16-14.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**[[:en:key-terms/god|God]] confused the [[:en:key-terms/midian|Midianites]]**, so that they started attacking and killing each other. Immediately, **the rest of the [[:en:key-terms/israel|Israelites]] were called**from their homes to come help chase the Midianites. They killed many of them and chased the rest of them out of the Israelites' land. 120,000 Midianites died that day. God had **[[:en:key-terms/save|saved]]** **[[:en:key-terms/israel|Israel]]**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **God confused the Midianites**  - God caused the Midianites to be confused. They wanted to attack the Israelites, but instead, they attacked each other.
    * **the rest of the Israelites**  - This could be translated as, “many other Israelite men.” This refers to the soldiers previously sent home in **[[:en:obs:notes:frames:16-10|[16-10]]]**.
    * **were called**  – That is, “were called out” or, “were summoned.” This sentence could also be translated as, “Gideon sent messengers to summon many other Israelite men from their homes.”

===== An Offering for Gideon [16-15] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-16-15.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


The people wanted to make **[[:en:key-terms/gideon|Gideon]]** their **[[:en:key-terms/king|king]]**. Gideon **did not allow them to do this**, **but he asked them**  for some of the gold rings that each of them had taken from the **[[:en:key-terms/midian|Midianites]]**. The people gave Gideon a large amount of gold.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **did not allow them to do this**  - Gideon knew that it was better for the Israelites to have God as their king.
    * **but he asked them**  – This phrase starts with “but” because what he did next was not wise.

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:16-14|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:16|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:16-16|>>]]**


===== Gideon Made an Idol [16-16] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-16-16.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Then **[[:en:key-terms/gideon|Gideon]] used the gold to make a special garment**like the **[[:en:key-terms/priest-high|high priest]]** used to wear. But the people started **[[:en:key-terms/worship|worshiping]]** it as if it were an **[[:en:key-terms/idol|idol]]**. So **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** **[[:en:key-terms/punish|punished]]** **[[:en:key-terms/israel|Israel]]** again because they worshiped idols. God allowed their enemies to defeat them. They finally asked God for help again, and God sent them another **[[:en:key-terms/deliverer|deliverer]]**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **Gideon used the gold to make a special garment**  – This could be translated as, “Gideon melted down the gold objects the people had given him and formed a special garment out of that gold.”
    * **turned away from God**  - This could be translated as, “disobeyed God” or, “stopped worshiping God.”

**[[:en:obs:notes:frames:16-15|<<]] | [[:en:obs:notes:16|Up]] | [[:en:obs:notes:frames:16-17|>>]]**


===== Sin and Deliverance [16-17] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-16-17.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**This pattern repeated many times**: the **[[:en:key-terms/israel|Israelites]]** would **[[:en:key-terms/sin|sin]]**, **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** would **[[:en:key-terms/punish|punish]]** them, they would **[[:en:key-terms/repent|repent]]**, and God would send a **[[:en:key-terms/deliverer|deliverer]]** to **[[:en:key-terms/save|save]]** them. Over many years, God sent many deliverers who saved the Israelites from their enemies.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **This pattern repeated many times**  - This could be translated as, “These things kept happening again and again” or, “These things happened many times.”

===== Israel Wanted a King [16-18] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-16-18.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**Finally**, the people **asked [[:en:key-terms/god|God]] for a [[:en:key-terms/king|king]] like all the other nations had**. They wanted a king who was tall and strong, and who could lead them into battle. **God did not like this request**, but he gave them a king just as they had asked.


//A Bible story from: Judges 1-3; 6-8//


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **Finally**  - This could be translated as, “After their enemies attacked them many times” or, “After many years of being attacked by many different nations.”
    * **asked God for a king**  - This could be translated as, “demanded that God give them a king” or, “kept asking God for a king.”
    * **like all the other nations had**  - Other nations had a king. Israel wanted to be like them and have a king too.
    * **God did not like this request**  – This could be translated as, “God did not agree with what they had asked him for.” God knew that they were rejecting him as their ruler and were instead choosing to follow a human leader.
    * //A Bible story from//  - These references may be slightly different in some Bible translations.

**[[:en:key-terms/saul|Saul]]** was the **first [[:en:key-terms/king|king]] of [[:en:key-terms/israel|Israel]]**. He was tall and handsome, just like the people wanted. Saul was a good king for the first few years that he ruled over Israel. But then he became a wicked man who did not **[[:en:key-terms/obey|obey]]** **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]**, so God chose a different man who would **one day be king in his place**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **first king of Israel**  – This could be translated as, “first king to rule over Israel.”
    * **one day**  – This could be translated as, “some time in the future” or “years later.”
    * **be king in his place**  – Another way to say this would be, “take his place as king over Israel” or, “rule as king instead of him.”

David was a **[[:en:key-terms/shepherd|shepherd]]** from the town of **[[:en:key-terms/bethlehem|Bethlehem]]**. At different times while he was **watching**  his father's **[[:en:key-terms/sheep|sheep]]**, David had killed both a lion and a bear that had attacked the sheep. David was a **[[:en:key-terms/humble|humble]]** and **[[:en:key-terms/righteous|righteous]]** man who **[[:en:key-terms/trust|trusted]]** and **[[:en:key-terms/obey|obeyed]]** God.

===== David Killed Goliath [17-03] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-17-03.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**[[:en:key-terms/david|David]]** became a great soldier and leader. When David was still a young man, he fought against **a giant named Goliath**. Goliath was a trained soldier, very strong, and almost three meters tall! But **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** helped David kill Goliath and save **[[:en:key-terms/israel|Israel]]**. After that, David won many victories over Israel's enemies, for which the people **[[:en:key-terms/praise|praised]]** him.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **a giant named Goliath**  - The word “giant” here describes a person who is unusually large and powerful. Goliath was a huge soldier in an army that was fighting against Israel.

===== Saul Chased David [17-04] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-17-04.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**[[:en:key-terms/saul|Saul]]** became jealous of the people's **[[:en:key-terms/love|love]]** for **[[:en:key-terms/david|David]]**. Saul tried many times to kill him, so David hid from Saul. **One day**, Saul was looking for David so he could kill him. Saul went into the same cave where David was hiding from Saul, but Saul did not see him. David was now very close to Saul and could have killed him, but he did not. Instead, David cut off a piece of Saul's clothes **to prove to Saul**  that he would not kill him in order to become **[[:en:key-terms/king|king]]**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **One day**  - This phrase introduces an event that happened in the past, but does not state the specific time. Many languages have a similar way to begin telling a true story.
    * **to prove to Saul**  - That is, “to convince Saul” or, “to show Saul.”
    * **to become king**  – David would not dishonor God by killing the man that God placed as king over Israel.

{{:en:obs:obs-17-05.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Eventually, **[[:en:key-terms/saul|Saul]]** died in battle, and **[[:en:key-terms/david|David]]** became **[[:en:key-terms/king|king]]** of **[[:en:key-terms/israel|Israel]]**. He was a good king, and the people **[[:en:key-terms/love|loved]]** him. **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** **[[:en:key-terms/bless|blessed]]** David and **made him successful**. David fought many battles and God helped him defeat Israel's enemies. David conquered **[[:en:key-terms/jerusalem|Jerusalem]]** and made it **his capital city**. **During David’s reign**, Israel became powerful and wealthy.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **made him successful**  - That is, “helped him accomplish the good things he wanted to do.”
    * **his capital city**  - That is, “the capital city of his kingdom.” David lived in Jerusalem and ruled from there.

For about 400 years, the people had been worshiping God and offering sacrifices to him at the **[[:en:key-terms/tent-of-meeting|Tent of Meeting]]** that **[[:en:key-terms/moses|Moses]]** had built.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **build a temple**  - David wanted to construct a permanent building for worshiping God that would replace the portable Tent of Meeting.

===== God's Promise to David [17-07] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-17-07.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


But **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** sent **the [[:en:key-terms/prophet|prophet]] [[:en:key-terms/nathan|Nathan]]** to **[[:en:key-terms/david|David]]** with this message, “Because you are a **man of war**, you will not build **this [[:en:key-terms/temple|Temple]]** for me. Your **[[:en:key-terms/son|son]]** will build it. But, I will **[[:en:key-terms/bless|bless]]** you greatly. Someone from your family will always rule as **[[:en:key-terms/king|king]]** of **[[:en:key-terms/israel|Israel]]**, and the **[[:en:key-terms/messiah|Messiah]]** will be one of your **[[:en:key-terms/descendant|descendants]]**!” The Messiah was God’s Chosen One who would save people of the world from **[[:en:key-terms/sin|sin]]**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **the prophet Nathan**  – It may be more natural in some languages to say, “a prophet named Nathan.”
    * **man of war**  - That is, “man who fights battles.” David killed many, many people in battle against the Israelites' enemies. God wasn't punishing David, but God wanted a man of peace to build the Temple where people would worship him.
    * **this Temple**  - That is, “this building for worship” or, “this place of worship.”
    * **from sin**  - That is, “from the terrible consequences of their sin.”

===== David Praised God [17-08] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-17-08.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


When **[[:en:key-terms/david|David]]** heard **these words**, he immediately thanked and **[[:en:key-terms/praise|praised]]** **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** because he had **[[:en:key-terms/promise|promised]]** David **this great honor**  and many **[[:en:key-terms/bless|blessings]]**. David did not know when God would do these things. But as it happened, the **[[:en:key-terms/israel|Israelites]]** would have to wait a long time before the **[[:en:key-terms/messiah|Messiah]]** came, almost 1,000 years.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **these words**  - That is, “the words the prophet had just said.” This refers back to the promises in **[[:en:obs:notes:frames:17-07|[17-07]]]**.
    * **this great honor**  - People who lived later would highly respect David because some of his descendants would be kings over Israel and one of them would be the Messiah.

However, **toward the end of his life**  he **[[:en:key-terms/sin|sinned]] terribly**against God.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **David ruled with justice and faithfulness for many years**  - This could be translated as, “When David ruled the people, for many years he did what was right and fair, and he was faithful to God.”
    * **toward the end of his life**  - This may be translated as, “when David was older” or “later on in David's life.”
    * **sinned terribly**  - That is, “sinned in a very evil way.” David's sin was especially evil.

    * **One day**  - This phrase introduces an event that happened in the past, but does not state the specific time. Many languages have a similar way to begin telling a true story.
    * **saw**  - Bathsheba may have been bathing at her own house, but David's palace was very high and he was able to see over walls that were lower.
    * **bathing**  - This may be translated as, “taking a bath” or, “washing herself.”

==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **Instead of looking away**  - That is, David did not look away from the woman as she bathed, as he should have done.
    * **He slept with her**  - This is a polite way to say that David had sexual relations with Bathsheba.

David called Uriah back from the battle and told him to **go be with his wife**. But Uriah refused to go home while the rest of the soldiers were in battle. So David sent Uriah back to the battle and told the general to place him **where the enemy was strongest**  so that he would be killed.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **go be with his wife**  - That is, “go home to be intimate with his wife.” David wanted people, especially Uriah, to believe that Bathsheba was pregnant with Uriah's child.
    * **where the enemy was strongest**  - That is, the location in the battle where the most fighting was going on.

David **[[:en:key-terms/repent|repented]]** of his sin and God **[[:en:key-terms/forgive|forgave]]** him.

==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **what David had done**  - This refers to David's adultery with Bathsheba and his murder of her husband, Uriah.

==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **fighting in David’s family**  - This “fighting” was very serious. Among other things, one of his sons murdered another son and tried to take David's place as king while David was still reigning. If possible, use a word that conveys the intensity of this conflict within the family.
    * **David’s power was greatly weakened**  - This might be translated as, “David became less powerful” or, “David lost much of his authority.”
    * //A Bible story from//  - These references may be slightly different in some Bible translations.

==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **the wilderness**  - This was a remote location with very few people. This may also be translated as, “desert” or, “the bush.”
    * **The drought**  - This could be translated as, “the lack of rain.” This drought was a result of Elijah declaring that there would be no rain.

    * **the famine**  - If needed, this could be translated as, “the famine caused by the drought.”
    * **took care of**  – This means they gave him a place to stay in their house and provided food for him. It does not mean he was sick.
    * **God provided for them…never became empty**  - This could be translated as, “God prevented their flour jar and their bottle of oil from becoming empty” or, “God caused…to never become empty.”
    * **flour jar**  - This refers to a clay jar in which the widow kept her supply of flour.

Bring all the people of the kingdom of Israel to **Mount Carmel**.”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **speak with Ahab because he was going to send**  – This could be translated as, “tell Ahab that God was going to send.”
    * **you troublemaker**  - This means, “You are a troublemaker!” Ahab was accusing Elijah of causing trouble by telling the king that he was doing wrong and also by stopping the rain.

    * **Mount Carmel**  - Mount Carmel is the name of a mountain located in northern Israel. It is over 500 meters high.

==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **Mount Carmel**  - See how you translated this in **[[:en:obs:notes:frames:19-05|[19-05]]]**.
    * **How long will you**  - This is not a real question asking for information. Elijah was rebuking the Israelites for repeatedly changing their minds about whether they would serve Yahweh or Baal. Some languages will have to express this as a statement such as, “Stop changing your minds about whom you will worship!”
    * **If Yahweh is God…If Baal is God**  - This does not mean that Elijah was undecided. He knew that Yahweh is the real God. He wanted the people to understand that when they worship false gods, they are rejecting Yahweh as the only true God. Translate this in a way that shows that the people had to make a choice.

    * **who answers with fire**  - That is, “who supernaturally sends fire to burn up the sacrifice.”

{{:en:obs:obs-19-08.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Then the **[[:en:key-terms/prophet|prophets]]** of **[[:en:key-terms/baal|Baal]]** **[[:en:key-terms/pray|prayed]] to Baal**, “Hear us, Baal!” All day long they prayed and **shouted**  and even **cut themselves with knives**, but **there was no answer**.

===== God Answered with Fire [19-11] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-19-11.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Immediately, fire **fell from the sky**  and burned up the meat, the wood, the rocks, the dirt, and even the water that was around the **[[:en:key-terms/altar|altar]]**. When the people saw this, they **fell on the ground**  and said, “**[[:en:key-terms/yahweh|Yahweh]] is [[:en:key-terms/god|God]]**! Yahweh is God!”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **fell from the sky**  - This may be translated as, “suddenly came down from the sky.”
    * **fell on the ground**  - They quickly lay down or knelt down on the ground. They were afraid of Yahweh because they had seen his power. They knew that only the true God could do that and bowed down to honor and worship him.

===== Killing the Prophets of Baal [19-12] =====

Then **[[:en:key-terms/elijah|Elijah]]** said, “Do not let any of the **[[:en:key-terms/prophet|prophets]]** of **[[:en:key-terms/baal|Baal]] escape**!” So the people **captured**  the prophets of Baal. Then Elijah took them away from there and killed them.

    * **escape**  - The prophets of Baal tried to run away after their god was proven to be a false god.
    * **captured**  – That is, “seized and held onto” or, “took hold of.”

Then **[[:en:key-terms/elijah|Elijah]]** said to **[[:en:key-terms/king|King]]** **[[:en:key-terms/ahab|Ahab]]**, “Return immediately to the city, because the rain is coming.” Soon **the sky grew black**, and a heavy rain began. **[[:en:key-terms/yahweh|Yahweh]]** had ended the **drought**  and proved that he is the true **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]**.

===== Naaman Came to Elisha [19-14] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-19-14.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


After the time of **[[:en:key-terms/elijah|Elijah]]**, **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** chose a man named Elisha to be his **[[:en:key-terms/prophet|prophet]]**. God did many **[[:en:key-terms/miracle|miracles]]** through Elisha. One of the miracles happened to **[[:en:key-terms/naaman|Naaman]]**, **an enemy commander**, who had a horrible skin disease. **He had heard of Elisha**  so **he went and asked Elisha**  to **[[:en:key-terms/heal|heal]]** him.

===== Naaman Was Healed [19-15] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-19-15.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


At first **[[:en:key-terms/naaman|Naaman]]** was angry and **would not do it because it seemed foolish**. But later **he changed his mind**  and dipped himself seven times in the **[[:en:key-terms/jordan-river|Jordan River]]**. When he came up the last time, his skin was completely **[[:en:key-terms/heal|healed]]**! **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** had healed him.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **would not do it because it seemed foolish**  - Naaman would not do what Elisha said because he knew that washing alone could not heal his disease.
    * **he changed his mind**  - That is, “he decided to do what Elisha had told him to do.”

{{:en:obs:obs-19-16.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** sent many other **[[:en:key-terms/prophet|prophets]]**. They all told the people to stop **[[:en:key-terms/worship|worshiping]]** **[[:en:key-terms/idol|idols]]** and to **start showing [[:en:key-terms/justice|justice]] and [[:en:key-terms/mercy|mercy]]** to others. The prophets warned the people that if they did not stop doing **[[:en:key-terms/evil|evil]]** and start **[[:en:key-terms/obey|obeying]]** God, then God would **[[:en:key-terms/judge|judge]]** them as **[[:en:key-terms/guilt|guilty]]**, and he would **[[:en:key-terms/punish|punish]]** them.

===== Jeremiah Suffered for God [19-17] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-19-17.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Most of the time, the people did not **[[:en:key-terms/obey|obey]]** **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]**. They often mistreated the **[[:en:key-terms/prophet|prophets]]** and sometimes even killed them. Once, the prophet **[[:en:key-terms/jeremiah|Jeremiah]]** was put into a **dry well**  and left there to die. He sank down into the mud that was in the bottom of the well, but then the **[[:en:key-terms/king|king]] had [[:en:key-terms/mercy|mercy]] on him**and ordered his servants to pull Jeremiah out of the well before he died.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **dry well**  - The well did not currently have any water in it, but it did still have mud in the bottom. This could be translated as, “empty well.”

===== The Message of the Prophets [19-18] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-19-18.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


The **[[:en:key-terms/prophet|prophets]] continued to speak for [[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** even though the people hated them. They warned people that God would destroy them if they did not **[[:en:key-terms/repent|repent]]**. They also reminded people **of the [[:en:key-terms/promise|promise]] that God’s [[:en:key-terms/messiah|Messiah]] would come**.


//A Bible story from: 1 Kings 16-18; 2 Kings 5; Jeremiah 38//


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **continued to speak for God**  - That is, “continued to tell the people what God wanted to tell them.”
    * **of the promise that God's Messiah would come**  – This could be translated as, “that God had promised that his Messiah would come to save his people.”

They **broke the [[:en:key-terms/covenant|covenant]]** that God had made with them at **[[:en:key-terms/sinai|Sinai]]**. God sent his **[[:en:key-terms/prophet|prophets]]** to **warn them to [[:en:key-terms/repent|repent]]** and **[[:en:key-terms/worship|worship]]** him again, but they refused to **[[:en:key-terms/obey|obey]]**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **broke the covenant**  - That is, “disobeyed the commands God had given them in his covenant with them at Mount Sinai.”
    * **warn them to repent and worship him again**  – Another way to translate this would be, “tell them to stop sinning and to worship Yahweh instead of other gods, or terrible things would happen to them.”

{{:en:obs:obs-20-02.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


So **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** **[[:en:key-terms/punish|punished]] both kingdoms**by allowing their enemies to destroy them. The **[[:en:key-terms/assyria|Assyrian Empire]]**, a powerful, cruel nation, destroyed the **[[:en:key-terms/kingdom-of-israel|kingdom of Israel]]**. The Assyrians killed many people in the kingdom of Israel, **took away**  everything of value, and burned much of the country.

    * **both kingdoms**  - This refers to both the kingdoms of Israel and Judah.
    * **Empire**  - A country was called an “empire” when it was powerful enough to extend its authority over many other countries.

Only the very poor **[[:en:key-terms/israel|Israelites]]** who had not been killed **remained**  in the **[[:en:key-terms/kingdom-of-israel|kingdom of Israel]]**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **skills**  – This refers to practical skills such as woodworking, metalworking, and building.

But they still **[[:en:key-terms/worship|worshiped]]** **[[:en:key-terms/idol|idols]]**, including the **[[:en:key-terms/god-false|gods]]** of the **[[:en:key-terms/canaan|Canaanites]]**. God sent **[[:en:key-terms/prophet|prophets]]** to **warn them**, but **they refused to listen**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **for not believing and obeying him**  – Another way to translate this would be, “because they did not believe or obey him.”
    * **warn them**  – That is, “tell them to stop sinning or terrible things would happen to them.”

{{:en:obs:obs-20-06.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


About 100 years after the **[[:en:key-terms/assyria|Assyrians]]** destroyed the **[[:en:key-terms/kingdom-of-israel|kingdom of Israel]]**, **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** sent **[[:en:key-terms/nebuchadnezzar|Nebuchadnezzar]]**, **[[:en:key-terms/king|king]]** of the **[[:en:key-terms/babylon|Babylonians]]**, to attack the **[[:en:key-terms/kingdom-of-judah|kingdom of Judah]]**. **[[:en:key-terms/babylon|Babylon]]** was a powerful **empire**.

==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **leaving…behind**  - That is, “leaving only the poorest people in Judah” or, “letting only the poorest people stay in Judah.”
    * **This period of time**  - To translate this, choose a phrase that can refer to a long time, since this exile period lasted seventy years.

===== Persia Defeated Babylon [20-11] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-20-11.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


About **seventy years later**, **Cyrus**, the **[[:en:key-terms/king|king]]** of the **Persians**, defeated **[[:en:key-terms/babylon|Babylon]]**, so the Persian Empire replaced the Babylonian Empire. **The [[:en:key-terms/israel|Israelites]] were now called [[:en:key-terms/jew|Jews]]** and most of them had lived their whole lives in Babylon. Only a few very old Jews even remembered **the land of Judah**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **seventy years later**  - This refers to the seventy years that had passed since the Babylonian army took the people of Jerusalem into exile.
    * **Cyrus**  - Cyrus was also called, “Cyrus the Great.” The name “Cyrus” meant “like the sun” in the Persian language. However, since Cyrus was an important historical person, it might be best to transliterate his name, rather than translating the meaning.
    * **Persians**  - The Persian Empire grew to cover the area from central Asia to Egypt. Its home was located in the general area of modern-day Iran.
    * **The Israelites were now called Jews**  - This could also be translated as, “People now called the Israelites by the name 'Jews.'”
    * **the land of Judah**  - That is, the area where the kingdom of Judah was located before the Exile. Jerusalem was the capital city of Judah.

{{:en:obs:obs-20-12.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


The **Persian Empire**  was strong but **[[:en:key-terms/mercy|merciful]]** to the people it conquered. Shortly after **Cyrus**  became king of the Persians, he gave an order that any **[[:en:key-terms/jew|Jew]]** who wanted **to return to Judah**  could leave Persia and go back to Judah. He even gave them money to rebuild the **[[:en:key-terms/temple|Temple]]**! So, after seventy years in **exile**, a small group of Jews **returned**  to the city of **[[:en:key-terms/jerusalem|Jerusalem]]** in Judah.

    * **Persian Empire**  - See how you translated this term in **[[:en:obs:notes:frames:20-11|[20-11]]]**.
    * **Cyrus**  - See how you translated his name in **[[:en:obs:notes:frames:20-11|[20-11]]]**.
    * **Judah**  - See the note about Judah in **[[:en:obs:notes:frames:20-11|[20-11]]]**.
    * **to return to Judah**  - Since most of these Jews were the children and grandchildren of those who left Judah, they had never lived in Judah before. In some languages it might be better to say “to go to Judah.”
    * **exile**  - See how you translated this term in **[[:en:obs:notes:frames:20-09|[20-09]]]**.
    * **returned**  – That is, “went back.” Some languages may prefer to say, “went” since most of these people had never been to Jerusalem.

===== Messiah Will Defeat Satan [21-01] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-21-01.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**From the very beginning**, **[[:en:key-terms/god|God]]** planned to send the **[[:en:key-terms/messiah|Messiah]]**. The first **[[:en:key-terms/promise|promise]]** of the Messiah came to **[[:en:key-terms/adam|Adam]]** and **[[:en:key-terms/eve|Eve]]**. God promised that a **[[:en:key-terms/descendant|descendant]]** of Eve would be born who would **crush the snake’s head**. **The snake who deceived Eve was [[:en:key-terms/satan|Satan]]**. The promise meant that the Messiah would defeat Satan completely.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **From the very beginning**  - That is, from when the earth was first created.
    * **crush the snake’s head**  - Unless the head of a venomous snake is crushed, the snake can still hurt someone. Use a word for “crush” that communicates that its head is destroyed.
    * **The snake…was Satan**  – Satan spoke to Eve in the form of a snake. This does not mean that he is a snake now. This could be translated as, “The snake…was an appearance of Satan.”
    * **who deceived Eve**  - That is, “who lied to Eve.” The snake lied by making Eve doubt what God had said and tricking her into disobeying God.

In the New Covenant, God would **write his law on the people’s hearts**, the people would **know God**  personally, they would **be his people**, and God would **[[:en:key-terms/forgive|forgive]]** their **[[:en:key-terms/sin|sins]]**. The **[[:en:key-terms/messiah|Messiah]]** would **start the New Covenant**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **Through the prophet Jeremiah God promised**  – This could be translated as, “Through the messages that God gave to Jeremiah, God promised” or, “The prophet Jeremiah told the people God's promise.”
    * **but not like**  - The New Covenant would be truly effective. People really would know God, they would truly live as his people, and He would forgive their sins completely, based on the Messiah's sacrifice of himself one time for all who believe in him.
    * **write his law on the people’s hearts**  - This is a metaphor meaning, “help his people to understand his laws and to earnestly desire to obey them.” If possible, keep the image of writing on their hearts, since this is in contrast with the way God had written his law on stone tablets for the Israelites. If that is not possible, you could just translate the meaning.
    * **be his people**  - This could be translated as, “be his special people” or, “be his favored people.”
    * **start the New Covenant**  - That is, “be the one to cause the New Covenant to take effect” or, “bring the New Covenant to his people.”

Priests also **[[:en:key-terms/pray|prayed]]** to God for the people. The **[[:en:key-terms/messiah|Messiah]]** would be the **perfect [[:en:key-terms/priest-high|high priest]]** who would **offer himself**  as a **perfect sacrifice**  to God.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **on behalf of**  - This may be translated as, “for the benefit of” or, “in the place of.”
    * **as a substitute for the punishment for their sins**  - God allowed people to bring animals to sacrifice for their sin as a reminder of the punishment that they deserved and their dependence on God to remove their sin. God accepted these sacrifices as a temporary covering for sin and did not punish the people for it.
    * **perfect high priest**  - Unlike the other high priests, the Messiah would never sin, and he would permanently take away all the sins of the people.
    * **offer himself**  – That is, “allow himself to be killed.”

    * **Micah**  - Micah was an Old Testament prophet of God who, like Isaiah, spoke his messages from God almost 800 years before the Messiah came.

He also predicted that the **[[:en:key-terms/messiah|Messiah]]** would **[[:en:key-terms/heal|heal]]** sick people and those who **could not hear, see, speak, or walk**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **broken-hearted people**  - This expression refers to people who are experiencing extreme sadness.

    * **could not hear, see, speak, or walk**  – It may be better to say, “could not hear, could not see, could not speak, or could not walk.” Some languages have special words for these conditions, such as “deaf” and “blind.”
