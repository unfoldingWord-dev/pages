**Source Text**  â€“ If the language you select does not have a source text already available on the page, you will see a header on the page that says "This page does not exist yet". You can save some time by starting with a source text from another language. Here is a [[http://youtu.be/uGvMsS1nerk|video]] (2 minutes) showing the following steps:


    - Click the back button in your browser to return to the same page in the previous language.
    - Click the "Edit this page" button (or "View the page source").
    - Select all the text in the editing window.
    - Copy the text (Control-C).
    - Click the "Cancel" button to leave the edit box and return to the page view.
    - Choose your desired language in the language selection dropdown.
    - Click "Create this page".
    - Click on the DWEdit button. If the window refreshes, click on "Create this page".
    - Paste the contents of the original page into the edit box.
    - Click the "Save" button. The edit window closes and the new created page shows.
