====== 41. God Raises Jesus from the Dead ======


===== Overview: =====


The Jewish leaders were afraid the disciples would steal Jesusâ€™ body and say He rose from the dead. They asked Pilate for soldiers to guard the tomb. But when some women came to put spices on His body, an angel opened the tomb and showed them that Jesus was not there. As they ran to tell the disciples, Jesus appeared to them. He told the women to tell the disciples that He was alive.
