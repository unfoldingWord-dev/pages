====== 29. The Story of the Unmerciful Servant ======


===== Overview: =====


Peter asked Jesus how many times he should forgive a brother. So Jesus told the story of a servant who owed a huge debt to the king. The king took pity on him and cancelled the debt. But the servant sent another man who owed him a small amount to prison. This made the king very angry. Jesus told Peter that we should forgive others in the same way that we are forgiven.
