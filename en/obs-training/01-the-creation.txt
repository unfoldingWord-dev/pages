====== 1. The Creation ======


===== Introduction =====


//the purpose of this section is to provide a concise summary of the story and what we learn about God and His Word from it.// 


**Overview:** In this story, God creates everything, including people, and all animals, in 6 days…


**Emphasis of the story:** 


One of the most basic questions that every person has is, "Where did I come from?" This story is the God's answer to that question. It is not presented as a fable, but as the true account of what really happened. In this story, we learn that the eternal, all-powerful God created everything that exists. He then made human beings "in His image" to have a special relationship with Him and to enjoy and care for his creation. When God completed his work of creation after six days, everything was good. There was no sin or imperfection, and we had everything we needed for an abundant life.
