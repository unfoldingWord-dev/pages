====== Translation Guidelines ======

//The following statement on the principles and procedures used in translation is subscribed to by all member organizations of and contributors to the [[http://unfoldingword.org|unfoldingWord]] project. All translation activities are carried out  according to these common guidelines.//

  - **Accurate** — Translate accurately, without detracting from, changing, or adding to the meaning of the original text. Translated content should faithfully communicate as precisely as possible the meaning of the original text as it would have been understood by the original audience.
  - **Clear** — Use whatever language structures are necessary to achieve the highest level of comprehension. This includes rearranging the form of a text and using as many or as few terms as necessary to communicate the original meaning as accurately as possible.
  - **Faithful** — Use key terms that are faithful to the vocabulary of the original Biblical languages, even where such terms are considered offensive in receptor cultures. Divine familial terms should be retained in translated content and clarified, as needed, in footnotes or other supplemental resources.
  - **Authoritative** — Use the original language Biblical texts as the highest authority for translation of Biblical content. Reliable Biblical content in other languages may be used for clarification and as intermediary source texts.
  - **Pure** — Avoid any political, ideological, social, cultural, or theological bias in the translation.
  - **Expressive** — Communicate the feelings and attitudes of the original text. Maintain the literary forms in the original text, including narrative, poetry, exhortation, and prophecy, representing them with corresponding forms that provide similar communicative functions in the receptor language.
  - **Historical** — Communicate historical events and facts accurately, providing additional information as needed in order to accurately communicate the intended message to people who do not share the same context and culture as the original recipients of the original content.
  - **Natural** — Use language forms that are effective for the specific target audience and that reflect the way the language is used in everyday conversation.
  - **Collaborative** — Work together with other believers who speak the receptor language to translate, check, and distribute the translated content, ensuring that it is of the highest quality and available to as many people as possible.
  - **Ongoing** — Encourage the periodic review of translations to ascertain when revision or a new translation is needed.
