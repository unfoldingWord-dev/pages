==== Translation Notes: ====


 * his people - This could be translated as, "his people, the Israelites" or "his people, the Jews." But only include the added information if it is not clearly understood who these people were.
 * 400 years went by - Another way to say this would be, "400 years passed" or "there were 400 years." 400 years had passed since the last Old Testament prophet, Malachi.
 * when he did not speak to them â€“ That is, "during which God did not give any messages to the prophets for his people."
 * godly people - That is, "people who obeyed God."

The angel said to Zechariah, "Your wife will have a son. You will name him John. He will be filled with the Holy Spirit, and will prepare the people for the Messiah!" Zechariah responded, "My wife and I are too old to have children! How will I know this will happen?"

The angel responded to Zechariah, "I was sent by God to bring you this good news. Because you did not believe me, you will not be able to speak until the child is born." Immediately, Zechariah was unable to speak. Then the angel left Zechariah. After this, Zechariah returned home and his wife became pregnant.

When Elizabeth was six months pregnant, the same angel suddenly appeared to Elizabeth's relative, whose name was Mary. She was a virgin and was engaged to be married to a man named Joseph. The angel said, "You will become pregnant and give birth to a son. You are to name him Jesus and he will be the Messiah."

Mary replied, "How can this be, since I am a virgin?" The angel explained, "The Holy Spirit will come to you, and the power of God will overshadow you. So the baby will be holy, the Son of God." Mary believed and accepted what the angel said.

Soon after the angel spoke to Mary, she went and visited Elizabeth. As soon as Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, Elizabeth's baby jumped inside her. The women rejoiced together about what God had done for them. After Mary visited Elizabeth for three months, Mary returned home.

After Elizabeth gave birth to her baby boy, Zechariah and Elizabeth named the baby John, as the angel had commanded. Then God allowed Zechariah to speak again. Zechariah said, "Praise God, because he has remembered his people! You, my son, will be called the prophet of the Most High God who will prepare the people to receive the Messiah!"
