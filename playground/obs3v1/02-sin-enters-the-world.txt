====== 2. Sin Enters the World ======


{{:en:obs:obs-02-01.jpg?nolink&640x360}}




 * Adam
 * God
 * sin


==== Translation Notes: ====


 * garden - A special collection of trees and plants that God prepared for Adam and Eve to enjoy and from which to eat. This should be the same word that was used in [[:en:obs:notes:frames:01-11|[01-11]. See how you translated it there.
 * talked with God - The word for "talk" should be the same as would be used to refer to talking to a human being. God may have taken a physical form to talk to the man and the woman since the text indicates that they talked to him face-to-face.
 * shame - The feeling that comes with knowing we have sinned or that we fall short in some way. Before sin came into the world, there was no sense of shame about being naked.

 * God


==== Translation Notes: ====


 * crafty - Clever and sly, with the intent to deceive.
 * snake - An elongated, legless land creature that now moves by wiggling on its belly. Although later on in the story it is revealed that the snake is Satan, this should not be said here in this frame.
 * Did God really tell you - The snake asked the woman whether God actually said not to eat from any of the trees in the garden. But he was only pretending that he didn't know what God had said because he wanted to create doubt in the woman's mind. He wanted her to question God's goodness.
 * fruit of any of the trees - All of the various types of fruit from each of the different trees in the garden.

 * God
 * good
 * evil
 * die


==== Translation Notes: ====


 * fruit - We don't know what kind of fruit this was. We only know that it grew on this tree. If possible it is best to use a general word for fruit here, and not a word for a specific kind of fruit.
 * tree of the knowledge of good and evil - The woman correctly understood that they were not allowed to eat from this one tree that would enable them to understand evil as well as good.
 * you will die - Use your ordinary word for death, for a person's physical life to end. Don't avoid the term just because the thought of death sounds too harsh.

 * true
 * die
 * God
 * good
 * evil


==== Translation Notes: ====


 * like God - The man and the woman were already made in the likeness of God. The snake is suggesting that the woman would be more like God if she understood evil. However, God never intended for her to have this knowledge.
 * understand good and evil - To know from personal experience what things are good and what things are bad, or being able to know whether something is good or bad.

 * wise


==== Translation Notes: ====


 * wise - The woman wanted to have insight and understanding like the snake seemed to have, and like God has.
 * who was with her - This is important information because it shows that the man was present when the woman made the decision to eat the fruit.

==== Translation Notes: ====


 * their eyes were opened - This could be translated as, "they saw things differently." This expression means they now understood something for the first time. In your language, there may be an expression with similar meaning that you could use to translate this.
 * realized they were naked - After the man and the woman disobeyed God, they felt ashamed that they were naked. That is why they used leaves to try to cover their naked bodies.
 * cover their bodies - The man and the woman attempted to use leaves to hide themselves from God.

 * God
 * Adam


==== Translation Notes: ====


 * God walking - It seems that God regularly came to the garden to walk and talk with the man and the woman. We do not know what this looked like. If it is possible, it is best to use the same word that would be used to talk about a person walking.
 * Where are you? - God already knew the answer to this question. The purpose of the question was to force the man and the woman to explain why they were hiding.

 * God


==== Translation Notes: ====


 * Who told you that you were naked? - Or, "How did you find out that you were naked?" God already knows the answer to all of his questions. By asking this question and the following question, he was giving Adam the opportunity to admit his sin of disobedience. Being naked was not a sin. God created them that way. Their knowledge of their nakedness was the problem. Their shame showed that they had sinned.
 * she gave me the fruit - The man blamed the woman rather than confessing his disobedience and accepting responsibility for disobeying God.
 * What have you done? - Or, "Why have you done this?" God already knew the answer to this question. By asking this question, he was giving the woman the opportunity to admit her guilt. He was also implying that she should not have done what she did.
 * The snake tricked me - The snake deceived or misled her. He lied to her. Don't use a word that indicates that he cast a spell on her or bewitched her. The woman blamed the snake rather than confessing her disobedience and accepting responsibility for disobeying God.

 * God


==== Translation Notes: ====


 * childbirth very painful - Some languages may need to express this as a verb. You could say, "I will cause you to have much more pain when you give birth to children."

 * God
 * disobeyed
 * cursed
 * die
 * Eve
 * Adam


==== Translation Notes: ====


 * ground is cursed - As punishment for Adam's disobedience, the earth would no longer be fruitful. Adam would have to work very hard to raise enough food to eat.
 * you will die - The ultimate punishment for their disobedience was death. Spiritual death is our separation from God. Physical death is our separation from our body.
 * return to dirt - God created Adam from the dirt or soil and gave him life. As a result of sin, his life will be taken from him and his body will decompose and become dirt again.
 * Eve, which means 'life-giver' - God gave life to Adam and Eve, and it is passed on to every person through childbirth.
 * mother of all people - This means that she would be the female ancestor of all people. Some languages say "she would be the grandmother of all people."
