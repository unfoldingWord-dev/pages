 * Egypt


==== Translation Notes: ====


 * made without yeast – Yeast is something that is mixed into bread dough to make bread rise as it cooks. This could be translated as, "made without something that would make it rise." Making the bread with yeast would have taken much longer, so cooking the bread without yeast was a way to be prepared to leave Egypt quickly.
 * when they ate – This means they needed to be prepared to leave before they started to eat.

 * Israelites
 * God
 * Egypt


==== Translation Notes: ====


 * every firstborn son - This means every firstborn son of families who had not made the blood sacrifice, that is, the Egyptians. To make this clear you may want to add, "Every Egyptian firstborn son" (since all the Israelite families had put the blood on their doorposts).

 * saved
 * lamb's


==== Translation Notes: ====


 * passed over - This means that God passed by those houses and did not stop to kill anyone there. This phrase became the name of the Jewish festival, "Passover."
 * They were saved - God did not kill their firstborn son.
 * because of the lamb's blood - This could be translated as, "because the lamb's blood was on their door." God saw that they had killed their lamb as he had commanded, so he did not kill their son.

 * Egyptians
 * believe
 * God


==== Translation Notes: ====


 * did not believe God or obey his commands – In some languages it may be more natural or clear to say, "did not believe God and so they did not obey his commands."
 * did not pass over - He did not pass by their houses. Rather he stopped at each house and killed their eldest son.

 * from the firstborn of the prisoner in jail, to the firstborn of Pharaoh - This is a way of saying that everyone's firstborn son died–from the son of the least important person to the son of the most important person, and everyone in between.
