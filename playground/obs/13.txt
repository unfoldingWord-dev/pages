{{:en:obs:obs-13-01.jpg?nolink&640x360}}




 * God
 * Israelites
 * Red Sea
 * Sinai
 * Moses


==== Translation Notes: ====


 * burning bush - Before Moses returned to Egypt, God had spoken to him from a shrub that was on fire, but that was not burned up by the fire. See [[:en:obs:notes:frames:09-12|[09-12].
 * set up their tents - The Israelites had to travel a great distance from Egypt to the Promised Land. So they took tents with them so that they could set them up as shelters and sleep in them along the way. Some languages could translate this as, "hung their tents."
 * base of the mountain – This could be translated as, "bottom of the mountain." This refers to the area of land that is located next to the place where the ground starts to slant upward to form a mountain.

 * God
 * Moses
 * Israel
 * obey
 * covenant
 * kingdom
 * priests
 * holy


==== Translation Notes: ====


 * keep my covenant - This could be translated as, "do what my covenant requires you to do." Obeying and keeping the covenant are not two different things. One way to make this clear would be to say, "obey me by keeping my covenant." God will soon tell them what his covenant requires.
 * my prized possession - This could be translated as, "You will be my possession that I value most" or, "You will be the people that I treasure more than any other group of people" or, "You will be my own precious people."
 * You will be…a kingdom of priests - This could be translated as, "I will be your king and you will be like priests." The Israelites were supposed to teach the other nations about God and be a mediator between God and the nations just as there were priests in the nation of Israel to go between God and the Israelites.

 * God
 * Mount Sinai
 * Moses


==== Translation Notes: ====


 * Three days later - In other words, three days after they arrived at Mount Sinai and God first spoke to them.
 * prepared themselves spiritually - This refers to ceremonial cleansing in preparation to meet with God. This could be translated as, "got ready to meet with God" or, "prepared themselves to meet with God."
 * loud trumpet blast - This could be translated as, "and a loud sound came from a horn" or, "and a horn was blown and it made a loud sound" or, "and they heard the loud sound of a horn blowing." Trumpets were made out of ram's horns. They were used that day to call the people to gather at the mountain and meet with God.
 * Only Moses was allowed to go up - This could be translated as, "God permitted Moses to go up, but he did not permit anyone else to go up."

 * God
 * covenant
 * Yahweh
 * saved
 * slavery
 * Egypt
 * worship
 * gods


==== Translation Notes: ====


 * Then God gave them the covenant and said - What God says next is the content of the covenant, that is, he tells the people the things that they must obey. This could be translated as, "Then God told them His covenant. He said" or, "Then God made this covenant with them:"
 * Yahweh your God - In some languages it might be more natural to change the order and say "your God Yahweh." Make sure it does not sound like the Israelites had more than one God. It should be clear that Yahweh is the only God. Another way to translate this would be, "Yahweh, who is your God" or, "your God, whose name is Yahweh."
 * who saved you from slavery - This could be translated as, "I freed you from slavery."

 * idols
 * worship
 * Yahweh
 * God
 * Sabbath day
 * holy
 * seventh day


==== Translation Notes: ====


 * (God continues speaking to Moses.)
 * I, Yahweh, am a jealous God - This could be translated as, "I, Yahweh, will be angry if you worship or honor anything besides me." God strongly desires that his people love, serve, and obey Him more than anything or anyone else. He must be the only master of their lives.
 * Do not use my name in a disrespectful way - This could be translated as, "Do not talk about me in a way that does not show respect and honor" or, "Talk about me in a way that gives me proper respect and honor."
 * seventh day - To translate this, it is best to use the number ("seventh") rather than give the name of a specific day of the week.
 * to remember me - This could be translated as, "to keep me in mind" or, "to honor me."

==== Translation Notes: ====


 * (God continues speaking to Moses.)
 * Do not commit adultery - This could be translated as, "Do not have sexual relations with someone else's spouse" or, "Do not have marital relations with another man's wife or another woman's husband." Be sure to translate this in a way that doesn't offend or embarrass people. Languages often have an indirect, polite way of saying this, such as, "Do not sleep with."
 * Do not lie - This means, "Do not say false things about other people."

 * covered the person's sin - When people brought animals to sacrifice, God chose to see the blood of the animals as a covering over their sin. This is like hiding something that is ugly or dirty by covering it.
 * clean in God's sight - This could be translated as, "as if he did not have the sin according to God" or, "free of the punishment for breaking God's law."
