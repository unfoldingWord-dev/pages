\s Galatians 2:1-10 
\s Finally, when I returned to Jerusalem and told Peter, James, and John what I always proclaim, they agreed that Barnabas and
I were preaching the same message and serving the Lord just like they were.
\p
\v 1 After fourteen years passed, I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas. I took Titus also.
\v 2 But \add I tell you that\add* I went up there because of what God revealed to me.
\add It was not because someone asked me to come\add*. I told people what was the good message that I was preaching in regions
where non-Jews live. But I talked privately to those whom your new teachers highly respect. I did that in order that what I was
doing and what I had done \f + \ft metaphor \f* might not become useless \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add as a result of people rejecting my message because they
thought that I was teaching something that was not true\add*. 
\v 3 But \add even though the leaders of the believers usually insisted that when non-Jews trusted in Christ someone must
circumcise them\add*, they did not even insist that Titus be circumcised, even though he was a Greek man who was with me.
\v 4  \add I talked to them privately\add* because some people \add successfully\add* pretended that they were fellow believers
and associated with the true believers. They did that in order that they might observe closely what we do because we are free
\add from having to obey all the Jewish laws and rituals\add* because of our close relationship with Christ Jesus \f + \ft metaphor \f*. Those
people wanted to make us \add like\add* slaves \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add of those rituals by convincing us that we cannot trust Christ solely
but that we must also obey all the Jewish rituals\add*. 
\v 5 But not even briefly did we\add (exc)\add* do what they wanted
\add about circumcision. We(exc) resisted them\add* in order that the truth of the message about Christ might continue to
\add benefit\add* you. 
\v 6 The \add leaders in Jerusalem\add*, whom your new teachers respect, did not add anything to what I preach.
\add And I would add that\add* what status those leaders had did not influence me, because God does not favor certain\f + \ft Or: important \f*
persons \f + \ft idiom \f* more than others. 
\v 7 Instead of those leaders adding to the message that I tell people, they understood that I had been given the good message
{God had given the good message to me} so that I might proclaim it to the non-Jews \f + \ft metonymy \f*, just like
\add God\add* had given the good message to Peter so that he might tell it to those who are Jews \f + \ft metonymy \f*.
\v 8 That is, just like \add God\add* had empowered\f + \ft Or: authorized \f* Peter in order that he might be an apostle
\add to bring God's message\add* to the Jews \f + \ft metonymy \f*, he also had empowered\f + \ft Or: authorized \f* me in order that I might be an apostle to
\add bring his message to\add* the non-Jews. 
\v 9 And \add those leaders\add* knew that God had kindly given to me this special work. So James, Peter, and John, the ones
whom your new teachers \add respect because they are\add* leaders \f + \ft metaphor \f*
\add of the believers\add*, shook hands with us \f + \ft idiom \f* \add to show that they agreed that Barnabas and I are serving the Lord
just like they are, and that we are preaching the same message that they are
preaching\add*. They also agreed that we\add (exc)\add* are the ones whom God was sending to
\add tell his message to\add* non-Jews, but that God is sending them to
\add tell his message to\add* Jews \f + \ft metonymy \f*. 
\v 10 They merely urged that we\add (exc)\add* still remember to help the poor
\add fellow believers who live in Jerusalem\add*. That is exactly what I have been eager to do.
\s Galatians 2:11-21 
\s Later I rebuked Peter for not behaving according to the gospel, in that he was encouraging non-Jews to adopt Jewish laws and
rituals. 
\p
\v 11 But \add later while I was at\add* Antioch \add city\add*, after Peter came there, I told him directly \f + \ft synecdoche \f* that what he
was doing was wrong. 
\v 12  \add This is what happened\add*. \add Peter went to Antioch and started eating regularly with non-Jewish believers
there\add*. Later there were certain \add Jewish believers who\add* came
\add to Antioch who claimed that\add* James, \add the leader of the congregations in
Jerusalem\add*, had sent them. But when \add those certain\add* men came, Peter gradually quit
\add eating\add* with the non-Jewish believers and would not associate with them. He was afraid that the Jewish
\add believers from Jerusalem would criticize him for associating with
non-Jews\add*. 
\v 13 Also, the other Jewish \add believers who were in Antioch\add* \f + \ft synecdoche \f* acted ◄insincerely\f + \ft Or: in \f* a way that they knew was not
right► along with \add Peter\add*. The result was that they convinced even Barnabas to
\add stop associating with the non-Jewish believers!\add* 
\v 14 But when I realized that they were not acting according to the truth of the message about Christ,
\add when\add* all \add the fellow believers there\add* were present, I told Peter
\add the following\add*: “Although you\add (sg)\add* are a Jew, \add you often conduct
yourself\add* like non-Jews \add do by disregarding Jewish laws about food. When you are among
non-Jews\add*, you\add (sg)\add* do not customarily conduct yourself at all like Jews
\add do\add*. So, ◄now it is wrong that you\add (sg)\add* are causing non-Jews
\add to think that they must obey all\add* the Jewish rituals and customs!\f + \ft Or: why \f* are
you\add (sg)\add* causing non-Jews \add to think that they must obey
all\add* the Jewish rituals and customs?► \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*” 
\v 15 Some of us \add believers\add* were born as Jews. We\add (exc)\add* were
\bd not born as non-Jews.\bd* \add We Jews have always considered non-Jews to
be\add* \bd ‘sinners’\bd* \add because they do not obey the Jewish rituals and
laws\add*. 
\v 16 But we\add (exc)\add* now know that it is not because some person obeys the laws
\add that God gave to Moses\add* that \add God\add* erases the record of that person's sins.
\add God erases the record of a person's sins only if that person trusts in what Jesus Christ has
done\add*. Even we\add (exc)\add* Jews trusted \bd Christ Jesus.\bd*
We\add (exc)\add* did that in order that \add God\add* would erase the record of our sins because of our trusting Christ, and
not because of our obeying the laws \add that God gave to Moses. God has said
that\add* he will \add never\add* erase the record of people's sins just
\bd because of their obeying those laws.\bd* 
\v 17 Furthermore, because we\add (exc) Jews\add* desired that \add God\add* would erase the record of our sins because of our
relationship with Christ, \add it means that\add* we realized that we ourselves were sinners
\add like non-Jews, whom we called\add* sinners, \add because we(exc) also were not obeying the Jewish rituals and
laws\add*. \add But\add* \add we(inc) certainly cannot conclude\add* that it is Christ who causes us to
sin.\f + \ft Or: \add should we conclude\add* that it is Christ who causes us to sin? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\add No, Christ\add* certainly does not \add cause anyone to sin\add*.
\p
\v 18 So if I should again believe \add that God would erase the record of my sins because of my obeying the laws that he gave
to Moses\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add I would be like a man who\add* rebuilds an old building that he tore down. It would
\add soon\add* be clear that I am one who disobeys those same laws
\add that God gave to Moses\add*. 
\v 19 When \add I realized that I could not earn God's favor\add* by
\add obeying\add* the laws \add that he gave to Moses, I decided
not\add* to \add respond to what those laws demanded\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*,
\add just like\add* a dead person \add does not respond to anything\add*. Now I live to
\add honor\f + \ft Or: serve \f*\add* God. 
\v 20  \add It is as though\add* I was with Christ when he was crucified {died on the cross} \f + \ft metaphor \f* \f + \ft Or:
\add It is as though\add* my \add old way of life ended when\add* Christ died on the cross. \f* No longer am I
\add directing the way I behave as I did before I believed in Christ\add*. Now Christ
\add is directing how\add* I\add behave. And whatever I do\add* now while I live, I do it trusting in God's Son. He is the one
who loved me and offered himself \add as a sacrifice\add* for me.
\v 21 I am not rejecting \add as useless\add* what God \add did for
me\add* \add kindly\f + \ft Or: that I did not deserve\add* \f*, \add as my opponents are doing. I fully accept that God saved me by acting
kindly towards me\add*. If it is because people \add obey the\add* laws
\add that God gave to Moses\add* that God erases the record of their sins, then Christ died for nothing\f + \ft Or: needlessly \f*.
