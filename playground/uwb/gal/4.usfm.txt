\c 4  
\s Galatians 4:1-7 
\s Each of you is no longer like a slave, but a child of God and an heir of what he has promised.
\p
\v 1 Now, I \add will further\add* discuss \add children and heirs\add*:
\add An heir is a person who will later\add* control all that his father has. But as long as that heir is a child, others
\add control\add* him, with the result that he is just like a slave \f + \fr metaphor \f*.
\v 2 Until the \add day that\add* his father \add previously\add* determined,
\add other\add* persons supervise him and manage his property. 
\v 3 Likewise, when we\add (inc)\add* \f + \fr (OR, we\add (exc) Jews\add*) \f* were
\add like\add* young children \f + \fr metaphor \f*, we had to obey rules and rituals about external and material things. These rules
controlled us like \add masters control their slaves\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f*.
\v 4 But exactly at the time \f + \fr metonymy \f* \add that God had previously determined\add*, he sent
\add Jesus\add*, who is ◄his Son/the man who is also God►, into the world. Jesus was born to a
\add human\add* mother. He had to obey the laws \add that God gave to
Moses\add*. 
\v 5 God sent Jesus in order that he might redeem us who had to obey
\add God's\add* laws. God wanted us all to receive from \add God\add* the status of being his children \f + \fr metaphor \f*.
\v 6 Furthermore, we know that we are God's children because God sent the Spirit, who is intimately related to his Son, to live
in our ◄inner beings/hearts►. \add The Spirit enables us to\add* pray fervently, “Daddy, Father!”
\add This shows that we are God's children\add*. 
\v 7 So, \add because of what God has done\add*, no longer is \add each
of\add* you \add like\add* a slave. Instead, \add each of you is\add* a child
\add of God\add*. Furthermore, since \add each of you is God's\add* child, God has also made you one who will receive all that
he has promised. 
\s Galatians 4:8-20 
\s I plead with you to do as I did when I was with you, and not obey all the Jewish rules and rituals.
\p
\v 8 When you did not have a relationship with God \f + \fr metaphor \f*, you served gods that really did not exist \f + \fr metaphor \f*. You were their
slaves. 
\v 9 But now you have come to know God. Perhaps \add it would be better to say
that\add* now God knows you. \add So now you are acting foolishly\add*! ◄You are again believing
\add that by obeying\add* rules and rites \add you will benefit spiritually\add*!/Why are you again believing
\add that by obeying\add* rules and rituals \add you will benefit
spiritually\add*?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* \add Those rules are\add* ineffective and inadequate! ◄You are wanting to
\add obey them\add* again \f + \fr metaphor \f* like slaves obey their masters./Are you wanting to
\add obey them\add* again \f + \fr metaphor \f* like slaves obey their masters?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*
\v 10 You \add non-Jews\add* are carefully practicing \add Jewish rules and rituals about what you should
do\add* ◄on \add Sabbaths/on Jewish days of rest\add*► and \add on the first day of
each\add* month and on\add special\add* seasons and years. 
\p
\v 11 I ◄worry/am concerned► about your\add mistaken ideas. I do not
want\add* to have \add so\add* strenuously served you in vain. 
\v 12 My fellow believers, I strongly urge you that you do as I do.
\add Stop thinking that you have to obey ◄Jewish rules and rituals/ceremonial
laws\add*►. \add When I was with you\add*, I \add did not obey all the Jewish rules and
rituals\add*, just like you \add did not obey them\add*. 
\p \add At that time\add* you treated me entirely as you should have \f + \fr litotes \f*.
\v 13 You know that the first time I told the good message to you,
\add I went to your area to regain my health, because I was physically
weak\add*. 
\v 14  \add Although\add* you might have \add despised me because\add* I was physically weak, you did not despise me or act
contemptuously/disrespectfully toward me. Instead, you welcomed me like
\add you would welcome\add* an angel from God. \add You welcomed
me\add* like \add you would welcome\add* Christ Jesus! 
\v 15 ◄I am disappointed that you have forgotten \add that then\add* you
\add declared that you were\add* pleased with \add me\add*./Have you forgotten
\add that then\add* you \add declared that you were\add* pleased with
\add me\add*?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* I can testify that you \add would have done anything to help
me\add*. You would have gouged out your eyes \add and\add* given them to me,
\add if that would have helped me!\add* 
\v 16 So I am very disappointed that you \add now\add* act as though \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* I have become hostile to you
\add because I have kept\add* speaking the true \add message about
Christ\add* to you. 
\v 17 Those \add who are insisting on obeying Jewish rules\add* are eagerly
\add showing interest in\add* you, but \add what they are doing is\add* not good. They even want you not to associate with
\add me and other true\add* believers, because they want you to eagerly show
\add interest in\add* them, \add not in us\add*. 
\v 18 But \add just like\add* it always feels good to have others show that they appreciate you,
\add I would like you\add* always \add to appreciate me\add*, and not only when I am with you.
\v 19 You \add who are like\add* my children, \add once\add* again I am very worried/concerned about you \f + \fr metaphor \f*,
\add and I will continue to\add* be worried/concerned until Christ's
\add nature be developed\add* in you \add completely and wholeheartedly\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f*
\add as a child\add* becomes developed \add in his mother's womb\add*.
\v 20 But I do wish that I could be with you now and that I might talk
\add more gently with you\add*, because I do not know \add what to do
about\add* you \add while we are apart\add*. 
\s Galatians 4:21-31 
\s Because of our relationship with Christ we are not subject to Mosaic law; being Abraham's spiritual descendants we are free
from such bondage. 
\p
\v 21 Some of you desire \add to obey all the laws\add* that God gave Moses.
\add I say that\add* you \add should\add* consider \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* \add the implications of what Moses wrote
in\add* the Scriptures. 
\v 22  \add He\add* wrote that Abraham became the father of two sons. His female slave,
\add Hagar\add*, bore one son, and his \add wife Sarah\add*, who was not a slave, bore the other.
\v 23 Also, \add the sons differed. Ishmael\add*, the \add son born
by\add* the female slave, was conceived naturally. But \add Isaac\add*, the
\add son born by\add* his wife who was not a slave, was conceived
\add miraculously\add* as a result of what \add God\add* had promised
\add Abraham\add*. 
\v 24  \add I am telling you this\add* as an illustration. These
\add two women\add* symbolize two agreements. \add God made\add* the first
\add agreement, which involved obeying the laws that God gave to
Moses\add* at \add Sinai\add* Mountain. \add Because that agreement forces those who accept it to keep obeying all its
rules\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f*, \add it is like a slave mother who\add* gives birth to slaves.
\add So\add* Hagar, \add the female slave, symbolizes\add* this \add agreement\add*.
\v 25 Also, the \add word\add* ‘Hagar’ is \add associated with\add* Sinai Mountain,
\add which is\add* in Arabia \add land. Hagar, the female slave,
also\add* represents Jerusalem \add city\add* as it is today. Jerusalem
\add city\add* is \add like\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f* a slave \add mother, and those who live
there\add* \f + \fr personification \f* \add are like\add* her slave children \f + \fr metaphor \f* \add because they all must obey the laws that God gave to
Moses\add*. 
\v 26 But there will be a \add new\add* Jerusalem in heaven \f + \fr metonymy \f*, and we
\add who will go there\add* are free \add from having to obey Jewish
laws\add*. We \add who belong to that city consider it to be\add* our mother \f + \fr metaphor \f*
\add city because we are God's true children\add*. 
\v 27  \add Our new city will have more people than those who live in Jerusalem now. It will be just
like\add* Isaiah foretold about \add the people whom he expected would come back to Jerusalem from exile. He expected that they
would be more numerous than those who\add* were taken into exile. He wrote:
\q \add You who live in Jerusalem, you will\add* rejoice! Now you have no children, like a barren
\add woman\add* who does not give birth to \add children! But some day you
will\add* shout \add with joy\add*, ◄without restraint/as loudly as you can►,
\add even though now you are few, like a woman who\add* cannot give birth
\add to children, and you\add* feel deserted\add . You will be very
happy\add* because \add you will have many children who will come to you. Those children will
be\add* more than\add the children\add* any woman with a husband
\add could have borne\add*. 
\p
\v 28 Now, \add my\add* fellow believers, you have become children
\add of God as a result of believing God's\add* promise to us, as Isaac
\add was born as a result of Abraham believing what God promised to
him\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f*. 
\p
\v 29  \add Also, long ago Abraham's son\add* Ishmael, the one who was conceived naturally, caused trouble for
\add Abraham's son\add* Isaac, who \add was conceived\add* supernaturally \f + \fr metaphor \f*. Similarly, now
\add those who think that we must obey the laws that God gave Moses in order that God will save us are causing trouble for
those who are trusting Abraham's descendant, Christ\add*. 
\v 30 But these are \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* the words in the Scriptures \f + \fr personification \f*: “The son of the
\add woman\add* who was not a slave will inherit \add what his father
has\add*. The female slave's son will certainly not inherit those things. So send away from
\add this place\add* the female slave and her son \f + \fr metaphor \f*!” \add That means that you should certainly expel from your groups
those who insist that we obey all the laws God gave Moses\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f*.
\v 31  \add My\add* fellow believers, \add Hagar symbolizes the laws that God gave to Moses. But we are not those who must obey
all the laws that God gave to Moses\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f*. \add So\add* we are not
\add the\add* female slave \add Hagar's spiritual\add* descendants \f + \fr metaphor \f*. But
\add Sarah's descendants are those who were born as a result of believing what God promised to Abraham. So we
are\add* the \add spiritual\add* descendants of \add Sarah, the woman\add* who was not a slave \f + \fr metaphor \f*.
