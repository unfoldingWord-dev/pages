\v 1  \add I\add*, Paul, \add write this letter to you. I remind you that I
am\add* an apostle. That is not because a group of people \add appointed
me\add*, nor because a human being \add sent me to be an apostle\add*. Instead, Jesus Christ and God
\add our heavenly\add* Father, who caused Jesus to become alive again after he died, have
\add appointed and\add* sent \add me to be an apostle\add*. 
\v 2 All the fellow believers \add who are here\add* with me \add approve of this message that I am writing. I am sending this
letter\add* to the congregations that\add are\add* in Galatia \add province\add*.
\v 3  \add I pray that\add* God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ will kindly
\add help\add* you and enable\add you to have inner\add* peace. 
\v 4 Christ offered himself \add as a sacrifice\add* in order that
\add he might remove the guilt for\add* our sins. He did that in order that he might enable us to not
\add do the evil things that people who do not know him\add* do.
\add He did this\add* because God, who is our Father, wanted it.
\v 5  \add I pray that people will\add* praise God forever. ◄May it be so!/Amen!►
\s Galatians 1:6-10 
\s I am disappointed that you are believing a message that is not the good news about Christ, and I ask God to eternally punish
those who are teaching such a message. 
\p
\v 6 I am very disappointed \f + \fr irony \f* that so soon \add after you trusted in
Christ\add* you have turned away from \add God\add*. He chose you in order that
\add you might have what\add* Christ freely/kindly gives. I am also disappointed that so soon you are believing a different
\add message which some say is\add* “good news.” 
\v 7 Their message is not a true message. \add What is happening is
that\add* certain persons are confusing your \add minds\add*. They are desiring to change the good message ◄that Christ
\add revealed/about\add* Christ► \add and are creating another message\add*.
\v 8 But even if we\add (exc) apostles\add* or an angel from heaven would tell you a message that is different from the good
message that we told you \add before\add*, I \add appeal to God\add* that
\add he\add* punish such a person \add forever\add*. 
\v 9 As I told you previously, so now I tell you this once more: Someone is telling you
\add what he says is\add* a good message, but it is a message that is different from
\add the good message\add* that I gave you. So I \add appeal to God\add* that
\add he\add* severely punish that person. 
\v 10  \add I said that\add* because \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* I do not desire that people approve me,
\add contrary to what some have said about me\add*. It is God whom I desire to approve me.
\add Specifically, I do not say and do\add* \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* things just to please people. If it were still people whom I was trying to
please, then I would not be one who \add willingly and completely\add* serves Christ.
\s Galatians 1:11-12 
\s It was Jesus Christ, not any human, who revealed the message that I proclaim.
\p
\v 11 My fellow believers, I want you to know that the message about Christ that I proclaim to people is not one that some
person \add created/thought up\add*. 
\v 12 I did not receive this message from a human \add messenger\add*, and no
\add human being\add* taught it to me. Instead, Jesus Christ revealed it to me.
\s Galatians 1:13-24 
\s For seventeen years after God showed his Son to me, I had no contact with the apostles.
\p
\v 13 People have told you how I behaved formerly when \add I practiced\add* the Jewish religion. They told you that I
continually did very harmful things to the groups of believers that God
\add established\add*, and they told you that I tried to get rid of those people.
\v 14 I practiced the Jewish religion more thoroughly than many \add other
Jews\add* who were my age practiced it. I much more enthusiastically tried to get others to obey the traditions that my
ancestors \add kept\add*. 
\v 15 Nevertheless, before I was born \add God\add* ◄set me apart/selected me►. He chose me
\add to live eternally\add*, something that I did not deserve. 
\v 16 He wanted me to know that Jesus is his Son, so that I would tell others the message about his Son in regions where
non-Jews live. But I did not immediately go to any human beings \f + \fr synecdoche \f* in order to gain
\add an understanding of that message. I received it directly from
Christ!\add* 
\v 17 I did not \add immediately\add* leave Damascus and go to Jerusalem
\add for that purpose\add* to those who were apostles before I was. Instead, I went away to Arabia
\add region, a desert area\add*. Later I returned once more to Damascus
\add city\add*. 
\v 18 Then three years after \add God revealed this good message to
me\add*, I went up to Jerusalem in order that I might meet Peter. But I stayed with him for
\add only\add* fifteen days, \add which was not long enough for him to teach me thoroughly about
Christ\add*. 
\v 19 I also saw James, the brother of our Lord \add Jesus and the leader of the believers there,
but\add* I did not see any other apostle. 
\v 20 God knows that what I am writing to you is completely true \f + \fr litotes \f*!
\v 21 After \add I left Jerusalem\add*, I went to \add the regions
of\add* Syria and Cilicia. 
\v 22  \add At that time people in\add* the Christian congregations that are in Judea
\add province\add* still had not met me \f + \fr synecdoche \f* personally. 
\v 23 They only heard \add others say about me\add* repeatedly, “\add Paul\add*, the one who was formerly doing harmful things
to us, is now telling the \add same message\add* which we believe and which formerly he was trying ◄to destroy/to cause people
to stop believing►!” 
\v 24 And they praised God because of \add what had happened to\add* me.
