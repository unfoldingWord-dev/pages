\s Galatians 5:1-6 
\s Reject the false teaching that you must be circumcised, and do not become enslaved to rules and rituals again, otherwise
Christ will not benefit you at all. 
\p
\v 1 It is in order that we might live without ◄being obliged \add to\f + \ft Or: having \f*
to\add*► \add obey all the Jewish rituals\add* that Christ freed us
\add from God condemning us because of our disobeying those rituals\add*. So, firmly
\add reject the false teaching that someone must circumcise you,
and\add* do not \add live like\add* slaves again \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* \add by letting others force you to obey those rules and rituals
again\add*. 
\v 2 Consider very carefully what I, Paul, \add an apostle\add*, now tell you: If you are permitting yourself to be circumcised
{someone to circumcise you}, what Christ \add has done for you\add* will not benefit you at all.
\v 3 Instead, I solemnly declare again to every man who is circumcised {has someone circumcise him}
\add in order for God to accept him\add*, that you must \add perfectly\add* obey all of the laws
\add that God gave Moses, in order for God to save you\add*. 
\v 4 Those of you who are sure that God will erase the record of your sins because you obey the laws
\add that God gave to Moses\add*, you have separated yourselves from Christ. You have abandoned\f + \ft Or: rejected \f*
\add God's true method of saving you, which was\add* by kindly erasing the record of your sins, in a way that you did not
deserve. 
\v 5 But we who have a relationship with Christ and who trust in Christ are eagerly waiting to receive what God's Spirit
assures us that we can expect. We can expect to receive it because God has erased the record of our sins.
\v 6 As for us who have a relationship with Christ Jesus, God is not concerned whether we are circumcised or not circumcised.
Instead, God is concerned about whether we trust \add in\add* Christ, with the result that we love
\add other people\add*. 
\s Galatians 5:7-12 
\s Although someone has confused you, I am sure that you will not accept his false teaching, and that God will punish him.
\p
\v 7 You were progressing well \add spiritually\add* \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f*. You should not have let someone influence you so that
\add now you\add* are not believing the true \add message about Christ\add* \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f*!
\v 8  \add God\add*, the one who chose you, is not the one who is persuading you to think like this!
\v 9  \add Remember that this false doctrine that someone is teaching you will affect all of you, just
like\add* \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* a little yeast causes all of the dough to swell up.
\v 10  \add Nevertheless\add*, because of my relationship with the Lord, I am certain that you will think only as I do
\add about forcing people to obey rules and rituals\add*. Furthermore,
\add God\add* will punish anyone who is confusing you \add by teaching this false
message\add*, even if he is an important person. 
\v 11 But, my fellow believers, \add although someone claims that I am proclaiming that men must be circumcised, I certainly am
not still proclaiming that. Remember that the Jews are still\add*
◄\add persecuting me\f + \ft Or: causing \f* me to suffer\add*►. If I were still proclaiming that men must be circumcised
\add in order for God to accept them\add*, ◄the Jews would not be persecuting me.\f + \ft Or: why \f* would the Jews be persecuting me?► \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f*
\add They would\add* \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* not be \add persecuting me\add*\f + \ft Or: causing \f* me to suffer
\add because\add* then \add the Jews\add* would no longer be offended.
\add They\add* ◄\add are offended\f + \ft Or: do \f* not want to accept what I teach\add*►
\add because I proclaim that Christ, the Messiah, died on\add* the cross \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f*.
\v 12 I \add would even\add* wish that those who are disturbing you
\add by insisting that men be circumcised\add* would also emasculate \\f + \\ft euphemism \\f* themselves,
\add with the result that they would be expelled from your congregations\add*!
\s Galatians 5:13-15 
\s Although you are free from having to obey Jewish rules, instead of doing what your self-directed nature desires, love and
serve each other. 
\p
\v 13 My fellow believers, \add God\add* chose you in order that
\add you might live\add* without having to \add obey rules and rituals\add*. But
\add do not assume that because\add* you are free \add from having to obey rules and
rituals\add*, \add God\add* permits you to \add do what your\add* self-directed nature
\add desires\add*. Instead, constantly, as you love \add each other\add*, serve each other.
\v 14 Keep in mind that we can sum up all of the laws \add that God
has\add* given us in one law, which is: “You must love each person you come in contact with, just like
\add you love\add* yourself.” 
\v 15 Since you are attacking and injuring \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* each other \add by the things that you
say\add* \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f*, I warn you that \add if you continue doing that\add*, you will totally ruin each other
\add spiritually\add*. 
\s Galatians 5:16-18 
\s Let God's Spirit direct you, and then you will not do what your self-directed nature desires.
\p
\v 16  \add So\add* I tell you this: Constantly let \add God's\add* Spirit direct you.
\add If you do that\add*, you will certainly not do the things that your self-directed nature wants
\add you to do\add*. 
\v 17 Your self-directed nature ◄opposes \add God's\add* Spirit\f + \ft Or: does \f* not
\add want you to do what\add* God's Spirit \add wants you to do\add*►, but also his Spirit opposes your self-directed nature.
These two are always ◄fighting with\f + \ft Or: opposing \f*► each other. The result is that you do not
\add constantly\add* do the \add good\add* deeds that you truly desire
\add to do\add*. 
\v 18 But when you are led by God's Spirit {when God's Spirit directs you}, you
\add can do what pleases God\add*, now that you are no longer obligated
\add to obey all\add* the laws \add that God gave Moses\add*. 
\s Galatians 5:19-24 
\s Those who think evil thoughts and do evil things will not receive the blessings of God's rule, but God's Spirit produces
many good qualities in our lives. 
\p
\v 19  \add You already know\add* how \add people think and\add* act \\f + \\ft personification \\f* because of their self-directed nature. These are
\add some of the things that they do: People\add* are sexually immoral.
\add People\add* commit unnatural sexual acts. \add People\add* act indecently.
\v 20  \add People\add* worship false gods \add and\add* things \add that\add* represent those gods.
\add People\add* perform ◄rituals in order that evil spirits might act for them\f + \ft Or: sorcery \f*►.
\add People\add* are hostile \add to others. People\add* quarrel
\add with each other. People\add* are ◄jealous\f + \ft Or: resent \f* other people's status►.
\add People\add* behave angrily. \add People\add* try ◄to get others to think highly of them\f + \ft Or: to \f* exalt themselves► and ◄do not
consider what others want\f + \ft Or: act \f* selfishly►. People do not associate
\add with others. People\add* associate only with those who agree
\add with them\add*. 
\v 21  \add People\add* want what others have. \add People\add* get drunk.
\add People\add* ◄revel\f + \ft Or: participate \f* in wild parties►. And \add people do
other\add* things like these. I warn you \add now\add*, just like I warned
\add you previously\add*, that the ones \add who constantly\add* act
\add and think\add* like this will not receive \add what\add* God
\add has for his own people when he begins\add* to rule over us.
\v 22 But \add God's\add* Spirit causes \add us to do these things\add*: We love
\add others\add*. We are joyful. We are peaceful. We are patient. We are kind. We are good. We are
\add ones whom\add* others can trust. 
\v 23 We are gentle. We control our behavior. There is no law that says people should not
\add think and act in such ways\add*. 
\v 24 Furthermore, we who belong to Christ Jesus have \add stopped
obeying\add* our self-directed nature and \add stopped doing\add* all the evil things that we desire to do \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f*.
\add It is as though\add* \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* we nailed them to the cross! 
\p
\v 25 Since \add God's\add* Spirit has caused us to \add be spiritually\add* alive, we should
\add conduct our lives the way the\add* Spirit \add directs us\add*.
\v 26 We should not be saying how great we are. We should not be making ourselves more important than others. We should not
envy each other.
