\c 3  
\s Galatians 3:1-5 
\s Because you trusted in Christ, not because you obeyed the laws God gave Moses, you received the Holy Spirit and now
experience his working among you. 
\p
\v 1 You \add fellow believers who live in\add* Galatia are very foolish! ◄Someone must have put an evil spell on you!/Did
someone put an evil spell on you?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* I clearly explained to you \f + \fr synecdoche \f*
\add what\add* Jesus Christ \add accomplished when\add* he was crucified {he died on the cross}.
\v 2  \add So\add*, I want you to tell me one thing: \add Do you think
that\add* it was because you obeyed the laws God gave Moses that you received the
\add Holy\add* Spirit? \add Do you not know that\add* \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* it was because
\add when you\add* heard \add the good message concerning Christ,
you\add* trusted in him? 
\v 3 You are acting so foolishly \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*! You first \add became Christians\add* as a result of God's Spirit
\add enabling you\add*. So ◄do you now think it is by your own human efforts that you will continue
\add to grow spiritually?/you\add* should not now think that it is by what you yourselves do that you will continue
\add to grow spiritually\add*!► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* 
\v 4 Keep in mind that \add if what God has done for you was because of your obeying the laws that God gave to Moses
and\add* not because of trusting in Christ, when others caused you to suffer, ◄you suffered many things needlessly!/did you not
suffer many things needlessly?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* \add I certainly hope that you did not suffer like
that\add* needlessly. 
\v 5  \add When God now\add* generously gives to you his Spirit and performs miracles among you,
\add do you think that it is\add* \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* because you obey the laws
\add that God gave to Moses? Surely you know that\add* it is because when you heard
\add the good message about Christ\add*, you trusted in him \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*!
\s Galatians 3:6-12 
\s It is those Jews and non-Jews who trust Christ who are Abraham's spiritual descendants, because those who seek to be
justified by obeying the laws that God gave Moses are condemned by God.
\p
\v 6  \add What you have experienced is\add* as \add Moses wrote in the Scriptures
about\add* Abraham. \add He wrote that Abraham\add* trusted God, and as a result, he was considered as being righteous
{\add God\add* erased the record of his sins}. 
\v 7 You must realize, therefore, that it is those who trust \add in what Christ has done
who\add* are \add like\add* Abraham's descendants \f + \fr metaphor \f* \add because they trust in God as Abraham
did\add*. 
\v 8 Furthermore, God planned beforehand that it was \add when\add* non-Jews trusted
\add him\add* that he would erase the record of their sins. \add Moses wrote
in\add* the Scriptures \f + \fr personification \f* this good message that God told Abraham: “Because of
\add what\add* you \add did\add*, I will bless \add people in\add* \f + \fr metonymy \f* all nations.”
\v 9 So, \add we can conclude that\add* it is those who trust \add in what Christ has
done\add* whom \add God\add* blesses. That includes \add all non-Jews and Jews who trust
him\add*, along with Abraham, the one who trusted him \add long ago\add*.
\v 10 That is, God will eternally punish all those who \add mistakenly\add* think
\add that God will erase the record of their sins\add* as a result of
their\add obeying\add* the laws \add that God gave to Moses\add*. What is written in the Scriptures is that
\add God\add* will eternally punish everyone who does not continuously and completely obey all the laws
\add that Moses wrote\add*. 
\v 11 But God has declared that if he erases the record of anyone's sins, it will not be as a result of their obeying the laws
God gave Moses. \add This is evident because the Scriptures say\add*, “Every person whose record of sins God erases because
that person trusts God will live \add spiritually\add*.” 
\v 12 But \add when God gave\add* his laws \add to the Jews, he did\add* not
\add say that a person must\add* trust \add him\add*. Instead \add God said
that\add* it is those who obey \add all God's laws, continuously and
completely\add*, who will live. 
\s Galatians 3:13-14 
\s Christ was condemned instead of us, so that God might bless the non-Jews just as he blessed Abraham, and so that we might
receive the Spirit. 
\p
\v 13 Even though we humans have not continuously and completely obeyed God's laws, Christ rescued us from
\add God\add* punishing us eternally. Christ rescued us by his being
\add the one God condemned\add* instead of God condemning us. What is written
{\add someone/Moses\add* wrote} \add in the Scriptures\add* shows that this is true. It is written
{\add He\add* wrote}, “\add God has already\add* decided that he will punish eternally anyone
\add whom people execute for his crimes and whose body they\add* hang on a tree.”
\v 14 Christ rescued us in order that as a result of what Christ Jesus
\add has done, God might bless the non-Jews, in a way similar to the
way\add* God blessed Abraham. He also desired that as a result of our trusting
\add Christ\add*, we \add all\add* might receive the Spirit \add whom
God\add* promised to \add give to\add* us. 
\s Galatians 3:15-18 
\s By giving his laws to the Jews, God has not canceled what he promised to Abraham much earlier concerning his descendant,
Christ. Just like God gave his blessings to Abraham just because he promised to do so, he freely gives his blessings to us.
\p
\v 15 My fellow believers, I will now \add illustrate\add* by referring to human
\add relationships. After an agreement is confirmed by two people\add*
{\add two people have signed\add* an agreement}, no one can reject it or add to it.
\v 16  \add God\add* declared to Abraham and his descendant that he was promising
\add to give blessings to Abraham\add*. \add The words that God spoke were not “and
your\add* descendants.” \add He was not\add* referring to many persons. Instead, he was referring to one person, who is Christ,
\add because the words that God spoke were\add*, “and your descendant.”
\v 17 This is what I am saying: \add Since God\add* gave the laws
\add to the Jews\add* 430 years after \add he declared to Abraham what he was promising to do for
Abraham\add*, those laws do not cancel that agreement \add with\add* Abraham that God himself had previously agreed about
\f + \fr personification \f*. 
\v 18 Remember that if it is because \add we obey God's\add* laws
\add that he gives to us\add* what \add he has\add* promised \add to give to
us\add*, then it is not \add just\add* because he \add has\add* promised
\add that he would give those things to us\add*. God freely gave to Abraham
\add what he had promised to give to him, just\add* because \add God
had\add* promised \add that he would give it to him. Similarly, it is not because we obey God's laws that God gives to us what
he has promised to give to us\add*. 
\s Galatians 3:19-25 
\s God gave his laws to supervise us sinful Jews until Christ, Abraham's promised descendant, would come.
\p
\v 19 So, \add if someone should ask\add*, “Why \add did God later
give\add* his laws \add to Moses?” I would reply that\add* it was in order that
\add people might realize\add* how sinful they were. \add Those laws were
valid\add* until \add Jesus came. He was\add* the descendant that God
\add was referring to when he made\add* the promises to Abraham.
\add The laws\add* were given {\add God\add* gave \add his laws\add*}
\add to Moses\add* by God's causing angels to \add speak to him. Moses was
the\add* mediator, \add the one who told the laws to the people\add*.
\v 20 Now, \add when\add* a mediator \add functions\add*, one \add person\add* is not
\add speaking with another\add* directly; but God himself \add made his promises directly to
Abraham\add*. 
\p
\v 21  \add If someone should ask, “When God gave his\add* laws \add to
Moses\add* long \add after he told Abraham\add* what he was promising
\add to give to him, was he\add* changing his mind?” \add I would reply that
God\add* certainly did not \add change his mind when he did that!\add* If God had given a law that could enable people to live
\add eternally\add*, then it actually would be because of people
\add obeying that\add* law that God would erase the record of their sins.
\v 22 But instead, \add what we read in\add* the Scriptures \f + \fr personification \f* is that God
\add caused all people to be unable to escape being punished for\add* their
\add sins\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f*, just like \add people\add* in prison \add are unable to
escape\add* [PRS, MET]. \add God did that in order that he might give what he promised to those who trust Jesus Christ,
just\add* because they trust him. 
\v 23 Before \add God revealed the good message about\add* trusting
\add in Christ\add*, the laws \f + \fr personification \f* that God gave to Moses were \add confining/imprisoning us
Jews\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f*, \add as\add* a prisoner \add in jail is\add* confined.
\add We\add* were unable to escape \add obeying those\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f*
\add laws\add*. This happened in order that \add we might believe\add* the good message
\add concerning Christ, the message that God would\add* reveal \add later\add*.
\v 24  \add Like a father supervises his immature son by appointing
a\add* servant to take care of him \f + \fr metaphor \f*, \add God\add* was supervising us
\add by\add* his laws [MET, PRS] until Christ came. \add He did this\add* in order that he might erase the record of our sins
\add only\add* because we trust \add Christ\add*. 
\v 25 But \add now that God\add* has revealed the message \add about trusting in
Christ\add*, the laws \add that God gave to Moses\add* are no longer supervising us
\add Jews\add* [PRS, MET]. 
\s Galatians 3:26-29 
\s Because of our relationship with Christ we are Abraham's spiritual descendants, and God's heirs, no longer like slaves.
\p
\v 26 Now all of you \add Jews and\add* non-Jews are \add as though you
are\add* God's children because you trusted Christ Jesus. 
\v 27 That is, you who \add began a relationship\add* with Christ when you were baptized identified yourselves \f + \fr metaphor \f* with
Christ. 
\v 28  \add If you are believers, it does\add* not \add matter to God if you
are\add* Jews or non-Jews; slaves or ones \add who are\add* not slaves; males or females, because all of you are
\add as\add* one \add sort of person because of your relationship\add* with Christ Jesus.
\v 29 Furthermore, since you belong to Christ, you are \add like\add* Abraham's descendants
\add because you trust God as Abraham did\add*, and you will possess/receive all that God has promised \f + \fr metaphor \f*.
