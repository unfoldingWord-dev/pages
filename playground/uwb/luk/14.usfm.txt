\c 14  
\s Luke 14:1-6 
\s Jesus told the Jewish leaders that they were being hypocritical about not helping people on the Sabbath.
\p
\v 1 One ◄Jewish day of rest/Sabbath day►, Jesus went to eat [SYN] at the house of an important Pharisee. Some
\add men who studied the Jewish\add* laws and other Pharisees who were there were watching him carefully
\add to see if he would do something for which they could accuse
him\add*. 
\v 2 Unexpectedly, there was a man in front of Jesus whose arms and legs were swollen.
\v 3 Jesus said to them, “Is it permitted in \add our(inc)\add* Jewish laws to heal
\add someone\add* ◄on our Jewish rest day/on the Sabbath►, or not?”
\v 4  \add They knew that their laws permitted it, but they thought that healing was work, which they thought was wrong to
do\add* ◄on the Sabbath/on the Jewish rest day► (OR\add , they knew that their laws permitted it, but they did not want to
admit it\add*). So they did not reply. Then Jesus put his hands on the man and healed him. Then he told him to go
\add home\add*. 
\v 5 Then he said to the rest of them, “If you had a son or an ox that fell into a well on a ◄Sabbath/our day of rest►, would
you immediately \add work to\add* pull him out, \add or would you(sg) let him stay there until the next
day\add*?” 
\v 6  \add They knew that they would immediately work to pull him out, even on their day of rest, so they could not justly say
that Jesus did wrong by healing the man on that day. So\add* they said nothing to reply to Jesus.
\s Luke 14:7-11 
\s Jesus taught that we should not try to make ourselves seem important.
\p
\v 7 Jesus noticed that those people who had been {whom \add the
Pharisee\add* had} invited \add to the meal\add* chose \add to sit
in\add* the places where important \add people usually sit\add*. Then he gave
\add this advice\add* to them: 
\v 8 “When one of you\add (sg)\add* is invited by someone {someone invites one of
you\add (sg)\add*} to a wedding feast, do not sit in a place where important people sit. Perhaps the man
\add giving the feast\add* has invited a man more important than
you\add (sg)\add*. 
\v 9  \add When that man comes\add*, the man who invited both of you will come to
you\add (sg)\add* and say to you, ‘Let this man take your seat!’ Then
you\add (sg)\add* will have to take the most undesirable seat, and you will be ashamed.
\v 10 Instead, when you are invited {\add someone\add* invites one of you}
\add to a feast\add*, go and sit in the most undesirable seat. Then when the man who invited everyone comes, he will say to
you\add (sg)\add*, ‘Friend, sit in a better seat!’ Then all the people who are eating with
you\add (sg)\add* will see that he is honoring you. 
\v 11 Also, \add remember this\add*: \add God\add* will humble those who exalt themselves. And
\add he\add* will exalt those who humble themselves.” 
\s Luke 14:12-14 
\s Jesus taught that we should share with others who cannot repay us.
\p
\v 12  \add Jesus\add* also said to \add the Pharisee\add* who had invited him to the meal, “When
you\add (sg)\add* invite people to a midday or evening meal, do not invite your friends or your family or your other relatives
or your rich neighbors. They can later invite you\add (sg) for a
meal\add*. In that way they will repay you. 
\v 13 Instead, when you\add (sg)\add* give a feast, invite poor \add people\add*, crippled
\add people\add*, lame \add people\add*, or blind \add people\add*.
\v 14 They will be unable to repay you. \add But God will bless you!
He\add* will repay you \add at the time\add* when \add he causes\add* righteous people to become alive again.”
\s Luke 14:15-24 
\s Jesus taught that many Jews would reject God's invitation to come to him.
\p
\v 15 One of those who were eating with him heard him say that. He said to Jesus, “God
\add has truly\add* blessed \add us Jews\add* who will eat \add with the
Messiah\add* when he starts to rule!” 
\v 16 But \add to show that many Jews whom God had invited would not accept God's
invitation\add* [MET], Jesus replied to him, “One time a man \add decided\add* to prepare a large feast. He invited many people
to come. 
\v 17 When it was the day for the feast, he sent his servant to tell those who had been {whom he had} invited, ‘Come
\add now\add* because everything is ready!’ 
\v 18 But \add when the servant did that\add*, all of the people
\add whom he had invited\add* began to say why they did not want to come. The first
\add man the servant went to\add* said, ‘I have just bought a field, and I must go there and see it. Please
\add ask your master to\add* forgive me for not coming!’ 
\v 19 Another person said, ‘I have just bought five pair of oxen, and I must go to examine them. Please
\add ask your master to\add* forgive me for not coming!’ 
\v 20 Another person said, ‘I have just been married. So I cannot come.’
\v 21 So the servant returned to his master and reported what \add everyone had
said\add*. The owner of the house was angry \add because the reasons they gave for
not\add* coming were ridiculous. He said to his servant, ‘Go out quickly to the streets and alleys of the city
\add and find\add* poor and crippled and blind and lame \add people, and
bring\add* them here into \add my house\add*!’ 
\v 22  \add After the servant went and did that\add*, he \add came back
and\add* said, ‘Sir, I have done what you\add (sg)\add* told me to do, but there is still room
\add for more people\add*.’ 
\v 23  \add So\add* his master said to him, ‘Then go \add outside the
city\add*. Search for people along the highways. Search also along the narrow roads with hedges beside them
\add where homeless people may be staying\add*. Strongly urge the people in those places to come to
\add my house\add*. I want it to be full of\add people\add*!’” 
\v 24  \add Then Jesus said\add*, “I tell you\add (pl)\add* this: Very few of you
\add Jewish\add* people will enjoy my feast, even though \add I\add* invited you
\add first to eat it with me when I become king\add*.” 
\s Luke 14:25-33 
\s Jesus warned that it would be difficult to be his disciple. 
\p
\v 25 Large groups of people were traveling with \add Jesus\add*. He turned and said to them,
\v 26 “If anyone comes to me who loves his father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters
\add more than\add* [HYP] \add he loves me\add*, he cannot be my disciple. He must even love me more than he loves his own
life! 
\v 27  \add People who are ready to execute a prisoner make\add* him carry his cross [MET]
\add to the place where others will nail him\add* on it. Only those who are willing
\add to allow others to hurt them and disgrace them\add* like that because of being my disciples, and who are willing to obey
what I teach, can be my disciples. 
\v 28  \add I will illustrate\add* [MET]. If one of you desired to build a ◄tower/big house►, ◄you would surely first sit down
and determine how much it would cost!/would you not first sit down and determine how much it would cost?► [RHQ] Then you would
determine whether you had enough money to complete it. 
\v 29  \add If you did not do that\add*, if you laid the foundation and were not able to finish
\add the rest of the tower\add*, everyone who saw it would make fun of you.
\v 30 They would say, ‘This man started to build \add a tower\add*, but he was not able to finish it!’
\v 31 Or, if a king decided to \add send his army to\add* war against another king, ◄he would surely first sit down
\add with those who\add* advised \add him\add*./would he not first sit down
\add with those who\add* advised \add him\add*?► [RHQ] They would determine whether
\add his army\add*, which had only ten thousand soldiers, could defeat the
\add other army\add*, which had twenty thousand soldiers, and was about to attack his
\add army\add*. 
\v 32 If he \add decided\add* that his army could not \add defeat that
army\add*, he would send messengers to \add the other king\add* while the other army was still far away. He would tell the
messengers to say to that king, ‘What things must I do to have peace with your country?’
\v 33 So, similarly, if any one of you does not first decide that
you\add (sg)\add* are \add willing to\add* give up all that you have, you cannot be my disciple.”
\s Luke 14:34-35 
\s Jesus warned about losing our usefulness to God. 
\p
\v 34  \add Jesus also said, “You are like\add* [MET] salt, which is useful
\add to put on food\add*. But ◄salt certainly cannot be made {\add you\add* certainly cannot make salt} to taste salty again if
it stops tasting salty!/can salt be made {can \add you\add* make salt} to taste salty again if it quits tasting salty?► [RHQ]
\v 35  \add If salt does not taste salty anymore\add*, it is not good for the soil or even for the manure heap.
\add People\add* throw it away. \add The same thing will happen to you if you become useless to
God\add*. If you want to understand what I just said [IDM], you must consider
\add carefully\add* what you have heard!”
