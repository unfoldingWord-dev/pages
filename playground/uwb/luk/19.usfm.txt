\c 19  
\s Luke 19:1-10 
\s Zacchaeus changed his way of life after talking with Jesus. 
\p
\v 1 They entered Jericho and were going through the \add city\add*.
\v 2 There was a man \add there\add* named Zacchaeus. He was a chief tax collector, who was rich.
\v 3 He tried to see Jesus, but he was very short and there was a big crowd of people
\add near Jesus\add*. So he was not able to see him. 
\v 4 So he ran further ahead \add along the road\add* that Jesus was walking on. He climbed a sycamore-fig tree to see Jesus.
\v 5 When Jesus got there, he looked up and said to him, “Zacchaeus, come down quickly, because
\add God wants\add* me to go \add with you(sg)\add* to your house and stay there
\add tonight!\add*” 
\v 6 So he came down quickly. \add He took Jesus to his house\add* and welcomed him joyfully.
\v 7 The people \add who saw Jesus go there\add* grumbled saying, “He has gone to be the guest of a man who is a sinner!”
\v 8 Then Zacchaeus stood up \add while they were eating\add* and said to the Lord
\add Jesus\add*, “Lord, I want you\add (sg)\add* to know that I am going to give half of what I own to poor people. And as for
the people whom I have cheated, I will pay them back four times the amount
\add I have gotten from them by cheating\add*.” 
\v 9 Jesus said to him, “Today \add God\add* has forgiven [PRS] \add you and the other people
in\add* [MTY] this house, because you\add (sg)\add* also \add have shown that you have trusted in God
as\add* your ancestor Abraham \add did\add*. 
\v 10 Remember this: \add I\add*, the one who came from heaven, came to seek and save
\add people like you(sg)\add* who have \add gone astray from God, just like a shepherd who searches for
his\add* lost \add sheep\add*.” 
\s Luke 19:11-27 (Mt. 25:14-30) 
\s Jesus taught about being willing to take risks in using what he has given us.
\p
\v 11 They were coming near to Jerusalem, and the people who were
\add going with Jesus\add* who heard him say these things thought that as soon as
\add he got to Jerusalem\add* he would become their king. 
\v 12  \add So\add* he told them this parable: “A prince prepared to go to a distant country in order that
\add the Emperor\add* would make him a king. \add He intended\add* to return later.
\v 13  \add Before he left\add*, he summoned ten of his servants. He gave each of them a coin worth three months' wages. He
said to them, ‘Do business with these coins until I return!’ \add Then he
left\add*. 
\v 14 But \add many of\add* his fellow-citizens hated him. So they sent some messengers after him to tell
\add the Emperor\add*, ‘We\add (exc)\add* do not want this man to be our king!’
\v 15 But \add the Emperor\add* made him king anyway. \add Later\add* the
\add new king\add* returned. Then he commanded that the servants to whom he had given the coins should be summoned {that
someone should summon the servants to whom he had given the coins}. He wanted to know how much they had gained by doing
business with the coins. 
\v 16 The first man came \add to him\add* and said, ‘Sir, with your one coin
\add I\add* have earned ten more \add coins\add*!’ 
\v 17 He said to this man, ‘\add You are a\add* good servant! \add You
have\add* done \add very\add* well! Because you have \add handled\add* faithfully a small amount
\add of money, I will give you\add* authority \add to rule\add* ten cities.’
\v 18 Then the second servant came and said, ‘Sir, with your one coin
\add I\add* have earned five more \add coins\add*!’ 
\v 19 He said to that servant similarly, ‘\add Good! I will give you authority to
rule\add* five cities.’ 
\v 20 Then another servant came. He said, ‘Sir, here is your coin. I wrapped it in a napkin and put it away,
\add so that nothing would happen to it\add*. 
\v 21 I did that \add because\add* I was afraid \add of what you would do to me if the business failed. I
know\add* you are a man who does not do foolish things with your money. You
\add even\add* take \add from others money\add* that does not really belong to
you\add , like a farmer who\add* harvests grain \add from another man's
field\add* where he did not\add even\add* do the planting.’ 
\v 22 He said to that servant, ‘You wicked servant! I will condemn you by the very words [MTY] that you
\add have just now spoken\add*! ◄You know that I do not \add do foolish things with my
money\add*./Did you not know that I do not \add do foolish things with my
money\add*?► [RHQ] \add You said\add* that I \add even\add* take
\add from others money\add* that does not really \add belong to me\add*,
\add like a farmer who\add* harvests grain \add from another man's
field\add* where he did not\add even\add* do the planting. 
\v 23 So ◄you should at least have given my money to money lenders!/why did you not
\add at least\add* give my money to bankers?► [RHQ] Then \add when I
returned\add* I could have collected that amount plus the interest
\add it would have earned!\add*’ 
\v 24 Then \add the king\add* said to those who were standing near, ‘Take the coin from him and give it to
\add the servant\add* who has ten coins!’ 
\v 25 They protested, ‘But Sir, he already has ten \add coins\add*!’
\v 26  \add But the king said\add*, ‘I tell you this: To the people who
\add use well what\add* they have \add received\add*, more will be given
{\add I\add* will give more}. But from the people who \add do\add* not
\add use well what they have received\add*, even what they \add already\add* have will be taken away
{\add I\add* will take away even what they already have}. 
\v 27 Now, \add as for\add* those enemies of mine who did not want me to rule over them, bring them here and execute them while
I am watching!’” 
\s Luke 19:28-40 (Mt. 21:1-9; Mk. 11:1-10; Jn. 12:12-15) 
\s Jesus entered Jerusalem humbly, but like a king. 
\p
\v 28 After \add Jesus\add* said those things, he \add continued on the
road\add* up to Jerusalem, going ahead of the disciples. 
\v 29 When they got near Bethphage and Bethany \add villages\add*, near the hill that is called {that they call} Olive
\add Tree\add* Hill, 
\v 30 he said to two of \add his\add* disciples, “Go to the village just ahead
\add of you\add*. As you \add two\add* enter \add it\add*, you will see a young animal that no one has ever ridden that has
been {someone has} tied up. Untie it and bring it \add to me\add*.
\v 31 If anyone asks you, ‘Why are you untying it?’ say \add to him\add*, ‘The Lord needs it.’”
\v 32  \add So\add* the \add two disciples\add* went \add to the
village\add* and found the \add animal\add*, just like he had told them.
\v 33 As they were untying it, its owners said to them, “Why are you two untying that young animal?”
\v 34 They replied, “The Lord needs it.” \add So the owners said that they could take
it\add*. 
\v 35 The \add two disciples\add* brought \add the animal\add* to Jesus. They threw their cloaks on the animal's back
\add for him to sit on\add* and helped Jesus get on it. 
\v 36 Then as he rode along, \add others\add* spread their cloaks on the road
\add to honor him\add*. 
\v 37 As they came near \add to Jerusalem\add*, on the road that descends from Olive
\add Tree\add* Hill, the whole crowd of his disciples began to rejoice and praise God loudly for all the great miracles that
they had seen \add Jesus do\add*. 
\v 38 They were saying things like, “May the Lord\add God\add* bless our king who comes representing [MTY] him!” “May there be
peace \add between God\add* in heaven \add and us his people\add*!” “May
\add everyone\add* praise God!” 
\v 39 Some of the Pharisees who were in the crowd said to him, “Teacher, rebuke your disciples
\add for saying things like that!\add*” 
\v 40 He replied, “I tell you this: If these people would be silent, the stones themselves would shout
\add to praise me!\add*” 
\s Luke 19:41-44 
\s Jesus prophesied that Jerusalem would be destroyed. 
\p
\v 41 When \add Jesus\add* came near \add to\add* Jerusalem and saw the city, he cried about
\add its people\add*. 
\v 42 He said, “\add My disciples know what they need to do\add* to have peace
\add with God\add*; I wish that even today \add the rest of\add* you people knew it. But now you are unable to know [MTY] it.
\v 43 I want you to know this: Soon \add your enemies\add* will come and will set up a barricade around your
\add city\add*. They will surround \add the city\add* and attack
\add it\add* on all sides. 
\v 44 They will \add break through\add* the walls \add and\add* destroy everything. They will smash you and your
people/children. \add When they finish destroying everything\add*, there will not be one stone left on top of another.
\add All this will happen\add* because you did not recognize the time when God sent his
\add Messiah\add* to \add save\add* you!” 
\s Luke 19:45-48 
\s Jesus expelled the merchants from the Temple courtyard and taught there.
\p
\v 45  \add Jesus entered Jerusalem and\add* went into the Temple
\add courtyard\add*. He saw in that place the people who were selling
\add things\add*, 
\v 46 and he began to chase them out. He said to them, “It has been written
{\add A prophet\add* wrote} \add in the Scriptures that God said\add*,
‘\add I want\add* my house to be a place where people pray’; but you bandits have made it a cave where you can
\add hide\add*!” 
\p
\v 47 Each day \add during that week Jesus\add* was teaching people in the Temple
\add courtyard\add*. The chief priests and the men who taught the
\add Jewish\add* laws and \add other Jewish\add* leaders tried to find a way to kill him.
\v 48 But they did not find any way to do it, because all the people there listened eagerly to him
\add and would have resisted them if they had tried to hurt him\add*.
