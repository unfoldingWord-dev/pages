\s Luke 24:1-12 
\s Some women discovered that Jesus had become alive again. 
\p
\v 1 Before dawn on Sunday those women went to the tomb. They took with them the spices that they had prepared
\add to put on Jesus' body\add*. 
\v 2 They discovered that the stone had been rolled away from \add the entrance
to\add* the tomb. 
\v 3 They went in the tomb, but the body of the Lord Jesus was not there!
\v 4 They did not know what to think about that. Then suddenly two men stood by them wearing bright shining clothes!
\v 5 The \add women\add* were frightened. As they prostrated themselves on the ground, the two men said to them, “◄You should
not be seeking someone who is alive in \add a place where they bury\add* dead people!/Why are you seeking in
\add a place where they bury\add* dead people someone who is alive?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*
\v 6 He is not here; he has ◄become alive again/risen from the dead►! Remember that while he was still with you in Galilee
\add district\add* he said to you, 
\v 7 ‘\add Even though I\add* am the one who came from heaven, \add someone\add* will enable sinful men to seize \f + \fr metonymy \f* me. They
will \add kill me by\add* nailing me to a cross. But on the third day
\add after that\add*, I will become alive \add again\add*.’” 
\v 8 The \add women\add* remembered that he had said that. 
\v 9 So they left the tomb and went to the eleven \add apostles\add* and his other
\add disciples\add* and told them those things. 
\v 10 The ones who kept telling those things to the apostles were Mary from Magdala
\add village\add*, Joanna, Mary who was the mother of James, and the other women
\add who were\add* with them. 
\v 11 But they thought that what the women \add said\add* was nonsense. They did not believe what the women said.
\v 12 But Peter got up and ran to the tomb \add anyway\add*. He stooped down
\add and looked inside\add*. He saw the linen cloths \add in which Jesus' body had been
wrapped\add*. \add The cloths were\add* by themselves \f + \fr (OR, \add He did not
see\add* anything else). So, wondering what had happened, he went to where he was staying.
\s Luke 24:13-35 
\s Jesus appeared to two disciples as they were walking to Emmaus.
\p
\v 13 That same day two of \add Jesus' disciples\add* were walking to a village named Emmaus. It was about ◄seven miles/eleven
kilometers► from Jerusalem. 
\v 14 They were talking with each other about all the things that had happened
\add to Jesus\add*. 
\v 15 While they were talking and discussing those things, Jesus himself approached them and started walking with them.
\v 16 But they were prevented {\add something\add* prevented them} from recognizing \f + \fr metonymy \f* him.
\v 17  \add Jesus\add* said to them, “What have you two been talking about while you were walking?” They stopped, and their
faces looked very sad. 
\v 18 One of them, whose name was Cleopas, said, “◄You\add (sg)\add* must be the only person who is visiting Jerusalem
\add for the Passover festival\add* who does not know the events that have happened there in recent days!/Are you the only
person who is visiting Jerusalem \add for the Passover festival\add* who does not know the events that have happened there in
recent days?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*” 
\v 19 He said to them, “What events?” They replied, “\add The things that
happened\add* to Jesus, \add the man\add* from Nazareth, who was a prophet. Many people saw him
\add perform\add* great miracles, and God\add enabled him\add* to teach wonderful
\add messages!\add* 
\v 20 But our chief priests and leaders handed him over \add to the Roman authorities. The
authorities\add* sentenced him to die, and they killed him by nailing him to a cross.
\v 21 We\add (exc)\add* were hoping that he was the one who would free
\add us\add* Israelites \add from our enemies\add*! But \add this does not seem possible now,
because\add* three days have \add already\add* passed since that happened.
\v 22 On the other hand, some women from our group amazed us. Early this morning they went to the tomb,
\v 23 but Jesus' body was not there! They came \add back\add* and said that they had seen some angels in a vision. The angels
said that he was alive! 
\v 24 Then some of those who were with us went to the tomb. They saw that things were exactly as the women had reported. But
they did not see \add Jesus\add*.” 
\v 25 He said to them, “\add You two\add* foolish \add men\add*!
\add You are so\add* slow to believe all that the prophets have written
\add about the Messiah!\add* 
\v 26 ◄\add You should certainly have known that\add* it was necessary that the Messiah should suffer all those things
\add and die\add*, and then enter his glorious \add home in heaven\add*!/Was it not necessary that the Messiah should suffer
all those things \add and die\add*, and then enter his glorious \add home in
heaven\add*?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*” 
\v 27 Then he explained to them all the things that \add the prophets\add* had written in the Scriptures about himself. He
started with what Moses \f + \fr metonymy \f* \add wrote\add* and then explained to them what all the
\add other\add* prophets \add wrote\add*. 
\p
\v 28 They came near to the village to \add which the two men\add* were going. He indicated that he would go further,
\v 29 but they urged him \add to not do that\add*. They said, “Stay with us
\add tonight\add*, because it is late in the afternoon and it will soon be dark.” So he went in
\add the house\add* to stay with them. 
\v 30 When they sat down to eat, he took some bread and \add asked God
to\add* bless it. He broke it and gave \add some pieces\add* to them.
\v 31 And then \add God\add* enabled them to recognize \f + \fr metonymy \f* him. But
\add immediately\add* he disappeared! 
\v 32 They said to each other, “\add While we were walking\add* along the road and he talked with us and
\add enabled\add* us\add (exc)\add* to understand the Scriptures, we
\add became so excited that it was as though\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f* a fire was burning within us \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*!
\add We should not stay here; we should go tell others what happened!\add*”
\v 33 So they left immediately and returned to Jerusalem. There they found the eleven
\add apostles\add* and others who had gathered together with them.
\v 34 They told \add those two men\add*, “It is true that the Lord has become alive again, and he has appeared to Simon/Peter!”
\v 35 Then those two \add men\add* told \add the others\add* what had happened
\add as they were walking\add* along the road. They also \add told them
how\add* they both recognized him as he broke some bread \add for
them\add*. 
\s Luke 24:36-49 
\s Jesus appeared to many of his disciples and taught them more and gave them other instructions.
\p
\v 36 As they were saying that, Jesus himself \add suddenly\add* appeared among them. He said to them,
“\add May God give\add* you \add inner\add* peace!” 
\v 37 They were startled and afraid, \add because\add* they thought that they were seeing a ghost!
\v 38 He said to them, “◄You should not be alarmed!/Why are you alarmed?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* And ◄you should not be doubting
\add that I am alive\add*/Jesus!/why are you doubting \add that I am
alive\add*/Jesus?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* 
\v 39 Look at \add the wounds in\add* my hands and my feet! You can touch me and see
\add my body\add*. Then you can see that it is really I myself. \add You can tell that I am really
alive\add* because ghosts do not have bodies, as you see that I have!”
\v 40 After he said that, he showed them \add the wounds in\add* his hands and his feet.
\v 41 They were joyful and amazed, \add but\add* they still did not believe
\add that he was really alive\add* (OR, \add that he was the one that they were
seeing\add*) \f*. \add So\add* he said to them, “Do you have anything here to eat?”
\v 42  \add So\add* they gave him a piece of broiled fish. 
\v 43 While they were watching, he took it and ate it. 
\p
\v 44 Then he said to them, “\add I will repeat\add* what I told you while I was still with you: Everything that was written
about me by Moses and the \add other\add* prophets \f + \fr metonymy \f* and in the Psalms must be fulfilled!”
\v 45 Then he enabled them to understand \add the things that had been written about him
in\add* the Scriptures. 
\v 46 He said to them, “This is what they wrote: That the Messiah would suffer
\add and die\add*, but on the third day after that he would become alive again.
\v 47  \add They\add* also \add wrote that the message\add* must be preached
{\add that his followers\add* must preach \add the message\add*}
\add everywhere that people\add* must turn from their sinful ways for
\add God\add* to forgive their sins. \add They wrote that his followers should preach that message,
claiming\add* his authority \f + \fr metonymy \f*. They wrote that they should start
\add preaching\add* it in Jerusalem and then \add go and\add* preach it to all ethnic groups.
\v 48 You \add apostles\add* must tell people that you know that those things
\add that happened to me\add* are true. 
\v 49 And I want you to know that I will send the \add Holy Spirit\add* \f + \fr metonymy \f* to you, as my Father promised that
\add he would do\add*. But you must stay in this city until God fills you with the power
\add of his Spirit\add*.” 
\s Luke 24:50-53 
\s Jesus left his disciples and returned to heaven. 
\p
\v 50 Then \add Jesus\add* led them outside \add the city\add* until they came near Bethany
\add village\add*. There he lifted up his hands and blessed them.
\v 51 As he was doing that, he left them \add and went up to heaven\add*.
\v 52 They worshipped him. And then they returned to Jerusalem very joyfully.
\v 53 Each day \f + \fr synecdoche \f* they went into the Temple \add courtyard\add*, and spent a lot of time praising God.
