\s Luke 23:1-5 
\s They accused Jesus before Pilate, the Roman governor. 
\p
\v 1 Then the whole group got up and took him to Pilate, \add the Roman
governor\add*. 
\v 2 They began to accuse him, saying, “We\add (exc)\add* have determined that this fellow has caused political trouble in our
country. He has been \add telling people that they should\add* not pay taxes to the Roman government \f + \fk metonymy \f*. Also, he says that
he is the Messiah, a king!” 
\v 3 Pilate asked him, “Do you\add (sg) claim that you are\add* the King of the Jews?” He replied,
“\add It is\add* as you have \add just\add* now said.” 
\v 4 Pilate said to the chief priests and \add the rest of\add* the crowd, “I do not conclude that this man is guilty of any
crime.” 
\v 5 But they kept insisting, saying, “He is inciting the people
\add to riot!\add* He has been teaching his \add ideas\add* throughout all of Judea
\add district\add*. He started \add doing it\add* in Galilee \add district\add* and now he is doing it here!”
\s Luke 23:6-12 
\s After Pilate sent Jesus to Herod, Jesus refused to answer Herod's questions.
\p
\v 6 When Pilate heard that, he asked, “Is this man from Galilee
\add district\add*?” 
\v 7 When they told him that Jesus was \add from Galilee, which was the
district\add* that Herod \add Antipas\add* ruled, \add he told them\add* to take Jesus to Herod
\add Antipas\add*, because Herod was in Jerusalem at that time. 
\v 8  \add So they did\add*. When Herod saw Jesus, he was very happy. He
\add had heard about Jesus\add*, and he had been hoping for a long time that he could see Jesus perform a miracle.
\v 9 So he asked Jesus many questions, but Jesus did not reply \add to any of
them\add*. 
\v 10 The chief priests and men who taught the \add Jewish\add* laws stood near him, accusing him very strongly.
\v 11 Then Herod and his soldiers ◄made fun of/ridiculed► \add Jesus\add*. They put gorgeous clothes on him
\add to mock him as being a king\add*. Then Herod sent him back to Pilate.
\v 12 Until that time Herod and Pilate had been very hostile to each other, but that very day they became friends.
\s Luke 23:13-25 
\s Pilate was unsuccessful in his efforts to set Jesus free. 
\p
\v 13 Pilate then gathered together the chief priests and other \add Jewish\add* leaders and the crowd
\add that was still there\add*. 
\v 14 He said to them, “You brought this man to me, saying that he had caused trouble among the people. But
\add I want you to know that\add* after having examined him while you were listening, I do not conclude that he is guilty of
any of the things that you are accusing him about. 
\v 15  \add Obviously\add* Herod did not \add conclude that\add* either, because he sent him back to me
\add without punishing him\add*. \add So it\add* is clear that this man has not done anything for which
we\add (inc)\add* should kill him. 
\v 16-17 So I will \add have my soldiers\add* whip him and then release
him.”\f + Pilate had to release one prisoner for the people during the Passover festival each
year.”\f* 
\v 18 But the whole crowd shouted, “Execute this man! Release Barrabas for
us\add (exc)\add*!” 
\v 19 Barrabas was a man who had tried to persuade people in the city to rebel
\add against the Roman government. While doing that\add*, he had murdered
\add someone\add*. So he had been put {they had put him} in prison,
\add where he was waiting for them to execute him\add*. 
\v 20 Because Pilate wanted to release Jesus, he tried to persuade the crowd again.
\v 21 But they kept shouting, “\add Command your soldiers to\add* kill him by nailing him to a cross!” Have him crucified!”
\v 22 He \add spoke to them\add* a third time and asked them, “Why? What crime has he committed? I have concluded that he has
done nothing for which he deserves to die. So I will \add have my
soldiers\add* whip him and then release him.” 
\v 23 But they kept insisting. They shouted loudly that \add Jesus\add* should be nailed {that
\add Pilate\add* should \add have his soldiers\add* nail \add Jesus\add*} to a cross. Finally, because they continued to shout
\f + \fk personification \f* \add so loudly\add*, 
\v 24 Pilate decided to do what they requested. 
\v 25 The man who had been {whom they had} put in prison because he had rebelled
\add against the government\add* and who had murdered \add someone\add*, he released! That was the man whom the crowd had asked
him \add to release\add*. He put Jesus into the hands \add of the
soldiers\add*, to do what \add the crowd\add* wanted. 
\s Luke 23:26-31 
\s The soldiers nailed Jesus to a cross. 
\p
\v 26 As the soldiers were taking \add Jesus\add* away, they seized a man named Simon,
\add who was\add* from Cyrene \add city in Africa\add*. He was returning
\add to Jerusalem\add* from out in the countryside. They \add took from Jesus the cross that he had been carrying.
Then\add* they put it on Simon's shoulders, and \add told him to\add* carry it behind Jesus.
\v 27 A large crowd followed Jesus. The crowd included many women who were beating their breasts
\add to show how sad they were\add*, and wailing for him. 
\v 28 But Jesus turned to them and said, “You women of Jerusalem, do not cry for me! Instead, cry because of
\add what is going to happen to\add* yourselves and your children!
\v 29 I want you to know that there will soon be a time when people will say, ‘Women \f + \fk synecdoche \f* who have never borne children or
nursed babies are fortunate!’ 
\v 30 Then, \add in order that they will not have to suffer greatly when their enemies destroy this
city\add*, people who are left in the city will say to the mountains, ‘Fall down on us!’ And people will say to the hills,
‘Cover us!’ 
\v 31  \add I am innocent\add* \f + \fk metaphor \f*. \add I am like\add* a living tree
\add that people do not try to burn. But the people of Jerusalem deserve that their enemies punish them. They are
like\add* dry wood that is ready to \add burn\add*. So if they \add nail me to the
cross\add*, ◄\add their enemies\add* will certainly do much worse things to them!/what worse things will God do to them?►
\f + \fk rhetorical question \f*” 
\s Luke 23:32-49 
\s The things that happened when Jesus died. 
\p
\v 32 Two other men who were criminals were also being led away {\add The
soldiers\add* also led away two other men who were criminals}. They were going to be executed
{\add The soldiers\add* were going to execute them} \add with Jesus\add*.
\v 33 When they came to the place which is called ‘The Skull’, they nailed
\add Jesus\add* to a cross\add after removing his clothes\add*. They did the same thing to the two criminals. They put one at
the right \add side of Jesus\add* and one at his left \add side\add*.
\v 34 Jesus said, “\add My\add* Father, forgive them, because they do not realize
\add whom\add* they are doing \add this to\add*.” Then \add the soldiers\add* divided his clothing by gambling with something
like dice, \add to decide which piece of clothing each one would
get\add*. 
\v 35 Many people stood nearby, watching. And the \add Jewish\add* leaders ◄made fun of/ridiculed►
\add Jesus\add*, saying, “He \add said\add* \f + \fk irony \f* \add that he\add* saved other people! If he is the Messiah, the one God has
chosen, he should save himself!” 
\v 36 The soldiers also ridiculed him because he \add claimed to be a
king\add*. They came up to him and offered him some sour wine. 
\v 37 They said to him, “If you\add (sg)\add* are the King of the Jews, save yourself!”
\v 38  \add They\add* also \add fastened on the cross\add* above his head a sign
\add that stated\add* why \add they\add* were nailing him to the cross.
\add But all it said was\add*, ‘This is the King of the Jews’. 
\p
\v 39 One of the criminals who was hanging \add on a cross\add* began to insult him, saying,
“You\add (sg) said that you\add* are the Messiah, so \add you must be
powerful!\add* So save yourself, and save us, too!” 
\v 40 But the other \add criminal\add* rebuked him, saying, “◄You\add (sg)\add* should be afraid of God
\add punishing you\add*!/Are you not afraid of God \add punishing
you\add*?► \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* They are punishing him \add and us\add* similarly.
\v 41 They have justly decided that we\add (inc) two\add* must die. They are punishing us as we deserve
\add for the evil things that we did\add*. But this man has done nothing wrong!”
\v 42 Then he said, “Jesus, \add please\add* remember me \add and take care of
me\add* when you become king!” 
\v 43 Jesus replied, “I want you\add (sg)\add* to know that today
you\add (sg)\add* will be with me in the place where everyone is happy!” \f + \ft (OR, that today you will be with me in Paradise!) \f*
\p
\v 44  \add Then it\add* was about noontime. It became dark over the whole land,
\add and it stayed dark\add* until three o'clock in the afternoon.
\v 45 There was no light from the sun. Then the \add thick\add* curtain
\add that closed off the most holy place\add* in the Temple split into two pieces.
\add That signified that ordinary people could now go into the presence of
God\add*. 
\v 46  \add As that happened\add*, Jesus shouted loudly, “Father, I put my spirit into your care \f + \fk metonymy \f*!” When he said that, he
stopped breathing \f + \fk euphemism \f* \add and died\add*. 
\p
\v 47 When the officer \add who supervised the soldiers who were executing
Jesus\add* saw what happened, he praised God \add for the way Jesus
died\add*, saying, “\add I am\add* sure that this man had done nothing wrong!”
\v 48 When the crowd of people who had gathered to see those events saw what happened, they returned
\add to their homes\add*, beating their breasts \add to show that they were
sorrowful\add*. 
\v 49 All of Jesus' friends, including the women who had come with him from Galilee
\add district\add*, stood at a distance and saw all that happened.
\s Luke 23:50-56 
\s Joseph and others buried Jesus while some women watched. 
\p
\v 50 There was a man named Joseph who \add came there\add*. He was from the town of Arimathea in Judea. He was a good and a
righteous man, and he was a member of the \add Jewish\add* Council.
\v 51 But he had not agreed with the other Council \add members\add* when they decided
\add to kill Jesus\add* and when they \add planned how to\add* do it. He was waiting expectantly for
\add the time when\add* God \add would send\add* his king to begin to rule.
\v 52 He went to Pilate and asked \add Pilate to permit him\add* to
\add take\add* Jesus' body \add and bury it. After Pilate allowed him to do
that\add*, 
\v 53 he \add and some others\add* took \add Jesus' body\add* down
\add from the cross\add*. They wrapped it in a linen cloth. Then they put his body in a tomb that he had
\add hired others to\add* dig out of a rock \add cliff\add*. No one had ever put a body in it before.
\v 54  \add They had to do it quickly because\add* that was \add Friday\add*, the day when
\add people\add* prepared \add things for the Jewish day of rest\add*. ◄The Sabbath/The day of rest► was about to start
\add at sunset, so they had to finish burying his body before sunset\add*.
\v 55 The women who had come with \add Jesus\add* from Galilee \add district\add* followed
\add Joseph and the men who were with him\add*. They saw the tomb, and they saw how the men laid
\add Jesus'\add* body \add inside it, and saw the men roll a huge stone across the
entrance\add*. 
\v 56 Then the women returned to the houses \add where they were staying. The following
evening\add* they prepared spices and ointments to put \add on Jesus'
body\add*, but ◄on the Sabbath/on the Jewish rest day► they rested, according to what
\add Moses\add* had commanded.
