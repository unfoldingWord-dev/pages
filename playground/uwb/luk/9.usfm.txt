\c 9  
\s Luke 9:1-6 
\s Jesus sent out his apostles to teach and heal people. 
\p
\v 1  \add One day\add* Jesus summoned his twelve \add apostles\add*, and gave them power to expel all
\add kinds of\add* demons and to heal \add people with\add* diseases. He gave them authority to do that.
\v 2  \add Before\add* he sent them out to heal people and to tell people
\add what it meant to let\add* God rule\f + \ft Or: have complete control \add over\add* \f*
\add their lives\add*, 
\v 3 he said to them, “Do not take things for your journey. Do not take a walking stick or a
\add traveler's\add* bag or food or money. Do not take an extra shirt\f + \ft Or: extra clothes \f*.
\v 4 Whenever you enter some house \add to lodge there\add*, stay in that house until you leave that town.
\v 5  \add In towns\add* where the people do not welcome you, \add you should not continue to stay there.
Just\add* leave those towns. And as you leave, shake off the dust from your feet.
\add Do that to\add* warn them\add that God will punish them for rejecting your
message\add*.” 
\v 6 Then they left and traveled through many villages. Everywhere
\add they went\add*, they told people God's good message and healed sick people.
\s Luke 9:7-11 
\s Herod was uncertain about who was doing these miracles. 
\p
\v 7 Herod \add Antipas\add*, the ruler of \add that\add* district, heard about the things that
\add Jesus and his disciples\add* were doing. \add He had previously commanded his soldiers to execute John the Baptizer, so
now\add* he was perplexed, because some people were saying that John had become alive again
\add and was doing those miracles\add*. 
\v 8 Others were saying that \add the prophet\add* Elijah had appeared
\add again as had been prophesied\add*. Others were saying that one of the
\add other\add* former prophets had become alive again \add and was doing those
miracles\add*. 
\v 9 But Herod said, “\add It cannot be John who is doing these things\add*,
\add because\add* I \add commanded my soldiers to\add* cut off his head. So who is
\add this man\add* that I am hearing these things about?” And he kept wanting to see
\add Jesus\add*. 
\p
\v 10 When the apostles returned \add from traveling to various towns\add*, they told Jesus the things that they had done. Then
he took them and they went by themselves \add by boat\add* to a town called Bethsaida.
\v 11 But when the crowds \add of people who had been with Jesus\add* found out about that, they followed him
\add on land. When they got to where he was\add*, he welcomed them. He taught them about how God is going to some day rule as
king\f + \ft Or: have complete control \add over people's lives\add* \f*. He also healed the sick people.
\s Luke 9:12-17 
\s Jesus fed over 5,000 people miraculously. 
\p
\v 12 Late in the afternoon the twelve \add apostles\add* came to him and said, “This is a place where nobody lives, so dismiss
the people so that they can go to the surrounding villages and other places where they can get some food and find places to
stay.” 
\v 13 But he said to them, “\add No\add*, you \add yourselves\add* give them something to eat!” They replied,
“We\add (exc)\add* have only five small loaves and two \add cooked\add* fish. Are
you\add (sg)\add* going to \add give\add* us \add the money\add* to go somewhere and buy food for all these people?”
\v 14 There were about five thousand men \add there\add*. He replied to the disciples,
“\add No\add*, \add just\add* tell the people to sit down. Tell them to sit in groups, with about fifty people in each group.”
\v 15 After they told the people that, they all sat down. 
\v 16 Then he took the five small loaves and the two fish. He looked up towards heaven and thanked
\add God for them\add*. Then he broke them \add into pieces\add* and gave them to the disciples so that they would distribute
them to the crowd. 
\v 17 All \add the people in the crowd\add* ate until they all had enough to eat. Then
\add the disciples\add* collected twelve baskets full of the broken pieces that were left over!
\s Luke 9:18-27 
\s After Peter expressed his belief that Jesus is the Messiah, Jesus predicted his own death and resurrection.
\p
\v 18  \add One day\add* Jesus was praying in a place where only the disciples were with him. He asked them, “The crowds
\add of people\add*, who do they say that I \add really\add* am?”
\v 19 They replied, “\add Some people say that you are\add* John the Baptizer,
\add who has come back to life again\add*. Others say that you are
\add the prophet\add* Elijah, \add who has returned from heaven as God
promised\add*. Others say that you are one of the \add other\add* prophets who lived long ago, who has come back to life
again.” 
\v 20 He asked them, “What about you\add (pl)\add*? Who do you say that I am?” Peter replied,
“You\add (sg)\add* are the Messiah, who \add has come from\add* God.”
\v 21 Then Jesus warned them strongly not to tell that to anyone
\add yet\add*. 
\v 22 Then he said, “\add Even though I am\add* the one who came from heaven, it is necessary that I suffer very much. It is
also necessary that I be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the men who teach
the\add Jewish\add* laws {that the \add Jewish\add* elders and the chief priests and the men who teach the
\add Jewish\add* laws will reject me}. It is necessary that I be killed {that
\add people\add* will kill me}. Then on the third day \add after
that\add*, I will become alive again.” 
\p
\v 23 Then he said to all of them, “If any one \add of you\add* wants to be my disciple, you must not do
\add only\add* what you yourself desire \add to do\add*. \add Specifically\add*, you must be willing each day \f + \ft metaphor \f*
\add to let others hurt you and disgrace you. That is like what is done to criminals who are
forced\add* to carry \f + \ft metaphor \f* crosses \add to the place where they will be
executed\add*. \add That is what anyone who wants to\add* be my disciple
\add must do\add*. 
\v 24 You must do that, because those who try to save their lives
\add by denying that they belong to me when people want to kill them for believing in
me\add* will not live \add eternally\add*, but those who are killed because of being my
\add disciples\add* will live \add forever with me\add*. 
\v 25 People might get everything that \add they want\add* in this world, but ◄they are really gaining nothing if they do not
get eternal life by \add becoming my disciples\add*!\f + \ft Or: are \f* they really gaining anything if they do not get eternal life by
\add becoming my disciples\add*?► \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* 
\v 26 Those who reject my message\add and\add* refuse to say that
\add they belong\add* to me, \add I\add*, the one who came from heaven, will also refuse to say that
\add they belong to me\add* when I come back with the holy angels, and have the glorious brightness that my Father has.
\v 27 But listen carefully! Some of you\add (pl)\add* who are here now will see God ruling \f + \ft metaphor \f*
\add in many powerful ways\add*. You will see it before you die!”
\s Luke 9:28-36 
\s Jesus talked with Moses and Elijah. 
\p
\v 28 About a week after \add Jesus\add* said those things, he took Peter, James, and
\add James' brother\add* John and led them up a mountain so that he could pray
\add there\add*. 
\v 29 As he was praying, his face appeared very different to them. His clothes became as bright as lightning.
\v 30-31 Suddenly, two men appeared who had the brightness \add of
heaven\add* surrounding them. They were \add prophets who had lived long
ago\add*, Moses and Elijah. They started talking with Jesus about how he
\add would accomplish what God had planned when he died\add* \f + \ft euphemism \f*
\add very soon\add* in Jerusalem. 
\v 32 Peter and the other \add disciples\add* who were with him were sound asleep. When they woke up, they saw
\add Jesus'\add* brightness. They also saw the two men standing with him.
\v 33 As \add Moses and Elijah\add* were starting to leave Jesus, Peter said to him, “Master, it is wonderful for us to be
here! Allow us to make three shelters, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah!” But he really did not realize what he
was saying. 
\v 34 As he was saying that, a \add bright\add* cloud appeared and covered them. The disciples were afraid as the cloud
surrounded them. 
\v 35  \add God\add* [MTY\f + \ft Or: EUP \f*] spoke to them from the cloud, saying, “This is my Son. He is the one whom
\add I\add* have chosen \add to do a great work for me\add*. \add So\add* you must listen to him!”
\v 36 After \add God\add* [MTY\f + \ft Or: EUP \f*] finished saying that, \add the three
disciples\add* saw that only Jesus was there. They did not tell anyone what they had seen until much later.
\s Luke 9:37-43a 
\s Jesus expelled a demon from a boy. 
\p
\v 37 The next day, after they had come down from the mountain, a large crowd
\add of people\add* met Jesus. 
\v 38 Then a man from the crowd exclaimed, “Teacher, I plead with you,
\add do something to help\add* my son! He is my only child! 
\v 39 At various times an evil spirit suddenly seizes him and \add causes\add* him to scream. The evil spirit shakes him
violently and causes him to foam at the mouth. It does not leave until my child is completely exhausted.
\v 40 I pleaded with your disciples \add who were here\add* for them to expel
\add the evil spirit\add*, but they were not able to do it!” 
\v 41 Jesus replied \add by saying to everyone who had gathered there\add*,
“\add You who have seen how I help people\add* do not believe \add that you can do
anything\add*! What you \add think\add* is perverted! How long must I be with you
\add before you are able to do what I do\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*? \add How long must
I\add* endure your \add lack of faith\add*?” \add Then he said to the boy's
father\add*, “Bring your\add (sg)\add* son here \add to me\add*!”
\v 42 While they were bringing the boy to Jesus, the demon attacked the boy, threw him to the ground, and shook him severely.
But Jesus rebuked the evil spirit and healed the boy. Then he returned him to his father's
\add care\add*. 
\v 43 All the people \add there\add* were amazed at the great \add power\add* of God.
\s Luke 9:43b-45 
\s Jesus predicted his arrest. 
\p While they were all amazed at all the miracles \add Jesus\add* was doing, he said to his disciples,
\v 44 “Think carefully \f + \ft metonymy \f* about what I am about to tell you: \add Even though I
am\add* the one who came from heaven, \add I will soon\add* be handed over to the authorities \f + \ft Or: my enemies)
{\add someone\add* is about to enable \f + \ft metonymy \f* my enemies to seize me}.”
\v 45 But \add the disciples\add* did not understand what he was saying;
\add God\add* prevented them from understanding it, so that they would not know
\add yet\add* what he meant. And they were afraid to ask him about
\add what he had said\add*. 
\s Luke 9:46-48 
\s Jesus told his disciples who is really great in God's sight. 
\p
\v 46 The disciples began to argue among themselves about which one of them would be the greatest
\add when Jesus became king\add*. 
\v 47 But Jesus perceived what they were thinking. So he brought a young child to his side.
\v 48 He said to \add the disciples\add*, “Those who, because they\add love\add* me, (OR, because they want to behave like me)
welcome a little child \add like\add* this one\f + \ft Or: \add as\add* I \add would\add* \f*
\f + \ft metonymy \f*\add , God considers that\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* they are welcoming me. And those who welcome me,
\add God considers\add* that \f + \ft metaphor \f* they are welcoming him, the one who sent me. Remember that those among you who think of
themselves as being very unimportant will be the ones \add whom God
considers\add* to be great.” 
\s Luke 9:49-50 
\s Jesus told them not to forbid others from expelling demons. 
\p
\v 49 John replied to \add Jesus\add*, “Master, we\add (exc)\add* saw a man who was expelling demons,
\add claiming\add* that \add he had\add* authority from you \f + \ft metonymy \f* to do that. So we told him to stop doing it, because he is
not one of us \add disciples\add*.” 
\v 50 But Jesus said to him \add and the other disciples\add*, “Do not tell him not to
\add do that\add*! Remember that those who are not opposing you are trying to
\add achieve the same goals that\add* you are!” 
\s Luke 9:51-56 
\s People in a Samaritan town refused to welcome Jesus. 
\p
\v 51 When it was almost time for \add God\add* to take him up to heaven,
\add Jesus\add* firmly resolved to go to Jerusalem. 
\v 52 He sent some messengers to go ahead of him, and they entered a village in Samaria
\add district\add* to prepare for him \f + \ft synecdoche \f* \add to go there\add*.
\v 53 But \add the Samaritans did not like the Jews because of their insisting that it was necessary to go to Jerusalem to
worship God. So\add*, because Jesus had firmly resolved to go to Jerusalem, they would not let him come
\add to their village\add*. 
\v 54 When two of his disciples, James and John, heard about that, they said, “Lord, do
you\add (sg)\add* want us\add (exc)\add* to pray that \add God\add* will send fire down from heaven,
\add as the prophet Elijah did long ago\add*, and destroy those people?”
\v 55 But Jesus turned and rebuked them \add for saying that\add*.
\v 56 So they went to a different village. 
\s Luke 9:57-62 
\s Jesus told three people what it would cost them if they became his disciples.
\p
\v 57 As Jesus and the disciples were walking along the road, one man said to him, “I will go with
you\add (sg \f*\add* wherever you go!” 
\v 58  \add In order that the man might know what he could expect if he went with
him\add*, Jesus said to him, “Foxes have holes \add in the ground in which to
live\add*, and birds have nests, but \add even though I am\add* the one who came from heaven, I do not have a home where I can
sleep!” 
\v 59 Jesus told another man, “Come with me!” But the man said, “Lord\f + \ft Or: Sir \f*, let me go
\add home\add* first. \add After\add* my father \add dies\add* I will bury him,
\add and then I will come with you\add*.” 
\v 60 But Jesus said to him, “\add God considers that those who do not have eternal life
are\add* dead \f + \ft metaphor \f*. Let those people \add do the work of\add* burying people who die. As for you, go and tell people about how
God wants to rule\f + \ft Or: to have complete control \add over\add* \f* \add people's
lives\add*!” 
\v 61 Someone else said, “Lord, I will come with you and be your disciple, but first let me go home to say goodbye to my
relatives.” 
\v 62 Jesus said to him, “Anyone who is plowing his field should not look back
\add to see what he has done. He must look forward to what is ahead.
Similarly\add*, \add anyone who continues to be concerned about his family and other things he has left
behind\add* is not fit \add to serve me and tell others about how\add* God wants to rule \f + \ft metonymy \f*
\add people's lives\add*.”
