\c 17  
\s Luke 17:1-4 
\s Jesus warned about God punishing those who cause others to sin.
\p
\v 1  \add One day Jesus\add* said to his disciples, “Things that will tempt
\add people\add* to sin are certain to happen, but it will be terrible for anyone who causes them to happen!
\v 2 Suppose you caused one of these people who \add do not believe in me very
strongly\add* to sin. If a huge stone was fastened {someone fastened a huge stone} around your neck and you were thrown {and
threw you} into the sea, \add you would consider that a severe punishment, but God will
punish\add* you even more severely \add if you cause someone to sin!\add*
\v 3 Be careful \add how you act\add*. If you \add know about\add* a fellow believer who sins,
you\add (sg)\add* should rebuke him. If he \add says that he\add* is sorry for having sinned
\add and asks you to forgive him\add*, forgive him. 
\v 4 Even if he sins against you\add (sg)\add* seven times in one day, if he comes to you each time and says, ‘I am sorry for
what I did’, you must continue forgiving him.” 
\s Luke 17:5-6 
\s Jesus taught them what big things they could accomplish if they had true faith.
\p
\v 5  \add One day\add* the apostles said to the Lord, “Help us to trust
\add in you\add* \f + \ft (OR\add , in God\add*) more strongly!” 
\v 6 The Lord replied, “Mustard \add seeds are very small, but in this area they grow and produce
large\add* \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* \add plants\add*. \add Similarly\add*, if your faith grows until you truly believe that God
\add will do what you ask him to, you will be able to do anything\add*. You could
\add even\add* say to this mulberry tree, ‘Pull yourself out \add with your
roots\add* and plant yourself in the sea!’ and it would obey you!”
\s Luke 17:7-10 
\s Jesus taught that we should serve God faithfully without expecting to be thanked.
\p
\v 7  \add Jesus also said\add*, “Suppose that one of you had a servant who was plowing
\add your fields\add* or taking care of your sheep. After he comes into the house from the field,
you\add (sg)\add* would not say \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f*, ‘Sit down and eat immediately!’
\v 8 Instead, you would say to him, ‘Put on your apron and prepare a meal for me! Then serve it to me so that I can eat and
drink it! Afterwards you\add (sg)\add* can eat and drink.’ 
\v 9 ◄You will not thank your servant for doing the work that he had been told {you had told him} to do!\f + \ft Or: Would \f* you thank your
servant because he did the work that he had been told {you had told him} to do?► \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f*
\v 10 Similarly, when you\add (pl)\add* have done everything that
\add God\add* has told you to do, you should say, ‘We\add (inc)\add* are not worthy
\add of God thanking us\add* {\add being thanked\add*}. We are only God's servants. We have only done the things that he told
us to do.’” 
\s Luke 17:11-19 
\s Jesus healed ten lepers, but only a non-Jewish one thanked him.
\p
\v 11 As \add Jesus and his disciples\add* were walking along the road to Jerusalem, they were going through
\add the region\add* between Samaria and Galilee \add districts\add*.
\v 12 As they entered one village, ten lepers came near the road.
\add Because lepers were not permitted to come near other people\add*, they stood at some distance
\v 13 and called out, “Jesus, Master, pity us \add and heal us\add*!”
\v 14 When he saw them, he said \add to them\add*, “Each of you should go and show yourself to a priest
\add in Jerusalem so that he can see if you are healed\add*.” As they were going
\add there\add*, they were healed. 
\v 15 Then one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, praising God loudly.
\v 16 He \add came to Jesus\add*, prostrated himself at Jesus' feet, and thanked him. This man was a Samaritan,
\add not a Jew\add*. 
\v 17 Then Jesus said, “\add I\add* healed ten \add lepers\add*! ◄I am disappointed that the other nine did not come
back!\f + \ft Or: Where \f* are the other nine?► \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* 
\v 18 I am disappointed \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* that this non-Jewish man was the only one who returned to thank God; none of the others came back
to me!” 
\v 19 Then he said to the man, “Get up and continue on your journey.
\add God\add* \\f + \\ft personification \\f* \add has saved you and\add* healed you\add (sg)\add* because you trusted
\add in me\add*.” 
\s Luke 17:20-21 
\s Jesus taught that God's rule is within our lives. 
\p
\v 20  \add One day\add* Jesus was asked by \add some\add* Pharisees \\f + \\ft synecdoche \\f*
{\add some\add* Pharisees \\f + \\ft synecdoche \\f* asked \add Jesus\add*}, “When is God
\add going\add* to rule as king?” He replied, “God's ruling \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* is not something people will be able to see with their eyes.
\v 21 And people will not be able to say, ‘Look! He is \add ruling\add* here!’ Or ‘He is
\add ruling\add* there!’ because, \add contrary to what you think\add*, God's ruling is within people's inner beings (OR, is
already happening among you).” 
\s Luke 17:22-37 
\s Jesus told his disciples that without warning he would return and judge people.
\p
\v 22  \add Jesus\add* said to his disciples, “There will be a time when you will want to see
\add me\add* \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f*, the one who came from heaven, \add ruling powerfully\add*. But you will not see that.
\v 23  \add Some\add* people will say to you, ‘Look, \add the Messiah\add* is over there!’ or
\add they will say\add* ‘Look, he is here!’ When they say that, do not believe them. Do not follow them
\add to go see the Messiah\add*. 
\v 24 Because when the lightning flashes and lights up the sky from one side to the other,
\add everyone can see it. Similarly\add* \\f + \\ft simile \\f*, at the time \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* when
\add I\add*, the one who came from heaven, come back again, \add everyone will see
me\add*. 
\v 25 But before that happens, I must suffer in many ways (OR, very much). And I will be rejected by people {people will reject
me}, \add even though\add* they \add have observed me doing good for
people\add*. 
\v 26 But when \add I\add*, the one who came from heaven, \add come again,
people\add* will be doing things just like people were doing at the time when \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* Noah
\add lived\add*. 
\v 27  \add At that time\add* people ate and drank \add as usual\add*, and they got married
\add as usual\add*, up until the day when Noah \add and his family\add* entered the big boat. But then the flood came and
destroyed all those \add who were not in the boat\add*. 
\v 28 Similarly, when Lot \add lived in Sodom city, people there\add* ate and drank
\add as usual\add*. They bought things and they sold things. They planted
\add crops\add* and they built \add houses as usual\add*. 
\v 29 But on the day that Lot \add and his family\add* left Sodom, fire and
\add burning\add* sulfur came down from the sky and destroyed all those
\add who stayed in the city\add*. 
\v 30 Similarly, when \add I\add*, the one who came from heaven, return to earth
\add people will be unprepared\add* (OR, \add enjoying normal life\add*) \f*
\v 31 On that day, those who are outside their houses, with all the things that they own inside
\add the houses\add*, must not go \add inside\add* to take them away,
\add because there will not be enough time to do that\add*. Similarly, those who are working in a field must not turn back
\add to get anything\add*; \add they must flee quickly\add*. 
\v 32 Remember Lot's wife! \add Because she turned back and wanted to get some of her things from Sodom, she died immediately
and became a pillar of salt\add*. 
\v 33 Anyone who wants to hold onto his life \add and his possessions\add* will not
\add receive eternal\add* life. But anyone who is \add willing to\add* die
\add for my sake\add* will live \add eternally\add*. 
\v 34 I tell you this: On the night \add when I return\add*, there will be two people
\add sleeping\add* in one bed. The one \add who believes in me\add* will be taken
{\add God\add* will take the one \add who believes in me\add*} \add to
heaven\add*, and the other one will be left \add behind and punished\add* {and
\add he\add* will leave the other one \add behind and punish him\add*}.
\v 35-36 Two women will be grinding grain together; one will be taken and the other left
{\add God\add* will take one and leave the other} \add behind\add*.”
\v 37  \add His disciples\add* said to him, “Lord, where \add will this
happen\add*?” He replied to them, “Wherever there is an animal carcass, the vultures will gather
\add to eat it\add* \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f*. \add Similarly, wherever there are people who are spiritually dead, God will punish
them\add*.”
