\c 22  
\s Luke 22:1-6 
\s Judas agreed to put Jesus into his enemies' hands. 
\p
\v 1 It was now almost time to celebrate the festival of Unleavened Bread, which
\add began with\add* the Passover feast. 
\v 2 The chief priests and the men who taught the \add Jewish\add* laws were seeking a way to kill Jesus.
\add But they wanted to do it secretly\add*, because they were afraid that if
\add they did not do\add* it secretly, the people \add might riot\add*.
\p
\v 3 Then \add even though\add* Judas, who was called \add the man
from\add* Kerioth \add village\add*, was one of the twelve \add disciples\add*, Satan entered him.
\v 4 He went and conferred with the chief priests and the officers of the Temple guards. He discussed with them how he could
enable them to seize \add Jesus\add*. 
\v 5 They were pleased \add that he wanted to do that\add*. They offered to give him money
\add for doing it\add*. 
\v 6 So he agreed, \add and they gave him the money\add*. Then he tried to find an opportunity to enable them to seize
\add Jesus\add* when there was no crowd around him. 
\s Luke 22:7-13 
\s Jesus arranged for his disciples to prepare the Passover meal.
\p
\v 7 Then the day during the \add first part of the week-long festival\add* of Unleavened Bread came,
\add the day\add* when \add the\add* lambs \add for the\add* Passover\add celebration\add* had to be killed.
\v 8 So Jesus said to Peter and John, “Go and prepare the meal for the Passover
\add celebration\add*.” 
\v 9 They replied to him, “Where do you\add (sg)\add* want us to prepare it?”
\v 10 He said to the \add two of\add* them, “Listen carefully. When you
\add two\add* enter the city, a man who is carrying a \add large\add* jar of water will meet you. Follow him.
\add When\add* he enters \add a house\add*, 
\v 11 tell the owner of the house, ‘\add Our\add* teacher says\add that we(exc)
should\add* ask \add you(sg) to please\add* show \add us\add* the room that
\add he arranged with you\add* where he can eat the Passover \add meal\add* with
\add us\add*, his disciples \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*.’ 
\v 12 He will show you a large room that is on the upper \add floor of the
house\add*. It will be all set up \add for a meal\add*. Prepare the meal for us there.”
\v 13 So \add the two disciples\add* went \add into the city\add*. They found everything to be just like
\add Jesus\add* had told them. So they prepared \add the meal for\add* the Passover
\add celebration there\add*. 
\s Luke 22:14-23 
\s Jesus told them how they should remember his death for them. 
\p
\v 14 When it was time \f + \fr metonymy \f* \add to eat the meal\add*, Jesus \add came
and\add* sat down with the \add twelve\add* apostles. 
\v 15 He said to them, “I have greatly desired to eat this Passover
\add meal\add* with you before I suffer \add and die\add*. 
\v 16 I want you to know that I will not eat \add the Passover meal\add* again until all those whose lives God rules completely
realize \add what it represents\add*.” 
\v 17 Then he took a cup \add of wine\add* and thanked \add God for
it\add*. Then he said, “Take this, and each of you drink some of it.
\v 18 I want you to know that \add from now on\add* I will not drink wine until God makes me king.”
\v 19 Then he took some bread and thanked God for it. He broke it
\add into pieces\add* and gave it to them \add to eat\add*. He said, “This
\add bread represents\add* my body, which \add I\add* am about to sacrifice for you. Keep on
\add eating bread\add* this way \add regularly\add* to remember what I
\add have done for you\add*.” 
\v 20 Similarly, after \add they had eaten\add* the meal, he took
\add another\add* cup \add of wine\add*. He said, “\add The wine
in\add* \f + \fr metonymy \f* this cup \add represents\add* my blood, which will soon flow
\add from my body when I die\add*. \add With\add* this blood \add I will
sign\add* the new agreement \add that God is making with\add* you.
\v 21 But \add note that\add* the one \f + \fr synecdoche \f* who will enable my enemies to seize me is eating right here with me!
\v 22  \add It is certain that I\add*, the one who came from heaven, will die, because that is what
\add God\add* has planned. But there will be terrible punishment for the man who will ◄betray me/enable my enemies to seize
me►!” 
\v 23 Then they began to ask one another, “Which of us would do such a thing?”
\s Luke 22:24-30 
\s Jesus taught them that they should imitate him by serving each other humbly.
\p
\v 24  \add The apostles\add* began to argue among themselves, saying, “Which one of us
\add will be\add* the greatest \add when Jesus becomes king\add*?”
\v 25 So Jesus said to them, “The kings of the non-Jews \add enjoy\add* showing that they are powerful.
\add Yet\add* they give \add themselves\add* the title, ‘ones who help the people.’
\v 26 But you should not be like them! Instead, those who \add want God
to\add* \add consider them\add* the greatest should \add act as though
they\add* were the youngest, \add since the youngest are expected to serve the older
ones\add*. Whoever is a leader should be one who serves \add the
others\add*. 
\v 27 Keep in mind who is the most important one \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*. It is certainly the one who
\add just sits\add* at the table, not \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* those who serve \add the
meal\add*. But I, \add your leader\add*, have been \add an example for
you\add* by serving you \add while I have been\add* among you. 
\p
\v 28 You are the ones who have stayed with me during all my troubles.
\v 29 So now, just like my Father has appointed me to rule as a king, I am appointing you
\v 30 so that you can sit and eat \add and rule\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f* with me when I become king. You will sit on thrones to judge the
people of the twelve tribes of Israel.” 
\s Luke 22:31-34 
\s Jesus predicted that Peter would say that he did not know Jesus.
\p
\v 31 “Simon, Simon, listen! Satan has asked \add God to let him test you, and God has permitted him to do it. Satan wants to
cause you to suffer distress\add* (OR, \add distress you\add*) \add so that you will not believe/trust in me anymore/longer. He
wants to shake you, just like a man shakes wheat in a sieve\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f*.
\v 32 But I have prayed for you, Simon, that you will not completely stop believing in me. So when
you\add (sg)\add* restore your relationship with me, help your fellow apostles
\add to trust in me more\add*!” 
\v 33 Peter said to him, “Lord, I am ready to go with you\add (sg)\add* if they put you in prison, or even to die with you!”
\v 34 Jesus replied, “Peter, I want you\add (sg)\add* to know that this night, before the rooster crows, you will say three
times that you do not know me!” 
\s Luke 22:35-38 
\s Jesus warned his disciples that they would soon face opposition.
\p
\v 35 Then \add Jesus\add* asked all of them, “After I sent you out
\add to other villages, and you went\add* without taking any money or a
\add traveling\add* bag or \add extra\add* sandals, you did not lack anything, did you?” They replied,
“\add That's right\add*, \add we(exc) did\add* not \add lack\add* anything.”
\v 36 Then, \add to show them that now many people would oppose them\add*, (OR,
\add to show them that they needed to be prepared to protect themselves\add*,) he said to them, “Now
\add things will be different. So\add* whoever among you has some money should take it with him. Likewise, he should take a
carrying bag. Whoever does not have a sword should sell his coat and buy a sword.
\v 37 Because, I now tell you, \add something must happen to me to fulfill these words that a
prophet\add* wrote: ‘He was treated {They treated him} as \add though he
were\add* a criminal.’ Do not forget that everything that is {that they have} written about me
\add in the Scriptures\add* must be fulfilled.” 
\v 38 The disciples said, “Lord, look! We\add (exc)\add* have two swords!”
\add Realizing that they did not understand the meaning of what he
said\add*, he replied to them, “That is enough \add talk about swords!\add*”
\s Luke 22:39-46 
\s Jesus prayed alone intensely. 
\p
\v 39 As \add Jesus\add* left \add the city\add*, he went, as he usually did, to Olive
\add Tree\add* Hill. His disciples went with him. 
\v 40 When he came to the place \add where he often spent the night\add*, he said to them, “Pray that
\add God will help you\add* whenever something tempts you.” 
\v 41 Then he went from them a distance of about thirty meters/yards. (OR, as far as someone can throw a stone.) He knelt and
prayed, 
\v 42 “\add My\add* Father, if you are willing \add to do it\add*, permit that I do not
\add have to undergo\add* these terrible things that \add are about to happen to
me\add* \f + \fr metonymy \f*. But do not do what I want. Instead, do what you want.”
\v 43 Then an angel from heaven appeared to him and caused him to become stronger.
\v 44 He was greatly distressed. So he prayed more earnestly. His sweat fell down on the ground as though it was large drops of
blood. 
\v 45 When he got up from praying, he returned to his disciples. He found that they were sleeping. They were exhausted because
they were very sorrowful. 
\v 46 He \add woke them and\add* said to them, “◄I am disappointed that you are sleeping!/Why are you sleeping?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* Get up!
Pray that \add God will help you\add* whenever you are tempted {when something
\add like this\add* tempts you}!” 
\s Luke 22:47-53 
\s Jesus' enemies captured him. 
\p
\v 47 While \add Jesus\add* was still speaking, a crowd \add came to
him\add*. Judas, \add even though he was\add* one of the twelve \add disciples\add*, was leading them. He came close to Jesus
and kissed him \add on the cheek to signal to those with him which one was
Jesus\add*. 
\v 48 Jesus said to him, “Judas, ◄I am disappointed that it is by kissing me that you are enabling
\add my enemies\add* to seize \add me\add*, the one who came from heaven!/is it by kissing me
\add as though you loved me\add* that you are enabling \add my enemies\add* to seize
\add me\add*, the one who came from heaven?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*” 
\v 49 When the \add disciples\add* who were around Jesus realized what was going to happen, they said, “Lord, shall
we\add (exc)\add* strike \add them\add* with our swords?” 
\v 50 One of them \add drew his sword and\add* struck the servant of the high priest
\add to kill him, but only\add* cut off his right ear. 
\v 51 But Jesus said, “Do not \add do\add* any more of that!” He touched the
\add servant's\add* ear and healed him. 
\v 52-53 Then Jesus said to the chief priests, the officers of the Temple guards, and the
\add Jewish\add* elders who had come to \add seize\add* him, “◄It is ridiculous that you have come
\add here\add* with swords and clubs to capture \f + \fr metonymy \f* me, as \add if I
were\add* a bandit!/Why have you come here with swords and clubs to capture \f + \fr metonymy \f* me, as if I were a bandit?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* Day after
day \add I was with you\add* in the Temple \add courtyard\add*, \add and\add* you did not seize me! But this is the time \f + \fr metonymy \f*
when \add God is allowing\add* you \add to do what you want\add*. It is also the time \f + \fr metonymy \f* when God is allowing
\add Satan, who rules\add* \f + \fr metonymy \f* \add in\add* the darkness, \add to do what he
wants\add*.” 
\s Luke 22:54-62 
\s Peter said three times that he did not know Jesus. 
\p
\v 54 They seized \add Jesus\add* and led him away. They brought him to the high priest's house. Peter followed
\add them\add* at a distance. 
\v 55 They kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together. Peter sat among them.
\v 56 As the light \add from the fire\add* shone \add on his face,
a\add* female servant saw him and looked intently at him. She said, “This man was also with
\add the man whom they have arrested\add*!” 
\v 57 But he denied it, saying, “Woman, I do not know him!” 
\v 58 A little later someone else saw Peter and said, “You\add (sg)\add* also are one of those who
\add were with\add* the man \add they arrested\add*!” But Peter said, “Man, I am not
\add one of them\add*!” 
\v 59 About an hour later someone else said emphatically \add about
Peter\add*, “\add The way\add* that this man \add speaks shows that
he\add* is from Galilee \add district\add*. Certainly this man was also with the man whom
\add they arrested, who is from Galilee\add*!” 
\v 60 But Peter said, “Man, I do not know what you\add (sg)\add* are talking about!” Immediately, while he was still speaking,
a rooster crowed. 
\v 61 The Lord \add Jesus\add* turned around and looked right at Peter. Then Peter remembered what the Lord had said to him,
“This night, before the rooster crows, you\add (sg)\add* will deny three times
\add that you know\add* me.” 
\v 62 And he went out \add of the courtyard\add* and cried very sorrowfully.
\s Luke 22:63-65 
\s The soldiers made fun of Jesus. 
\p
\v 63 The men who were guarding Jesus made fun of him and beat him.
\v 64 They put a blindfold on him and \add beat him again. Then\add* they said to him,
“\add Because you(sg) say\add* \f + \fr irony \f* that you are a prophet, \add prove it
by\add* telling us who it was that struck you!” 
\v 65 They said many other evil things about him, insulting him.
\s Luke 22:66-71 
\s The Jewish leaders asked Jesus about his identity. 
\p
\v 66 At dawn \add the next morning\add*, many of the \add Jewish\add* leaders gathered together. The group included the chief
priests and the men who taught the \add Jewish\add* laws. They took Jesus to the Jewish Council. There they said to him,
\v 67 “If you\add (sg)\add* are the Messiah, tell us!” But he replied, “If I tell you that, you will not believe me.
\v 68 If I ask you \add what you think about the Messiah\add*, you will not answer me.
\v 69 But some day you will see \add me\add*, the one who came from heaven, sitting next to almighty God and ruling \f + \fr metonymy \f*!”
\v 70 Then they all said, “If that is so, are \add you(sg) saying
that\add* you are ◄the Son of God/the Man who is also God►?” He said to them,
“\add Yes\add*, it is just like you say \f + \fr metonymy \f*.” 
\v 71 Then they said \add to each other\add*, “◄We\add (inc)\add* certainly do not need any more people to testify
\add against him\add*!/Why should we ask for any more people to testify
\add against him\add*?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*” We ourselves have heard him say \f + \fr metonymy \f*
\add that he is equal with God!\add*
