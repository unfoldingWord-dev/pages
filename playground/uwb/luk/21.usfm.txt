\c 21  
\s Luke 21:1-4 
\s Jesus taught that God commends people who give to him sacrificially.
\p
\v 1  \add Jesus\add* looked up \add from where he was sitting\add* and saw rich people putting their gifts into the
\add offering\add* boxes \add in the Temple courtyard\add*. 
\v 2 He also saw a poor widow putting in two \add small\add* copper coins.
\v 3-4 He said \add to his disciples\add*, "The truth is that these rich people have a lot of money,
\add but\add* they gave \add only a small part of it\add*. But this woman, who is very poor, has put in all the money that she
had to pay for the things she needs! So \add God considers that\add* \f + \ft hyperbole \f* this poor widow has put more money into the box than
all the others." 
\s Luke 21:5-19 
\s Jesus warned them about the terrible things that will happen before he returns.
\p
\v 5 Some \add of Jesus' disciples\add* talked about the Temple.
\add They commented about\add* the beautiful stones \add used in building the
Temple\add* and the other decorations that \add people\add* had given, decorations
\add that were on the walls\add*. But he said, 
\v 6 "\add I want to tell you something about\add* these things that you are looking at.
\add They will be destroyed\add* {\add Foreign invaders will\add*
destroy\add these buildings\add*} \add completely\add*. Every stone
\add in these buildings\add* will be thrown down {They will throw down every stone in these buildings}. Not one stone will be
left {They will not leave one stone} on top of another." 
\p
\v 7  \add Later\add* they asked him, "Teacher, when will that happen? What will happen to indicate that the things
\add you(sg) just told us\add* are about to happen?" 
\v 8 He said, "\add All that I will say is\add*, be sure that you are not deceived {that they do not deceive
\add you\add*} \add about these things\add*! Many \add people\add* will come and say that I
\add sent them\add*\f + \ft Or: that they have my authority \f* \f + \ft metonymy \f*. They will say, 'I am
\add the Messiah\add*!' They will also \add say\add* 'It is now the time
\add when God will begin to rule\add*!' Do not follow them \add to become their
disciples\add*! 
\v 9 Also, whenever you hear about wars and riots, do not be terrified. Keep in mind
that\add God has said that\add* those things must happen. But \add when they
happen\add*, it will not mean that \add the world\add* will end right away!"
\p
\v 10 Then he said to them, "\add Groups in various\add* countries will fight each other, and
\add various\add* governments \add will also fight\add* against each other.
\v 11 There will be \add big\add* earthquakes, and in various places there will be famines and plagues.
\add People will see\add* things that will terrify them. There will also be unusual things happening in the sky.
\v 12 But before all these things happen, \add some of\add* you will be persecuted and arrested {people will persecute you and
arrest you} \f + \ft metonymy \f*. \add Some of\add* you will be put {They will put
\add some of\add* you} \add on trial\add* in the places where you gather to worship, and
\add you will be thrown\add* into prison. You will be put on trial
{\add They\add* will put you on trial} in front of high government authorities because you are my \f + \ft metonymy \f*
\add disciples\add*. 
\v 13 That will be a time for you to tell \add them about me\add*.
\v 14 So determine within yourselves not to be thinking before that happens what you will say to defend yourselves,
\v 15 because I will make you wise \f + \ft hendiadys \f* so that you will \add know\add* what to say. As a result, none of your enemies will be
able to oppose what you say or refute you\f + \ft Or: show that you are wrong \f*.
\v 16  \add And there will also be other evil things that will happen\add*: Even your parents and brothers and
\add other\add* relatives and friends \add who do not believe in
me\add* will betray you\f + \ft Or: help your enemies to seize you \f*. They will kill some of you.
\v 17  \add In general\add*, most people will \f + \ft hyperbole \f* hate you because
\add you believe in\add* me \f + \ft metonymy \f*. 
\v 18 But your souls will be absolutely safe \f + \ft idiom \f*. 
\v 19 By enduring \add all these things people will do to you\add*, you will preserve your
\add eternal\add* life \f + \ft synecdoche \f*." 
\s Luke 21:20-24 
\s Jesus predicted that Jerusalem would be destroyed. 
\p
\v 20 "But when you see that Jerusalem has been surrounded by the armies of
\add your enemies\add*, you will know that it is the time for \add this
city\add* to be completely destroyed {\add them\add* to completely destroy
\add this city\add*}. 
\v 21 At that time those \add of you\add* who are in Judea \add district\add* must flee to the
\add higher\add* hills. Those who are in this city must leave \add quickly\add*. Those who are in the nearby countryside must
not go back into the city \add to get any of their possessions before they
flee\add*. 
\v 22  \add You must obey what I tell you\add* because, in order that all the things that are
written\add in the Scriptures\add* will be fulfilled, \add God\add* will very severely punish
\add the people who stay in this city\add*. 
\v 23  \add I feel\add* very sorry for women \add in this city\add* who will be pregnant, and women who will be nursing
\add their babies\add* in those days, \add because it will be very difficult for them to run away!
I\add* feel sorry \add because\add* the people in this \add land\add* will suffer greatly \f + \ft metonymy \f*
\add when God punishes them\add*. 
\v 24 Many of them will be killed {Their enemies will kill many of them} with swords.
\add Others will be captured\add* and taken {They will capture \add others\add* and take them} to \f + \ft hyperbole \f*
\add other\add* countries. Non-Jewish people will trample over Jerusalem until the time
\add that God has determined for them to rule the city\add* is ended."
\s Luke 21:25-28 
\s Jesus told them about the frightening things that will happen before he returns.
\p
\v 25 "There will also be strange things that will \add happen to\add* the sun, the moon, and the stars. In
\add many\add* nations on the earth, \add people\add* will be very frightened, and they will be anxious
\add when they hear\add* the ocean roaring and \add see the huge\add* waves.
\v 26 People will faint because they will be afraid as they wait for what will happen in the world.
\add They will be afraid\add* because the powerful \add objects\add* in the sky will be shaken {shake}.
\v 27 Then they will see \add me\add*, the one who came from heaven, coming in a cloud powerfully and very gloriously.
\v 28 So when these things that \add I have just now described\add* begin to happen, stand up
\add straight and\add* be brave, because it will be close to the time when
\add God\add* will free you \add from all suffering\add*." 
\s Luke 21:29-33 
\s Jesus taught them how to know when his return was near. 
\p
\v 29  \add Then\add* he told them this parable: "Think about the fig tree, and all the
\add other\add* trees. 
\v 30 As soon as you see their leaves beginning to sprout, you know that summer is near.
\v 31 Similarly, when you see these things that \add I have just
described\add* happening, you will know that it is almost time for God to
\add truly\add* rule as king. 
\v 32 Keep this in mind: All the things that \add I have just now
described\add* will happen before all the people who have observed the things that I have done have died.
\v 33  \add You can be certain that these things\add* that I have told
\add you\add* about will happen. That they will happen is more\add certain\add* than that the earth and sky will continue to
exist." 
\s Luke 21:34-38 
\s Jesus taught them how to be ready for his return. 
\p
\v 34 "But be on guard. Do not be getting drunk with carousing or let yourselves be distracted by worries
\add concerning\add* your lives \f + \ft synecdoche \f* {or let worries \add concerning\add* your lives \f + \ft synecdoche \f* distract you}.
\add If you do wrong things like these, you may be suddenly surprised by my
return\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*, like a trap \add suddenly catches an animal in
it\add*. 
\v 35  \add You need to know that my return will surprise\add* everyone all over the earth.
\v 36 So be ready at all times. Pray that you will be able to endure without being afraid of all these
\add difficult\add* things that will happen, so that you will then stand
\add confidently\add* before me, the one who came from heaven." 
\p
\v 37 Each day \add during that week Jesus\add* taught the people in the Temple
\add courtyard in Jerusalem\add*. But at night he \add and his disciples\add* left
\add the city\add* and stayed on Olive \add Tree\add* Hill. 
\v 38 Early \add each\add* morning many people came to the Temple
\add courtyard\add* to listen to him.
