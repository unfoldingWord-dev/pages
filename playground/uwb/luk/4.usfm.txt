\s Luke 3:1-20 
\s What John the Baptizer preached. 
\p
\v 1 As Jesus left the Jordan \add River valley, the Holy Spirit
was\add* completely controlling him. 
\v 2 For forty days the Spirit led him around in the desolate area. During that time Jesus was being tempted by the devil {the
devil was tempting him}, and Jesus did not eat anything. When that time ended, he was
\add very\add* hungry. 
\v 3 Then the devil said to Jesus, "Because you \add claim that you\add*
\add have a relationship with\add* God as a son \add has with his
father\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*\f + \ft Or: are the man who is both God and man \f*, \add prove it
by\add* telling these stones to become bread \add so that you can eat
them!\add*" 
\v 4 Jesus replied, "\add No, I will not change stones into bread, because it is
written\add* {\add Moses\add* wrote} \add in the Scriptures\add* that
\add eating\add* food sustains people physically, but it does not
\add sustain them spiritually. They also need food for their spirits\add*."
\v 5 Then the devil took him on top of \add a high mountain\add* and showed him in an instant all the nations in the world.
\v 6 Then he said to \add Jesus\add*, "I will give you the authority
\add to rule\add* all these areas and will make you famous. \add I can do
this\add* because \add God\add* has permitted me \add to control these
areas\add*, and I can allow anyone I desire to rule them! 
\v 7 So if you worship me, I will \add let\add* you \add rule\add* them all!"
\v 8 But Jesus replied, "\add No, I\add* will not \add worship you,
because\add* it is written {\add the Psalmist\add* wrote} \add in the
Scriptures\add*, 'It is the Lord, your God, whom you must worship, and you must serve only him!'"
\p
\v 9 Then the devil took \add Jesus\add* to Jerusalem. He set him on the highest part of the Temple and said to him, "Because
you \add claim that you\add* \add have a relationship with God as a son has with his
father\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*\f + \ft Or: are the man who is both God and man \f*, \add prove it
by\add* jumping down from here. 
\v 10  \add You will not be hurt\add*, because it is written {the
\add Psalmist\add* wrote} \add in the Scriptures\add*, 'God will command his angels to protect
you\add (sg)\add*. 
\v 11 They will lift you up in their hands \add when you are falling\add*, so that
\add you will not get hurt\add*. You will not \add even\add* strike your foot on a stone.'"
\v 12 But Jesus replied, "\add No, I\add* will not \add do that,
because\add* it is written {\add Moses\add* wrote} \add in the Scriptures\add*: 'Do not try to test the Lord your God
\add to see if he will prevent something bad from happening to you when you do something
foolish\add*'." 
\p
\v 13 Then, after the devil had finished trying to tempt \add Jesus\add* in many ways, he left him. He wanted to try to tempt
him later at an appropriate time. 
\s Luke 4:14-15 
\s Jesus began his work in Galilee district. 
\p
\v 14 As the Spirit empowered him, Jesus returned to Galilee\add district.
People\add* throughout all that region heard about what he \add was
doing\add*. 
\v 15 He taught \add people\add* in their synagogues\f + \ft Or: meeting places \f*.
\add As a result\add*, he was praised by everyone {everyone praised him}.
\s Luke 4:16-30 
\s The people of Jesus' hometown tried to kill him after he rebuked them for rejecting him.
\p
\v 16 Then \add Jesus\add* went to Nazareth, \add the town\add* where he grew up. On the Sabbath\f + \ft Or: On the Jewish rest day \f* he
went to the synagogue\f + \ft Or: to the Jewish meeting place \f*, as he usually did. He stood up
\add to indicate that he wanted\add* to read \add Scriptures\add* to them.
\v 17 A scroll containing \add the words\add* that the prophet Isaiah
\add had written\add* was given to him {\add Someone\add* gave to him a scroll containing
\add the words\add* that the prophet Isaiah \add had written\add*}. He opened the scroll and found the place from which he
\add wanted to\add* read. \add He read these words\add*: 
\q
\v 18 The Spirit of the Lord\f + \ft Or: of God \f* is upon me. 
\q He has appointed \f + \ft metonymy \f* me to declare God's good news to the poor.
\q He has sent me \add here\add* to proclaim that God will deliver those whom
\add Satan\add* has captured, and 
\q he will \add enable me to\add* enable those who are blind to see.
\q He will enable me to free people who have been oppressed {whom
\add others\add* have oppressed}. 
\q
\v 19 And he sent me to declare that now is the time when the Lord\f + \ft Or: God \f* will
\add act\add* favorably \add toward people\add*. 
\p
\v 20 Then he rolled up the scroll and gave it back to the attendant, and sat down
\add to teach the people\add*. Everyone in the synagogue was looking intently \f + \ft metonymy \f* at him.
\v 21 He said to them, "Today as you have been hearing \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add me
speak\add*, \add I am beginning\add* to fulfill this Scripture passage."
\v 22  \add At first\add* everyone there spoke well about him, and they were amazed at the charming words that he spoke.
\add But then some of\add* them said, "He is \add only\add* Joseph's son!\f + \ft Or: Isn't he
\add only\add* Joseph's son? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add So\add* \add it is useless for us(exc) to listen to what he says!\f + \ft Or: why should we(exc)
listen to what he says\add*? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*" 
\v 23 He said to them, "Surely \add some of\add* you will quote to me the proverb that says, 'Doctor, heal yourself!'
\add What you will mean is\add*, 'People told us that you did miracles in Capernaum
\add town, but we(exc) do not know if those reports are true. So\add* do miracles here in your own hometown, too!'"
\v 24 Then he said, "It is certainly true that \add people\add* do not accept
\add the message of\add* a prophet when he speaks in his hometown,
\add just like you(pl) are not accepting my message now\add*. 
\v 25 But think about this: There were many widows in Israel during the time when
\add the prophet\add* Elijah \add lived. During that time\add*, because of there being no rain \f + \ft metonymy \f* for three years and six
months, there was a great famine throughout the country. 
\v 26 But \add God\add* did not send Elijah to \add help\add* any of those
\add Jewish\add* widows. \add God sent him\add* to Zarepath \add town\add* near Sidon
\add city\add*, to \add help\add* a \add non-Jewish\add* widow. 
\v 27 There were also many \add Jewish\add* lepers in Israel during the time when the prophet Elisha
\add lived\add*. But \add Elisha\add* did not heal any of them. He healed only Naaman, a
\add non-Jewish\add* man from Syria." 
\v 28 When all the people in the synagogue heard him say that, they were very angry,
\add because they realized that he was inferring that he similarly would help non-Jewish people instead of helping
Jews\add* \f + \ft Or: \add that they also were not worthy of receiving God's
help\add* \f*. 
\v 29 So they all got up and shoved him out of the town. They took him to the top of the hill outside their town in order to
throw him off the cliff \add and kill him\add*. 
\v 30 But he \add simply\add* walked through their midst and went away.
\s Luke 4:31-37 
\s Jesus expelled an evil spirit. 
\p
\v 31  \add One day\add* he went \add with his disciples\add* down to Capernaum, a town in Galilee
\add district\add*. On the next Sabbath\f + \ft Or: Jewish day of rest \f* \f + \ft Or: Each Sabbath( Or: Jewish day of rest ) \f*, he taught the people
\add in the synagogue\f + \ft Or: in the Jewish meeting place\add* \f*. 
\v 32 They were continually amazed at what he was teaching, because
\add he spoke\add* \add with authority\f + \ft Or: as people speak who have\add* the right to command others what to do \f*.
\v 33  \add That day\add*, \f + \ft Or: On one of those Jewish days of rest, \f* there was a man in the synagogue who was controlled by an
evil spirit. That man shouted very loudly, 
\v 34 "Hey! Jesus, from Nazareth! \add We(exc) evil spirits\add* have nothing in common with you, so
\add do not interfere with us now!\f + \ft Or: why should you interfere with us
now\add*? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* Do not destroy us \add now!\add*\f + \ft Or: Have you come to destroy us
\add now\add*? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* I know who you are. You are the Holy One \add who has
come\add* from God!" 
\v 35 Jesus rebuked \add the evil spirit\add*, saying, "Be quiet! And come out
\add of the man\add*!" The demon threw the man down on the ground in the midst of the people. But without harming the man, the
demon left him. 
\v 36 The people were all amazed. They said to each other, "What he says to the demons
\add has great power!\f + \ft Or: \add*What \add kind of\add* teaching is this? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* He speaks to them like he knows that they must obey
him, and as a result they leave people!" 
\v 37 The people were telling everyone in \add every village\add* in the surrounding region what Jesus
\add had done\add*. 
\s Luke 4:38-41 
\s Jesus healed Simon's mother-in-law and many others. 
\p
\v 38 Jesus \add and his disciples\add* left the synagogue\f + \ft Or: the Jewish meeting place \f* and went into Simon's house. Simon's
mother-in-law was sick and had a high fever. So \add others in Simon's
family\add* (OR\add , the disciples\add*) asked Jesus to \add heal\add* her.
\v 39 So he bent over her and rebuked the fever. At once she became well! She got up and served them
\add some food\add*. 
\p
\v 40 When the sun was setting \add that day, and the restriction about not
traveling\add* on \add the Sabbath\f + \ft Or: on the Jewish rest day\add* \f*
\add was ended\add*, many people \f + \ft hyperbole \f* whose \add friends or relatives\add* were sick or who had various diseases brought them
to Jesus. He put his hands on them and healed \add all of\add* them.
\v 41 He also was \add expelling demons\add* from many people. As the demons left those people, they shouted to Jesus, "You are
the Son of God\f + \ft Or: the one who is God and man \f*!" But he rebuked those demons and would not allow them to tell
\add people about him\add*, because they knew that he was the Messiah, and
\add for various reasons he did not want everyone to know that yet\add*.
\s Luke 4:42-44 
\s Jesus told them that he had to preach in other towns. 
\p
\v 42  \add Early\add* the next morning \add Jesus\add* left that house and went to an uninhabited place
\add to pray\add*. Many people searched for him, and when they found him they kept urging him not to leave them.
\v 43 But he said to them, "I must tell \add people\add* in other towns also the good message about how God wants to rule \f + \ft metaphor \f*
their lives, because that is what I was sent {\add God\add* sent me} to do."
\v 44 So he kept preaching in the synagogues\f + \ft Or: Jewish worship places \f*
\add in various towns\add* in Judea \add province\add*.
