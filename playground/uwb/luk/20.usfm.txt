\c 20  
\s Luke 20:1-8 
\s Jesus refused to answer their question about his authority. 
\p
\v 1 One day \add during that week Jesus\add* was teaching the people in the Temple
\add courtyard\add* and telling them \add God's\add* good message. As he was doing that, the chief priests, the men who taught
the \add Jewish\add* laws, and \add other Jewish\add* elders came to him.
\v 2 They said to him, “Tell us, by what authority are you doing these things? Who authorized you to do things
\add like you did here yesterday\add*?” 
\v 3 He replied, “I will also ask you a question. Tell me, 
\v 4 where did John \add the Baptizer\add* get \add his authority
to\add* baptize \add those who came to him\add*? \add Did he get
it\add* from God [MTY/EUP] or from people?” 
\v 5 They discussed this among themselves. They said, “\add If we(inc)
say\add*, ‘\add It was\add* from God [MTY/EUP],’ he will say to us,
‘\add Then\add* ◄you should have believed John's \add message\add*!/why did you not believe what John preached?► \f + \fk rhetorical question \f*’
\v 6 But if we say, ‘It was \add from\add* people,’ the people \add here\add* will
\add kill us by\add* throwing stones at us, because they \add all\add* believe that John was a prophet
\add from God\add*.” 
\v 7 So they replied, “We\add (exc)\add* do not know where \add John got his
authority\add*.” 
\v 8 Then Jesus said to them, “\add Because you did not answer my
question\add*, I will not tell you who authorized me to do those things
\add here yesterday\add*.” 
\s Luke 20:9-18 
\s Jesus told a parable about how God would punish those who reject him.
\p
\v 9 Then Jesus told the people this parable \add to illustrate what God would do to the Jews who rejected the former prophets
and himself\add*: “A \add certain\add* man planted a vineyard. He rented the vineyard to some men
\add to care for it and to give him some of the grapes in return\add*. Then he went to another country and stayed there several
years. 
\v 10 When it was \add time to\add* harvest the grapes, he sent a servant to the men who were taking care of the vineyard. He
expected that they would give him some of the grapes that the vineyard had produced. But
\add after the servant arrived\add*, they beat him and they did not give him any grapes. They
\add just\add* sent him away. 
\v 11  \add Later\add*, \add the owner\add* sent another servant. But they beat him and mistreated him
\add also\add*. They sent him away without giving him any grapes.
\v 12  \add Still later, the owner\add* sent another servant. That one they wounded and threw him out
\add of the vineyard\add*. 
\v 13 So the owner of the vineyard said to himself, ‘◄I do not know what to do!/What shall I do?► \f + \fk rhetorical question \f*’
\add Then he had an idea. He said to himself\add*, ‘I will send my son,
\add whom I\add* love \add very much\add*. Perhaps they will respect him
\add and give him my share of the grapes\add*.’ 
\v 14  \add So he sent his son\add*, but when the men who were caring for the vineyard saw him
\add coming\add*, they said to each other, ‘Here \add comes\add* the man who will
\add some day\add* inherit \add the vineyard\add*! Let's kill him so that this vineyard will be ours!’
\v 15 So they dragged him outside the vineyard and they killed him. So ◄I will tell you what the owner of the vineyard will do
to them!/do you know what the owner of the vineyard will do to them?► \f + \fk rhetorical question \f*
\v 16 He will come and kill those men who were taking care of the vineyard. Then he will arrange for other people to take care
of it.” When they heard that, they said, “\add We would\add* not do anything like those wicked men did!”
\v 17 But Jesus looked directly at them and said, “You can say that,
\add but think about\add* the meaning of these words that are written {which
\add a prophet\add* wrote} \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* \add in the Scriptures\add*, 
\q The men who were building a house rejected a certain stone. But others put that same stone in its proper place, and it has
become the most important stone in the building \f + \fk metaphor \f*. 
\p
\v 18  \add That stone represents me, the Messiah\add*, and those who reject me are
\add like people who fall on this stone\add*. Everyone who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces {This stone will break
to pieces everyone who falls on it}, and it will crush anyone on whom it falls.”
\s Luke 20:19-26 
\s Jesus foiled their attempts to trap him when they asked a question about paying taxes.
\p
\v 19 The chief priests and the men who taught the \add Jewish\add* laws realized that he was accusing them when he told the
parable \add about what those wicked men did\add*. So they immediately tried to find a way to seize \f + \fk metonymy \f* him, but
\add they did not seize him, because\add* they were afraid of \add what\add* the
people\add there would do if they did that\add*. 
\v 20 So they watched him carefully. They also hired ◄spies/secret agents► who pretended to be sincere.
\add But\add* they really wanted to get him to say something for
\add which they could accuse\add* him. They wanted to be able to turn him over to the authority of the governor
\add of the province. But they also knew that the Jews were disgusted with having to pay taxes to the
government\add*. 
\v 21  \add So\add* one of them asked him, “Teacher, we\add (exc)\add* know that
you\add (sg)\add* speak and teach what is right. You tell the truth even if important people do not like it. You teach
truthfully what God wants us to do. 
\v 22  \add So tell us what you think about this matter\add*: Is it right that we pay taxes to the Roman government \f + \fk metonymy \f*, or
not?” 
\v 23 But he knew that they were trying to trick him \add to get him into trouble, either with the Jews, who hated to pay those
taxes, or with the Roman government\add*. So he said to them, 
\v 24 “Show me a \add Roman\add* coin. \add Then tell me\add* whose picture
\add they have\add* put on it. And\add tell me whose\add* name is on it.” They
\add showed him a coin and\add* said, “It has the picture and name of Caesar,
\add the head of the Roman government\add*.” 
\v 25 He said to them, “In that case, give to the government \f + \fk metonymy \f* what they
\add require\add*, and give to God what he \add requires\add*.” 
\v 26 While the people were there, the \add spies\add* were unable to find fault with him for what he said. They were amazed at
his answer. So they said nothing. 
\s Luke 20:27-40 
\s Jesus foiled their attempt to trap him with a question that they asked him about the resurrection.
\p
\v 27 Some Sadducees came to \add Jesus\add*. They are a Jewish sect who do not believe that people will become alive again
after they die. 
\v 28 They\add wanted to\add* ask\add Jesus\add* a question\add in order to discredit the idea that dead people will live
again\add*. One of them said \add to him\add*, “Teacher, Moses wrote for us
\add Jews\add* that if a man who has a wife but no children dies, his brother should marry the
\add dead man's\add* widow so that she can have a child by him. People\add will
consider\add* that the child is the descendant of the man \add who
died\add*, \add and in that way the dead man will have descendants\add*.
\v 29 Well, there were seven boys in one family. The oldest one married a woman, but he and his wife did not bear any children.
Later he died. 
\v 30 The second \add brother followed this law and married the widow, but the same thing happened to
him\add*. 
\v 31 Then the third \add brother\add* married her, \add but the same thing happened
again\add*. All seven \add brothers, one by one, married that woman\add*,
\add but\add* they had no children, and \add one by one\add* they died.
\v 32 Afterwards, the woman died, too. 
\v 33 Therefore, \add if it is true that there will be a time\add* when dead people will become alive again, whose wife
\add do you think that woman\add* will be \add then\add*? ◄\add Keep in mind that she was married to all seven brothers!/It
will be impossible to decide because\add* she was married to all seven brothers!► \f + \fk rhetorical question \f*”
\v 34 Jesus replied to them, “Men who live here in this world take wives, or are given wives
\add by their parents\add* {their \add parents\add* choose wives
\add for them\add*}. 
\v 35 But the men whom God considers worthy of \add being in heaven
after\add* they become alive again will not be married. 
\v 36  \add You need to know also that\add* they cannot die anymore, because they will be
\add immortal\add* \f + \fk simile \f* like angels. \add The fact that God has
caused\add* them to be alive again \add will show\add* that they are God's children.
\v 37 But \add as to people\add* becoming alive again after they die, Moses wrote something about that. In the place where
\add he wrote about\add* the \add burning\add* bush, he mentions the Lord as being the God whom Abraham
\add worships\add* and the God whom Isaac \add worships\add* and the God whom Jacob
\add worships\add*. 
\v 38 It is not dead people who worship God. It is living people who worship him.
\add Abraham, Isaac and Jacob died long before Moses lived, but God said that they were still worshipping him, so we(inc) know
their spirits were still alive!\add* All \add people\add* whose \add spirits\add* are alive
\add again after they die continue to live to honor him\add*!” 
\p
\v 39 Some of the men who taught the \add Jewish\add* laws replied, “Teacher,
you\add (sg)\add* have answered very well!” 
\v 40 After that, they no longer dared to ask him any more questions
\add like that to try to trap him\add*. 
\s Luke 20:41-44 (Mt. 22:41-45; Mk. 12:35-37) 
\s Jesus showed them that the Messiah must be greater than King David.
\p
\v 41  \add Later\add* he said to them, “◄I will show you \f + \ft (OR, prove to you) that people
\add are wrong who\add* say that the Messiah is \add merely\add* a descendant of
\add King\add* David!/Why do people say that the Messiah is \add merely\add* a descendant of
\add King\add* David?► \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* 
\v 42 Because David himself wrote in the book of Psalms \add about the
Messiah\add*, 
\q God said to my Lord, 
\q Sit \add here beside me\add* on my right, \add where I will highly honor
you(sg)\add* \f + \fk metonymy \f*. 
\v 43  \add Sit here\add* while I completely defeat your enemies.
\p
\v 44 King David calls \add the Messiah\add* ‘\add my\add* Lord’! So
◄\add the Messiah\add* cannot be \add just someone\add* descended from
\add King\add* David!/how can the Messiah be \add just\add* someone descended from
\add King\add* David?► \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* \add What I just said proves that he is much greater than David, isn't that
right?\add*” 
\s Luke 20:45-47 (Mt. 23:1-36; Mk. 12:38-40) \f* 
\s Jesus warned them not to show off like the teachers of the Jewish laws did.
\p
\v 45 While all the \add other\add* people were listening, \add Jesus\add* said to his disciples,
\v 46 “Beware that \add you do not act like\add* the men who teach our
\add Jewish\add* laws. They like to put on long robes and walk around
\add to make people think that they are very important\add*. \add They\add* also like
\add people to\add* greet them \add respectfully\add* in the marketplaces. They like
\add to sit in\add* the most important places in the Jewish meeting places. At dinner parties
\add they like to sit in\add* the seats where the most honored people sit.
\v 47 They swindle \f + \fk metaphor \f* the houses \add and property\add* of widows.
\add Then\add* they pretend they are good, as they pray \add long\add* prayers
\add publicly. God\add* will \add certainly\add* punish them very severely.”
