\c 12  
\s Luke 12:1-3 
\s Jesus warned the people not to be like the Pharisees. 
\p
\v 1 While they were doing that, many thousands of people gathered
\add around Jesus\add*. There were so many that they were stepping on each other. Then he said to his disciples, “Beware of
\add becoming\add* hypocrites \add like\add* the Pharisees. Their
\add evil influence\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add spreads to others like\add* yeast
\add spreads its influence in dough\add*. 
\v 2 People will not be able to continue concealing the things that
\add they or other\add* people try to conceal now. \add God\add* will
\add some day\add* cause the things that are hidden now to be known
{\add everyone\add* to know the things that they hide now}. 
\v 3 All the things that you say in the dark \add secretly, some
day\add* will be heard {people will hear them} in the daylight. The things you have whispered \f + \ft synecdoche \f* among yourselves in your
rooms will be proclaimed {\add people\add* will proclaim them} publicly.”
\s Luke 12:4-12 
\s Jesus told them not to be afraid to tell others of their faith in him.
\p
\v 4 “My friends, listen \add carefully\add*! Do not be afraid of people who
\add are able to\add* kill you, but after they kill you, there is nothing more that they can do
\add to hurt you\add*! 
\v 5 But I will warn you about the one that you should truly be afraid of. You should be afraid of
\add God\add*, because he not only has \add the power to\add* cause people to die, he has the power to throw them into hell
afterward! Yes, he is truly the one that you should be afraid of!
\v 6  \add Think about\add* the sparrows. \add They have so little
value\add* that \add you\add* can \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* buy five of them for only two small coins. But not one of them is ever forgotten by God
{God never forgets one of them}! 
\v 7 You are more valuable \add to God\add* than many sparrows. So do not be afraid
\add of what people can do to you\add*! \add God\add* even knows how many hairs there are on each of your heads,
\add so that if you(sg) lose one hair, he knows about it. So nothing bad can happen to you without his knowing
it\add*. 
\p
\v 8 I want to tell you also that if people, \add without being afraid, are willing
to\add* tell others \add that they are my disciples\add*, \add I\add*, the one who came from heaven, will acknowledge before
\add God that they are my disciples\add*. \add I will do that while\add* God's angels listen.
\v 9 But if they \add are\add* afraid to say in front of others that they are
\add my disciples\add*, \add I\add* will say while God's angels listen, that they are not
\add my disciples\add*. 
\v 10  \add I will tell you\add* also that \add God is willing to\add* forgive people who say bad things about me, the one who
came from heaven, but \add he\add* will not forgive anyone who says evil things about what the Holy Spirit
\add does\add*. 
\v 11  \add So\add* when people ask you in Jewish worship houses and in the presence of rulers and other authorities
\add about your trusting in me\add*, do not worry about how you will answer them
\add when they accuse you\add*. Do not worry about what you should say,
\v 12 because the Holy Spirit will tell you at that very time what you should say.”
\s Luke 12:13-21 
\s Jesus warned them about being greedy. 
\p
\v 13 Then one of the people in the crowd said to \add Jesus\add*, “Teacher, tell my
\add older\add* brother to divide my father's property and give me
\add the part that belongs\add* to me!” 
\v 14 But Jesus replied to him, “Man, ◄no one appointed me in order that I would settle
\add matters when people are\add* disputing about property!\f + \ft Or: did \f* anyone appoint me in order that I would settle
\add matters when people are\add* disputing about property?► \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*”
\v 15 Then he said to the whole crowd, “Guard yourselves very carefully, in order that you do not desire other people's things
in any way! No one can make his life secure by \add obtaining\add* many possessions.”
\p
\v 16 Then he told them this illustration: “There was a certain rich man in whose fields abundant crops grew.
\v 17  \add So\add* he said \add to himself\add*, ‘I do not know what to do, because I do not have any place
\add big enough\add* to store all my crops!’ 
\v 18 Then he said to himself, ‘\add I know\add* what I will do! I will tear down my grain bins and then build larger ones!
Then I will store all my wheat and other goods in \add the big new
bins\add*. 
\v 19  \add Then\add* I will say to myself \f + \ft synecdoche \f*, “Now I have plenty of things stored up.
\add They will last\add* for many years. \add So now\add* I will take life easy. I will eat and drink
\add all that I want to\add* and be happy \add for a long time\add*!”’
\v 20 But God said to him, ‘You foolish \add man\add*! Tonight you will die! ◄Then all
\add the goods\add* you have saved up \add for yourself\add* will
\add belong to someone else, not to\add* you!\f + \ft Or: Do \f* you think that you
\add will benefit from\add* all that you have stored up for yourself?► \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*’”
\p
\v 21  \add Then Jesus ended this illustration by saying\add*, “That is what will happen to those who store up goods just for
themselves, but who do not value the things \add that\add* God \add considers\add* valuable.”
\s Luke 12:22-34 
\s Jesus told his disciples not to worry about the things that they need.
\p
\v 22 Then \add Jesus\add* said to his disciples, “So I want to tell you this: Do not worry about
\add things you need\add* in order to live. Do not worry about \add whether you will have enough
food\add* to eat or\add enough clothes\add* to wear. 
\v 23 It is important to have sufficient food and clothing, but ◄the way you conduct your lives is more important.\f + \ft Or: is \f* not the
way you conduct your lives more important?► \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* 
\v 24 Think about the birds: They do not plant \add seeds\add*, and they do not harvest
\add crops\add*. They do not have rooms or buildings in which to store crops. But God provides food for them.
\add And\add* you are certainly much more valuable than birds. \add So God will certainly provide what you
need!\add* 
\v 25 ◄There is not a one of you who can add a little bit to how long he lives by worrying about it!\f + \ft Or: Is \f* there any of you who
can add a little bit to how long he lives by worrying about it?► \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 26 That is a small thing to do. So since you cannot do that, ◄you certainly should not worry about other things that
\add you need to have in order to live!\add*\f + \ft Or: why \f* do you worry about other things that
\add you need to have in order to live\add*?► \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* 
\v 27 Think about the way that flowers grow \add in the fields\add*. They do not work
\add to earn money\add*, and they do not make their own clothes. But I tell you that
\add even though King\add* Solomon, \add who lived long ago, wore very beautiful
clothes\add*, his clothes were not as beautiful as one of those \add flowers\add*.
\v 28 God makes the flowers beautiful, but they grow in the fields for only a short time. Then
\add they are cut at the same time that the other grass\add* is cut, and thrown into an oven
\add to be burned to make heat for baking\add* bread. \add So they really are not worth very much. But you are very precious
to\add* God, \add and he\add* will \add care for you\add* much more
\add than he cares for the grass by filling it with beautiful flowers\add*. So he will certainly provide clothes for you, who
\add live much longer than the grass. Why\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add do you\add* trust him so little?
\v 29 Do not always be concerned about having enough to eat and drink, and do not be worrying about those things.
\v 30 The people who do not know God are always worried about such things. But your Father
\add in heaven\add* knows that you need those things, \add so you should not worry about
them\add*. 
\v 31 Instead, be concerned about letting \add God\add* completely direct
\add your life\add*. Then \add he\add* will also give you enough of the things
\add you need\add*. 
\p
\v 32  \add You who are my disciples are like a\add* small flock of sheep,
\add and I am like your shepherd\add*. So you should not be afraid. Your Father
\add in heaven\add* wants to let you rule with him \add in heaven\add*.
\v 33  \add So now\add* sell the things that you own. Give \add the money that you get for those
things\add* to poor people. \add If you do that, it will be as though\add* you are providing for yourselves purses that will
not wear out, and \add God will give\add* you a treasure in heaven that will always be safe. There, no thief can come near
\add to steal it\add*, and no termite can destroy it. 
\v 34 Remember that \add the things\add* that you \add think are the
most\add* valuable are \add the things\add* that you will be constantly concerned about.”
\s Luke 12:35-48 
\s Jesus told them that they should be ready for his return. 
\p
\v 35 “Be always ready \add for doing God's work\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, like
\add people\add* who have put on their work clothes and are ready
\add during the day\add*, with their lamps burning all night. 
\v 36 Be \add ready for me to return\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, like servants who are waiting for their master to return after being at a
wedding feast \add for several days\add*. They are \add waiting to\add* open the door for him and
\add start working for him again\add* as soon as he arrives and knocks at the door.
\v 37 If those servants are awake when he returns, \add he will\add* be very pleased with them. I will tell you this: He will
put on \add the kind of clothes\add* that servants wear and tell them to sit down, and he will serve them a meal.
\v 38  \add Even\add* if he comes between midnight and sunrise, if he finds that his servants are
\add awake and\add* ready \add for him\add*, he will be very pleased with them.
\v 39 But you must also remember this: If owners of a house knew what time the thief was coming, they
\add would stay awake and\add* would not allow the house to be broken into
\add and their goods to be stolen\add* {\add the thief\add* to break into the house
\add and steal their goods\add*}. 
\v 40 Similarly, you must be ready \add for me to return\add*, because
\add I\add*, the one who came from heaven, will come \add again\add* at a time when you do not expect
\add me to come\add*.” 
\p
\v 41 Peter said, “Lord, are you\add (sg)\add* speaking this illustration
\add only\add* for us or for everyone \add else also\add*?” 
\v 42 The Lord replied, “\add I am saying it for you and for anyone
else\add* \f + \ft metaphor, rhetorical question \f* who is like a faithful and wise manager in his master's house. His master appoints him to
\add supervise affairs in his house\add* and to give all the \add other\add* servants their food at the proper time.
\add Then he leaves on a long trip\add*. 
\v 43 If the servant is doing that work when his master returns,
\add his master\add* will be very pleased with him. 
\v 44 I tell you this: His master will appoint him to supervise all of his affairs
\add permanently\add*. 
\v 45 But that servant might say to himself, ‘My master \add has been
away\add* for a long time, \add so he probably will\add* not return
soon\add and find out what I am doing\add*.’ \add Then he might\add* start to beat the
\add other\add* servants, both male and female ones. \add He might also
start\add* to eat \add a lot of food\add* and get drunk. 
\v 46  \add If he does that, and if\add* his master returns on a day that he does not know about, at a time when the servant
does not expect him, then his master will cut him into two pieces\f + \ft Or: punish him severely \f* \f + \ft hyperbole \f* and put him
\add in the place where he puts all\add* those who do not \add serve
him\add* faithfully. 
\v 47 Every servant who knows what his master wants him to do but who does not get himself ready and does not do what his
master desires will be beaten severely {\add The master\add* will beat severely every servant who knows what his master wants
him to do but who does not get himself ready and does not do what his master desires}.
\v 48 But every \add servant\add* who did not know \add what his master
wanted\add* him to do, and who did things for which he deserved to be punished, will be beaten lightly
{\add the master\add* will beat lightly every \add servant\add* who did not know
\add what his master wanted\add* him to do and did the things for which he deserved that
\add his master\add* would beat him}. \add God will treat his people similarly, because
he\add* expects a lot from those people whom \add he\add* has allowed
\add to understand a lot\add*. People who entrust things \add to others'
care\add* expect those people\add to care for those things\add* very well. Similarly,
\add God\add* expects a lot from those people whom he has allowed
\add to understand a lot\add*. Furthermore, he expects the most from people to whom he has given the most
\add ability\add*.” 
\s Luke 12:49-53 
\s Jesus warned them that they would face opposition even within their own families.
\p
\v 49 “I came to earth to bring \add trials\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add which will separate and purify you
as\add* fire \add purifies metal\add* \f + \ft Or: to cause judgment( Or: divisions ) \f*. I wish that the time when
\add you\add* will be purified {when \add God\add* will purify you} \f + \ft Or: when divisions will be caused {to cause divisions
among people} \f* had already begun. 
\v 50 I must soon suffer \f + \ft idiom \f* greatly. I am distressed, and I will continue to be distressed until my suffering is finished.
\v 51 Do you think that as a result of my coming to earth people will live together peacefully? No! I must tell you,
\add that is not what will happen! Instead, people\add* will be divided.
\v 52 Because some people in one house \add will believe in me and some will
not\add*, they will be divided. Three people in one house \add who do not believe in
me\add* will oppose two \add who do believe\add*, or two \add who do not believe in
me\add* will oppose three \add who do believe\add*. 
\v 53 A man will oppose his son, or a son will oppose his father. A woman will oppose her daughter, or a woman will oppose her
mother. A woman will oppose her daughter-in-law, or a woman will oppose her mother-in-law.”
\s Luke 12:54-59 
\s Jesus told the people that they needed to settle their relationship with God before it was too late.
\p
\v 54 He \add also\add* said to the crowds, “\add In this country\add*, when you see a
\add dark\add* cloud forming in the west, you immediately say ‘It is going to rain!’ and that is what happens.
\v 55  \add In this region\add*, when the wind blows from the south, you say, ‘It is going to be a very hot day!’ and that is
what happens. 
\v 56 You hypocrites! By observing the clouds and the wind, you are able to discern what is happening regarding
\add the weather\add*. It is disgusting that you are not able to discern
\add what God is doing\add* at this present time \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*! 
\p
\v 57 ◄Each of you ought to determine now what is the right thing for you to do,
\add while you still have time to do that\add*!\f + \ft Or: Why \f* cannot each of you determine what is the right
\add thing for you to do now while you still have time to do that\add*?► \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 58  \add If you do not do that, God will punish you\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\add It will be like what happens when\add* someone takes one of you to court, saying that
you\add (sg)\add* have done something very bad. You should try to settle things with him while you are still on the way to the
court. If he forces you to go to the judge, the judge will decide that you are guilty and put you into the hands of the court
officer. Then that officer will put you in prison. 
\v 59 I tell you that if you go to prison, you will never get out,
\add because you will never be able to\add* pay every bit \add of what the judge says you
owe\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. \add Similarly, you ought to settle accounts with God before you die,
too\add*.”
