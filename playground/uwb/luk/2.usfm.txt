\s Luke 2:1-7 
\s Jesus was born in Bethlehem. 
\p
\v 1 About that time the Emperor Augustus commanded that \add his officials
must\add* write down the names\f + \ft Or: \add a census be taken\add* \f* of all the people who lived in countries
\add controlled\add* by the Roman \add government\add* {that the Roman
\add government controlled\add*}, \add so that the government could collect taxes from
them\add*. 
\v 2 That was the first time that they wrote down the names\f + \ft Or: took a census \f* in Syria
\add province, which included Judea district\add*. They did this while Quirinius was the governor of the province.
\v 3 Every person had to go to the town where his \add most famous
ancestor\add* had lived, so that \add the officials\add* could write down their names.
\v 4 So, because Joseph was a descendant of \add King\add* David, he went up from Nazareth, the town in Galilee
\add district where he lived\add*, to Bethlehem town in Judea \add district\add*. That was the town where
\add King\add* David \add grew up\add*. 
\v 5 Joseph went with Mary, who \add was considered\add* {whom \add people
considered\add*} \add to be\add* his wife, who was now pregnant. They went so that they could put his name and Mary's name
\add in the record book\add*. 
\v 6-7 When they arrived \add in Bethlehem\add*, there was no place for them to stay in the house where travelers stay.
\add So they stayed in a cattle shed\add*. When the time for Mary to give birth arrived, she gave birth to her first son there.
She wrapped him in strips of cloth and placed him in a trough where
\add people\add* put food for the animals. 
\s Luke 2:8-20 
\s Responding to the angel's announcement, shepherds went to see Jesus.
\p
\v 8 That night, there were \add some\add* shepherds who were taking care of their sheep
\add as usual\add* in the fields near \add Bethlehem\add*. 
\v 9 An angel from God appeared to them. A great light from the Lord\f + \ft Or: from God \f* shone on them and around them.
\add So\add* they became very afraid. 
\v 10 But the angel said to them, "Do not be afraid! I have come to tell you good news, which will
\add make you\add* very happy! This message is for everyone \add to
hear\add*! 
\v 11  \add The message is that\add* today a baby has been born in
\add Bethlehem, the town where King\add* David grew up. That baby will
\add eventually\add* save you \add from the guilt of your sins!\add* He is the Messiah,
\add your\add* Lord! 
\v 12 I will tell you how \add you will recognize him\add* \f + \ft Or: how you will know
\add that what I say is true\add* \f*: \add In Bethlehem\add* you will find a baby who has been wrapped
{\add whose mother\add* has wrapped him} in strips of cloth and placed in a trough where
\add people\add* put food for the animals." 
\p
\v 13 Suddenly a large group of angels from heaven appeared and joined the other angel. They all praised God, singing\f + \ft Or: saying \f*,
\v 14 "May \add all the angels\add* in the highest heaven praise God! And on the earth may the people to whom God has shown his
favor have peace \add with him\add*!" 
\p
\v 15 After the angels left them \add and returned\add* to heaven, the shepherds said to each other, "Let's go to Bethlehem to
see this \add wonderful\add* thing that has happened, which the Lord\f + \ft Or: God \f* has told us about!"
\v 16 So they went quickly. They found the \add place where\add* Mary and Joseph
\add were staying\add*, and \add they saw\add* the baby lying in the trough where
\add people\add* put food for the animals. 
\v 17 Then they told \add Mary and Joseph and others\add* what had been told them {what
\add the angel\add* had told them} about this child. 
\v 18 Everyone who heard what was said by the shepherds {what the shepherds said} to them was amazed.
\v 19 But Mary \add did not talk to others about what the angels
said\add*; she just kept thinking very much about it. 
\v 20 The shepherds returned \add to their sheep\add*. They kept praising God very much for all the things that they had heard
and seen, \add because\add* everything \add happened\add* exactly like
\add the angels\add* told them. 
\s Luke 2:21-24 
\s They circumcised Jesus and presented him to the Lord. 
\p
\v 21 Seven days later, when \add the priests\add* circumcised the baby,
\add his parents\add* named him Jesus. That was the name that \add they were told
by\add* the angel {the angel \add told them\add*} \add to\add* give him before Mary became pregnant.
\p
\v 22-23 It had been written by Moses {Moses had written} \add long
ago\add* in a law that God gave him, that when a woman gave birth to her first son, the parents had to take him
\add to the Temple\add* in Jerusalem in order that they might dedicate him to the Lord\f + \ft Or: to God \f*. So when the time came for them
to do those rituals so that \add God would consider\add* them pure again, Mary and Joseph took Jesus there.
\v 24 God had commanded in his laws that if the first child \add of a
couple\add* was a boy, his parents should offer as a sacrifice to God two turtledoves or two young pigeons.
\add So Joseph and Mary gave the priest two birds so he could offer
them\add*. 
\s Luke 2:25-35 
\s Simeon prophesied about what Jesus would do. 
\p
\v 25 At that time there was an \add old\add* man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon. He habitually did what was pleasing to
God and he obeyed God's laws. The Holy Spirit was \add directing\add* him as he was waiting for
\add God\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add to\add* encourage the Israelite \add people by sending the
Messiah\add*. 
\v 26 It was \add previously\add* revealed by the Holy Spirit {The Holy Spirit
\add previously\add* revealed} to him that he would see God's \add promised\add* Messiah before he died.
\v 27 When Joseph and Mary brought their baby Jesus \add to the Temple\add* in order to perform the rituals that
\add God had commanded\add* in his laws, the Spirit led Simeon to enter the Temple
\add courtyard, and revealed to him that Jesus was the Messiah\add*.
\v 28 So he took Jesus up in his arms and praised God, saying, 
\q
\v 29-32 Lord, you promised me that I would see the one \f + \ft metonymy \f* who would enable you to save people of all people-groups from the
guilt of their sins. He will be \f + \ft metaphor \f* like a light that will reveal your truth to non-Jews, and he will cause people to think
highly of your people, the Israelite people. Since I \f + \ft synecdoche \f* have now seen this one that you promised to send, now let me die
peacefully. 
\p
\v 33 His parents marveled about what \add Simeon\add* said about
\add Jesus\add*. Then Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary, 
\v 34 "Note what I say: \add God\add* has determined that because of this child, many Israelite people will
\add turn away from God\add*, and many others will turn to God \f + \ft metaphor \f*. Although he will be like a sign \f + \ft metaphor \f*
\add to warn people\add*, \add many\add* people will oppose him.
\v 35 As a result, the \add evil\add* thoughts of many people will be made evident {he will reveal the
\add evil\add* thoughts of many people}. \add Furthermore, the cruel things that they will do to
him\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add will be like\add* a sword that will pierce your soul\f + \ft Or: inner being \f*."
\s Luke 2:36-38 
\s Anna praised God for Jesus and told others about him. 
\p
\v 36 There was also \add in the Temple courtyard\add* a very old woman named Anna. She was a prophetess. Her father Phanuel
was a member of the tribe of Asher. After she had been married seven years, her husband died.
\v 37 After that, she lived until she was eighty-four years old, and she was still a widow. She stayed in the Temple
\add area\add* all the time, night and day, worshipping God. She often abstained from food\f + \ft Or: fasted \f* as she prayed.
\v 38  \add While Joseph and Mary and the baby were\add* still \add in the Temple, Anna came to them. She thanked God for the
baby\add*. Then she spoke about Jesus to many people who were expecting
\add God to send the Messiah\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* to set \add the people of\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* Jerusalem free
\add from their enemies\add*. 
\s Luke 2:39-40 
\s Jesus grew up in Nazareth. 
\p
\v 39 After Joseph and Mary had finished performing the rituals that the Lord\f + \ft Or: God \f* required
\add the parents of a first son\add* to perform, they returned to their own town, Nazareth, in Galilee
\add district\add*. 
\v 40 As the child grew up, he became strong and very wise, and God was very pleased with him.
\s Luke 2:41-52 
\s What Jesus did in the Temple when he was a boy. 
\p
\v 41 Every year Jesus' parents went to Jerusalem to \add celebrate\add* the Passover festival.
\v 42 So when Jesus was twelve years old, they went up \add to Jerusalem\add* as they always did.
\v 43 When the celebration ended, his parents started to return home, but Jesus stayed in Jerusalem.
\add His parents\add* did not realize that \add Jesus stayed there\add*.
\v 44 They thought that he was with the other people who were traveling with them. They walked all day. Then they started to
look for him among their relatives and friends. 
\v 45 They did not find him, so they returned to Jerusalem to search for him.
\v 46 Two days later, they found him. He was in the Temple \add courtyard\add*, sitting with the
\add Jewish\add* religious teachers. He was listening to what they said, and he was asking them questions.
\v 47 Everyone who heard what he \add said\add* was amazed at how much he understood and
\add how well\add* he answered \add the questions that the teachers
asked\add*. 
\v 48 When his parents saw him, they were very surprised. His mother said to him, "My son, why have you done this to us? Your
father and I have been very worried as we\add (exc)\add* have been searching for you!"
\v 49 He said to them, \add speaking about the Temple being God his Father's
house\add*, "I am surprised that you\add (dl)\add* did \add not
know\add* where to find me!\f + \ft Or: Why did you \add not know\add* where to find me? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
You\add (dl)\add* should have known that it was necessary for me to be in my Father's house!\f + \ft Or: Did you not know that it was
necessary for me to be in my Father's house? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*" 
\v 50 But they did not understand \add the meaning of\add* what he said to them.
\v 51 Then he returned with them down to Nazareth. He always obeyed them. But his mother kept thinking about all those things.
\p
\v 52  \add As the years passed\add*, Jesus continued to become wiser and he grew taller. God and people continued to approve
of him more and more.
