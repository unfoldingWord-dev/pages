\v 1-2 My noble \add friend\add* Theophilus, many people saw the things that
\add Jesus\add* did while he was with us, from the time when he started \f + \fk metonymy \f*
\add his ministry\add*. They served God \add by teaching people\add* the
message\add about the Lord Jesus\add*. Many of those who heard what they taught wrote down for us accounts of the things that
\add Jesus did from the time when\add* he began\add his ministry\add*.
\v 3 I myself have studied carefully these accounts. So I decided that it would be good for me also to write for
you\add (sg)\add* an accurate account of these matters. 
\v 4 I want you to know the truth about what you have been taught {what others have taught you}.
\s Luke 1:5-25 
\s An angel told Zechariah that his wife Elizabeth would bear a son, John.
\p
\v 5 When King Herod \add the Great ruled\add* Judea \add district\add*, there was a
\add Jewish\add* priest named Zechariah. He belonged to the \add group of priests
called\add* the Abijah group. He and his wife Elizabeth were both descended from the
\add first priest of Israel\add*, Aaron. 
\v 6  \add God considered that\add* both of them were righteous, because they constantly obeyed without fault everything that
God had commanded. 
\v 7 But they had no children, because Elizabeth was unable to bear children. Furthermore, she and her husband were very old.
\p
\v 8 One day \add Zechariah's\add* group was doing their work \add in the Temple in
Jerusalem\add*, and he was serving as a priest in God's presence.
\v 9 Following their custom, \add the other priests\add* chose him by lot to enter the Lord's temple and burn incense.
\v 10 While he was burning the incense, many people were outside
\add in the courtyard\add*, praying. 
\v 11 Then an angel whom God had \add sent\add* appeared to him. The angel was standing at the right side of the place
\add where the priests burned\add* incense. 
\v 12 When Zechariah saw the angel, he was startled and became very afraid.
\v 13 But the angel said to him, “Zechariah, do not be afraid! When
you\add (sg)\add* prayed \add asking God for a son\add* \f + \ft (OR, \add that God would send the
Messiah\add*), God heard what you prayed. \add So\add* your wife Elizabeth shall bear a son for you. You must name him John.
\v 14 He will cause you to be very happy, and many other people will also be happy because he is born.
\v 15 God will consider him to be very important. He must never drink wine or any other alcoholic drink,
\add in order that he will be completely dedicated to God\add*. He will be controlled by the Holy Spirit {The Holy Spirit will
control him} from before he is born. 
\v 16 He will \add persuade\add* many people in Israel to turn away
\add from their sins and please\add* the Lord their God. 
\v 17 As \add God's\add* Spirit enables him \add to preach\add* powerfully as
\add the prophet\add* Elijah did, he will precede \add the Messiah\add*. He will cause parents \f + \fk synecdoche \f* to act
\add peacefully\add* toward their children \add again\add*. He will cause
\add many\add* people who do not obey \add God to hear and obey\add* the wise things that righteous people
\add tell them\add*. He will do this in order to make \add many\add* people to be ready when the Lord
\add comes\add*.” 
\p
\v 18 Then Zechariah said to the angel, “I am very old, and my wife is also so old
\add that she cannot bear a child. So\add* ◄I cannot \add believe\add* that what
you\add (sg)\add* said \add will happen\add*!/how can I \add believe\add* that what
you\add (sg)\add* said \add will happen\add*?► \f + \fk rhetorical question \f*” 
\p
\v 19 Then the angel said to him, “I am \add God's chief angel\add*, Gabriel!
\add I do what God tells me, because\add* I constantly stand in God's presence! I was sent
{\add He\add* sent me} to tell you\add (sg)\add* this good message
\add about what will happen to you\add*. 
\v 20 What I have told you will certainly happen at the time \add God
decides\add*, but you did not believe my words. So now \add God will
cause\add* that you will be unable to talk until the day \add your son is
born!\add*” 
\p
\v 21 While \add Zechariah and the angel\add* were talking, the people
\add in the courtyard\add* were waiting for Zechariah \add to come
out\add*. They wondered, “Why is he staying in the Temple for such a long time?”
\v 22 When he came out, he was not able to speak to them. Because he could not talk, he made motions with his hands
\add to try to convey what had happened\add*. Then they realized that he had seen ◄a vision
\add from God\add*/something that \add God\add* showed him► while he was in the Temple.
\p
\v 23 When Zechariah's time to work \add as a priest in the Temple\add* was finished, he
\add left Jerusalem and\add* returned to his home. 
\p
\v 24 Some time later his wife Elizabeth became pregnant \f + \fk euphemism \f*. She did not go out of her house for five months,
\add because she knew that people would laugh at her during that time if she told them that she was
pregnant\add*. 
\v 25 But she said to herself, “God has enabled me to become pregnant. At this time he has pitied me and has caused that I will
no longer be ashamed \add because I have no children\add*!” 
\s Luke 1:26-38 
\s An angel told a virgin named Mary that she would bear a son, to be named Jesus.
\p
\v 26 When Elizabeth had been \add pregnant\add* \f + \fk euphemism \f* \add for almost\add* six months, the angel Gabriel was sent by God {God
sent the angel Gabriel} \add again\add*. 
\v 27  \add This time\add* he went to Nazareth \add town\add* in Galilee
\add district\add*, to a virgin whose name was Mary. It had been
{\add Her parents\add* had} promised that she would marry a man named Joseph, who was descended from
\add King\add* David. 
\v 28 The angel said to her, “Greetings! ◄The Lord/God► is with you\add (sg)\add* and you will be greatly blessed
{\add has decided to\add* greatly bless you}!” 
\v 29 But Mary was greatly confused \add when she heard\add* that. She wondered what
\add the angel meant\add* by these words. 
\v 30 Then the angel said to her, “Mary, God is very pleased with
you\add (sg)\add*, so do not be afraid. 
\v 31 You will become pregnant and bear a son, and you must name him Jesus.
\v 32 He will become great. He will be called {\add People will\add* call him} ◄the Son of God/the man who is also God►. God,
the Lord, will make him a king \f + \fk metonymy \f* as his ancestor \add King\add* David was.
\v 33 He will be the King of \add the\add* Jews, the descendants \f + \fk metonymy \f* of
\add your ancestor\add* Jacob, forever. He will rule as king forever!”
\p
\v 34 Then Mary said to the angel, “I am a virgin, so how can I \add have a
baby\add*?” 
\v 35 The angel replied, “The Holy Spirit will come to you\add (sg)\add* and the power of God [MTY/EUP] will be on you
\add to enable you to become pregnant\add*. So the child \add you
will\add* bear will be completely set apart {give himself completely} to obey God, and he will be called
{\add people\add* will say that he is} ◄the Son of God/the man who is also God►.
\v 36  \add I also need to tell you something else\add*. Your cousin Elizabeth is very old, and it was thought
{\add people\add* said} that she could not bear any children. But she has been
\add pregnant\add* \f + \fk euphemism \f* \add for almost\add* six months, and will bear a son!
\v 37  \add You should not be surprised at that\add*, because God can do everything!”
\v 38 Then Mary said, “All right, I want to serve ◄the Lord/God►, so may what
you\add (sg)\add* have said about me come true!” Then the angel left her.
\s Luke 1:39-45 
\s Mary visited Elizabeth. 
\p
\v 39 Very soon after that, Mary got ready and went quickly to a town in the highlands of Judea
\add district\add* where Zechariah lived. 
\v 40 She entered his house and greeted \add his wife\add* Elizabeth.
\v 41 As soon as Elizabeth heard Mary greet her, the baby leaped inside
\add Elizabeth's\add* womb. The Holy Spirit took complete control of Elizabeth,
\v 42 and she said loudly \add to Mary\add*, “\add God\add* has blessed you
\add more than\add* he has blessed \add any other\add* woman, and
\add he has\add* blessed the child you will bear! 
\v 43 ◄I am not worthy that \add God would allow you\add* to visit me!/Why is
\add God allowing you\add* to visit me?► \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* You will be the mother of my Lord!
\v 44  \add I realize this because\add* as soon as I heard you greet me, the baby inside my womb leaped because he was so happy
\add that you had come\add*! 
\v 45  \add God\add* is pleased with you \add because\add* you believed that what ◄the Lord/God► told you would come true.”
\s Luke 1:46-56 
\s Mary praised God. 
\p
\v 46 Then Mary \add praised God by\add* saying/singing: 
\q O, how I \f + \fk synecdoche \f* praise ◄the Lord/God►! 
\q
\v 47 I rejoice in my inner being because God is the one who saves me.
\q
\v 48 I was only his lowly servant girl, but he did not forget me.
\q So from now on, people living in all ◄ages/future time► will say that God was pleased with me,
\q
\v 49 because they will hear about the things that God \f + \fk metonymy \f*, the mighty one, has done for me.
\q He \f + \fk metonymy \f* is awesome! 
\q
\v 50 He acts mercifully from one generation to the next toward those who respect him.
\q
\v 51 He shows people that he \f + \fk metonymy \f* is very powerful. He scatters those who think proudly within their inner beings.
\q
\v 52 He sends mighty kings away and does not let them rule \f + \fk metonymy \f* anymore, but he honors the people who are oppressed (OR,
humble). 
\q
\v 53 He gives good things to eat to those who are hungry, but he sends away the rich people without giving them anything.
\q
\v 54-55 He promised to Abraham and all our other ancestors who descended from him that he would act mercifully toward them
forever. 
\q And now he has remembered what he promised. 
\q So he has helped me and all the other people of \f + \fk metonymy \f* Israel who serve him.
\p
\v 56 Mary stayed with Elizabeth for about three months. Then she returned to her home.
\s Luke 1:57-66 
\s What happened when John was born. 
\p
\v 57 When it was time for Elizabeth to bear her child, she bore a son.
\v 58 Her neighbors and relatives heard how ◄the Lord/God► had greatly blessed her, so they were happy along with
\add Elizabeth\add*. 
\v 59 Seven days later they gathered together for the \add ceremony
for\add* circumcising the baby \add to show that he belonged to God\add*. Since his father's name was Zechariah, they wanted to
give the baby the same name. 
\v 60 But his mother said, “No, \add his name will not be Zechariah\add*. His name will be John!”
\v 61  \add So\add* they said to her, “\add John\add* is not the name of any of
your\add (dl)\add* relatives, \add so you(dl) should not give him that
name\add*!” 
\v 62 Then they made motions with their hands to his father, \add for
him\add* to indicate what name \add he\add* wanted to be given {to give} to his son.
\v 63  \add So\add* he signaled that they \add should give him\add* a tablet
\add to write on. When they gave him one\add*, he wrote \add on it\add*, “His name is John.” All those
\add who were there\add* were surprised! 
\v 64 Immediately Zechariah was able to speak again \f + \fk metonymy \f*, and he praised God.
\v 65 All their neighbors were amazed/awestruck! They told other people who lived all over the highlands of Judea about what
had happened. 
\v 66 Everyone who heard about it kept thinking about it. They were saying, “We wonder what work
\add the child\add* will do \add for God when\add* he \add grows
up\add* \f + \fk rhetorical question \f*!” They wondered that because \add from what had happened they were sure
that\add* God would be helping him \f + \fk synecdoche \f* \add in a powerful way\add*.
\s Luke 1:67-80 
\s Zechariah praised God and predicted what his son would do. 
\q
\v 67  \add After\add* Zechariah's \add son was born\add*, Zechariah was completely directed by the Holy Spirit {the Holy
Spirit completely directed Zechariah} as he spoke these words that came from God:
\q
\v 68 Praise the Lord, the God whom we(inc) people of Israel worship,
\q because he has come to set us, his people, free from our enemies.
\q
\v 69 He is sending us someone who will powerfully \f + \fk metonymy \f* save us,
\q someone who is descended from \f + \fk metonymy \f* King David, 
\q who served God well. 
\q
\v 70 Long ago God caused his prophets to say that he would do that.
\q
\v 71 He will rescue us from our enemies, 
\q and he will save us from the power of all those who hate us. 
\q
\v 72 He will do this because he has not forgotten what he promised our ancestors;
\q he made an agreement that he would act mercifully to us, their descendants.
\q
\v 73 That is what he strongly promised our ancestor Abraham that he would do.
\q
\v 74 God told him that we would be rescued {he would rescue us} from the power of our enemies,
\q that he would enable us to serve him without being afraid, 
\q
\v 75 that he would cause us to be completely dedicated to him, 
\q and enable us to live righteously all of our lives. 
\p
\v 76  \add Then Zechariah said this to\add* his little son: 
\q My child, you will be called {people will say that you are} a prophet
\q whom God [MTY/EUP] has sent; 
\q you will begin your work before ◄the Lord/Messiah► comes; 
\q you will prepare people so that they will be ready for him. 
\q (OR, you will begin your work before the Messiah comes) \f*. 
\q
\v 77 You will tell God's people how he will forgive them and save them from being punished for their sins.
\q
\v 78 Our God will do that because he is very kind to us. 
\q Just like a new day begins when the sun rises \f + \fk metaphor \f*, 
\q God will do that new thing for us when the Messiah comes to us from heaven.
\q
\v 79 People who do not know God \f + \fk metaphor \f* are like those who sit in the darkness.
\q They are afraid \f + \fk metonymy \f* that they will soon die. 
\q But when the Messiah tells us God's message, 
\q it will be like causing such people to see a bright light. 
\q He will guide us \f + \fk synecdoche \f* so that we will be living peacefully. 
\p
\v 80  \add Later\add*, Zechariah's son grew up and became spiritually strong. Then he lived in a desolate region until he
began to preach to the Israelite people.
