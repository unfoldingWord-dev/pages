\c 13  
\s Luke 13:1-5 
\s Jesus warned the people that God would punish them if they did not turn from their sinful lives.
\p
\v 1 Some people who were \add listening to Jesus\add* at that time told him about some people from Galilee
\add district who had gone to Jerusalem\add*. Pilate, \add the Roman
governor\add*, had \add ordered soldiers to\add* kill them \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* while they were offering sacrifices
\add in the Temple there\add*. 
\v 2 Jesus replied to them, “Do you think \add that this happened to
those\add* people from Galilee \add because\add* they were more sinful than all the other people from Galilee?
\v 3 I assure you, \add that was\add* not\add so!\add* But instead of
\add being concerned about them, you need to remember that God\add* will similarly punish you
\add eternally\add* if you do not turn from your sinful behavior.
\v 4 Or, \add consider\add* the eighteen people who died when the tower at Siloam
\add outside Jerusalem\add* fell on them. Do you think \add that this happened to them
because\add* they were more sinful than all the other people who lived in Jerusalem?
\v 5 I assure you, \add that was\add* not so! But instead, you \add need to realize that
God\add* will similarly punish you \add eternally\add* if you do not turn from your sinful behavior!”
\s Luke 13:6-9 
\s Jesus warned that he would punish the Jews for not showing that they appreciated God's blessings.
\p
\v 6 Then Jesus told them this illustration \add to show how God would treat the Jews, whom he continually blessed, but who did
not do things that please him\add*: “A man planted a fig tree on his farmland. ◄Each
year\add \f + \ft Or: Many \f* times\add*► he came to it looking for figs, but there were no figs.
\v 7 Then he said to the gardener, ‘Look \add here\add*! I have been looking for fruit on this fig tree every year for the past
three years, but there have been no figs. Cut it down! ◄It is just using up the nutrients in the soil for nothing!\f + \ft Or: Why \f* should
it continue using up the \add nutrients in\add* the soil \add for
nothing\add*?► \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f*’ 
\v 8 But the man replied to the owner, ‘Sir, leave it here for another year. I will dig around it and put manure around it.
\v 9 If it bears fruit next year, we\add (inc)\add* will allow it to keep growing. If it does not bear fruit next year,
you\add (sg)\add* can cut it down.’” 
\s Luke 13:10-17 
\s Jesus told a synagogue leader that he was being hypocritical regarding working on the Sabbath.
\p
\v 10 One ◄Sabbath\f + \ft Or: Jewish \f* day of rest►, \add Jesus\add* was teaching people in one of the Jewish meeting places.
\v 11 There was a woman there whom an evil spirit \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* had crippled for eighteen years. She was always bent over; she could
not stand up straight. 
\v 12 When Jesus saw her, he called her over to him. He said to her, “Woman,
\add I am\add* freeing you\add (sg)\add* from your illness!” 
\v 13 He put his hands on her. Immediately she stood up straight, and she praised God!
\v 14 But the man in charge ◄of the synagogue\f + \ft Or: of \f* the meeting place► was angry because Jesus had healed her ◄on the Sabbath\f + \ft Or: on \f*
the Jewish rest day►. \add He considered that healing was doing work\add*. So he said to the people, “There are six days
\add each week\add* in which \add our Jewish\add* laws permit people to work.
\add If you need healing\add*, those are the days to come ◄\add to the synagogue\f + \ft Or: to \f* the meeting
place\add*► and be healed. Do not come on our Jewish day of rest!”
\v 15 Then the Lord replied to him, “You\add (sg) and your fellow religious leaders
are\add* hypocrites! ◄On the Sabbath\f + \ft Or: On \f* the our Jewish day of rest►,
\add just like on every other day\add*, ◄each of you unties his ox or donkey, and then leads it from the food trough to where
it can drink water.\f + \ft Or: does \f* not each of you untie his ox or donkey, and then lead it from the food trough to where it can drink
water?► \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* \add That is work, too!\add* 
\v 16 This woman \add is more important than an animal; she is a
Jew\add*, descended from Abraham! But Satan has \add kept her\add* \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f*
\add crippled\add* for eighteen years, \add as though\add* he had tied her
\add and not let her escape!\add* So ◄it is certainly right that she be freed {that
\add I\add* free her}, \add even if this\add* is a Sabbath day!\f + \ft Or: was \f* it not right that she be freed {that
\add I\add* free her}, \add even if this\add* is a Jewish rest day?► \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f*”
\v 17 After he said that, all the people \add there\add* who opposed him were ashamed. But all the
\add other\add* people \add there\add* were happy about all the wonderful things he was doing.
\s Luke 13:18-21 (Mt. 13:31-33; Mk. 4:30-32) 
\s Jesus gave two illustrations about God's rule over people's lives.
\p
\v 18 Then he said, “◄I will tell you how \add the number of people who
let\add* God rule \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* \add their lives will increase\add*.\f + \ft Or: Do \f* you know how
\add the number of people who let\add* God rule \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* \add their lives will
increase\add*?► \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* I will tell you what I can compare it to. 
\v 19 It is like a \add tiny\add* mustard seed that a man planted in his field. It grew until it became
\add big, like\add* a tree. It was \add so big that\add* birds built nests in its branches.”
\p
\v 20 Then he said, “I will tell \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* you something else, to illustrate how the people who let God rule \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f*
\add their lives can influence their society more and more\add*.
\v 21 It is like \add a little bit of\add* yeast that a woman mixed with about fifty pounds of flour.
\add That small amount of yeast made\add* the whole batch of dough swell up.”
\s Luke 13:22-30 (Mt. 7:13-14, 21-23) 
\s Jesus warns that not all people who think that they will go to heaven will go there.
\p
\v 22  \add Jesus\add* continued traveling, along \add with the disciples\add*, through various towns and villages on the way
to Jerusalem. As they went, he was teaching \add the people\add*.
\v 23 Someone asked him, “Lord, will there be only a few people who are saved {whom
\add God\add* saves}?” He replied to them, “\add There will not be many,
because\add* the way \add to heaven\add* \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* is \add like\add* a narrow door.
\v 24  \add Therefore, try hard\add* to enter that narrow doorway, because I tell you that many people will try to enter
\add heaven by some other way\add*, but they will not be able to get in.
\v 25  \add God is like\add* the owner of a house. \add Some day\add* he will lock the door. Then
\add some of\add* you will begin to stand outside the door and knock. You will say, ‘Lord, open the door for us!’ But he will
reply, ‘\add No, I will not open it, because\add* I do not know you, and I do not know where you are from!’
\v 26 Then you will say, ‘◄\add You must have forgotten that\f + \ft Or: Surely \f* you know us,
because\add*► \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* we\add (exc)\add* ate \add meals\add* with you\add (sg)\add*, and you taught
\add people\add* in the streets of our \add towns!\add*’ 
\v 27 But he will say, ‘\add I tell you again\add*, I do not know you, and I do not know where you are from. You
\add are\add* wicked people! Get away from here!’” 
\v 28 Then Jesus continued by saying, “\add From where God will send
you\add*, you will see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the distance. All the prophets
\add who lived long ago will also be there\add*, in the kingdom where God
\add is ruling\add*. But you will be outside, crying and grinding your teeth
\add because you will have severe pain!\add* 
\v 29 Furthermore, many \add non-Jewish\add* people will \add be
inside\add*. There will be ones who have come from \add lands to\add* the north, east, south, and west. They will be feasting
in ◄that place where God is ruling\f + \ft Or: God \f*'s kingdom►. 
\v 30 Think about this: Some people whom others do not \add consider\add* important
\add now, God will make\add* them very important \add then\add*, and some people whom
\add others consider\add* very important \add now, God will make\add* to be not important
\add then\add*.” 
\s Luke 13:31-35 (Mt. 23:37-39) 
\s Jesus stated that it was necessary for him as a prophet to die in Jerusalem.
\p
\v 31 At that very time, some Pharisees came and said to Jesus, “Leave this area, because
\add the ruler\add* Herod \add Antipas\add* wants to kill you\add (sg)\add*!”
\v 32 He replied to them, “Herod is \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* \add as cruel as\add* a fox,
\add but also as insignificant as a fox\add*. \add So I do not worry about
him\add*. But \add to show him that no one can harm me until it is the time and place God has
determined\add*, go tell him this \add message from me\add*: ‘Listen! I am expelling demons and performing miracles today, and
\add I will continue doing\add* it for a short time. After that, I will finish my work.
\v 33 But I must continue my trip \add to Jerusalem\add* during the coming days, because
\add they killed many other\add* prophets there, and \add since I am also a
prophet\add*, no other place is appropriate for people to kill \add me\add*.’”
\p
\v 34  \add Then Jesus said\add*, “O \add people of\add* \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* Jerusalem \\f + \\ft apostrophe \\f*! You killed the prophets
\add who lived long ago, and you killed others\add*, whom \add God\add* sent to you,
\add by throwing\add* stones \add at them\add*. Many times I wanted to gather you together
\add to protect you\add* \\f + \\ft simile \\f* like a hen gathers her young chicks under her wings. But you did not want
\add me to do that\add*. 
\v 35 So listen to this: Your city \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* \f + \ft (OR, your temple) is going to be abandoned (OR, God will no longer protect it) \f*. I will
\\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* also tell you this: I \add will enter your city only once more. After
that\add*, you will not see me until the time when \add I return
and\add* you say \add about me\add*, ‘God is truly pleased with this man who comes with God's authority \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f*!’”
