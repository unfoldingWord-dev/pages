\v 1 When the Emperor Tiberius had been ruling \add the Roman Empire\add* for fifteen years, and while Pontius Pilate was the
governor of Judea \add district\add*, and Herod \add Antipas\add* was ruling Galilee
\add district\add*, and his brother Philip was ruling Iturea and Trachonitis
\add districts\add*, and Lysanius was ruling Abilene \add district\add*,
\v 2 and while Annas and Caiaphas were the high priests \add in Jerusalem\add*, God gave messages to Zechariah's son John while
he was living in the desolate region. 
\v 3  \add So\add* John went all over the area close to the Jordan
\add River\add*. He kept telling people, “If you want \add God\add* to forgive you for your sins, you must ◄repent/turn away
from your sinful behavior► \add before you ask me\add* to baptize
\add you\add*!” 
\p
\v 4 John was the one who \add fulfilled\add* these words that had
\add been written\add* by the prophet Isaiah {that the prophet Isaiah had written} on a scroll
\add long ago\add*: 
\pi In a desolate area, someone \f + \fr synecdoche \f* will be heard shouting \add to the people who pass
by\add*, 
\pi Prepare yourselves \add to receive\add* the Lord when he comes!
\pi \add Make yourselves ready so that you will be prepared when he
comes\add*, 
\pi \add just like people\add* straighten out the road \f + \fr metaphor \f* \add for an important
official\add* [MET, DOU]! 
\pi
\v 5  \add Just like people\add* level off all the places where the land rises and
\add just like they\add* fill all the ravines, 
\pi and \add just like people\add* make the road straight wherever it is crooked,
\pi and \add just like people\add* make smooth the bumps in the road,
\pi \add Similarly you need to remove all the obstacles which prevent God from blessing
you!\add* 
\pi
\v 6 Then people \f + \fr synecdoche \f* everywhere will understand how God can save \f + \fr metonymy \f*
\add people\add*. 
\p
\v 7 Although large groups of people came to John to be baptized {in order that he would baptize them},
\add he knew that many of them were not sincere\add*. So he kept saying to them, “You
\add people are evil\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f* \add like\add* poisonous snakes!
\add I\add* warn you that \add God\add* will some day punish \f + \fr metonymy \f*
\add everyone\add* who sins. And ◄do not think that you can escape
\add from his punishing\add* \f + \fr metonymy \f* \add you if you do not turn from your sinful behavior!/did someone tell
you\add* that you can escape \add from his punishing\add* \f + \fr metonymy \f* \add you if you do not turn from your sinful
behavior\add*?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* \f + \fr (OR, Who told you that you could escape \add God's
punishment?\add*) 
\v 8 Do the deeds that are appropriate for people who have truly turned from their sinful behavior!
\add God promised to give Abraham many\add* descendants. In order to fulfill that promise, God does not need you! I tell you
that he can change these stones to make them descendants of Abraham! So do not begin to say to yourselves,
‘We\add (exc)\add* are descendants of Abraham, \add so God will not punish us, even though we
have\add* sinned!’ 
\v 9  \add God is ready to punish you if you do not turn away from your sinful behavior, just like a
man\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f* lays his axe at the roots \add of a fruit\add* tree\add to chop it down and throw it into the fire if it does
not produce good fruit\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f*.” 
\p
\v 10  \add Then\add* various ones in the crowd asked him, “What shall
we\add (exc)\add* do \add to escape God punishing us\add* (OR), \add to show that we have
repented\add*?” 
\v 11 He answered them, “If any of you has two shirts, you should give one of them to someone who has no shirt. If any of you
has \add plenty of\add* food, you should give some to those who have no food.”
\v 12  \add Some\add* tax collectors came \add and asked\add* to be baptized
{\add asked him\add* to baptize them}. They asked him, “Teacher, what shall
we\add (exc)\add* do \add to please God\add*?” 
\v 13 He said to them, “Do not take from the people any more money than
\add the Roman government\add* tells you to take!” 
\v 14 Some soldiers asked him, “What about us? What should we\add (exc)\add* do
\add to please God\add*?” He said to them, “Do not \add say to anyone\add*,
‘\add If you(sg) do not give me\add* some money, I will hurt you,’ and do not
take\add people to court and\add* falsely accuse them of doing something wrong! And be content with your wages.”
\p
\v 15 People were expecting \add that the Messiah would come soon\add*. Because of that, many of them wondered about John.
\add Some of them asked him\add* if he was the Messiah. 
\v 16 John replied to them all, “No, \add I am not\add*. I used \add only\add* water when I baptized you. But
\add the Messiah\add* will soon come! He is far greater than I am.
\add He is so great that\add* I am not worthy to \add be like his slave
and\add* untie his sandals \f + \fr metaphor \f* \add like\add* a slave would do! He will put
\add his\add* Holy Spirit within \f + \fr metonymy \f* you \add to truly change your
lives\add*, and \add he will judge others of you and punish you in\add* the fire \f + \fr metaphor \f*
\add in hell\add*. 
\v 17 He \add is like a man\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f* \add who wants to\add* clear away the grain on the ground where it has been threshed
{they have threshed it}. That man \add uses\add* a huge fork \add to throw the grain into the
air\add* to separate the wheat from the chaff \f + \fr metaphor \f*, and then he cleans up the threshing area.
\add Similarly, God\add* will \add separate righteous people from the evil people, like a man
who\add* gathers the wheat into his storage area, and then he will burn
\add those who are like\add* chaff with a fire ◄that will never be put out/that will burn forever►.”
\p
\v 18 John kept telling them many things to urge them \add to turn to
God\add*, as he told them the good message \add from God\add*. 
\v 19 He also rebuked \add the ruler of the district\add*, Herod
\add Antipas. He rebuked him\add* for \add marrying\add* Herodias, his brother's wife,
\add while his brother was still alive\add*, and for doing many other evil things.
\v 20 But Herod \add had his soldiers\add* put John in prison. That was another evil thing he did.
\s Luke 3:21-22 
\s John baptized Jesus. 
\p
\v 21  \add But before John was put in prison\add*, when many people were being baptized {when he was baptizing many people},
after Jesus was baptized and {he baptized Jesus} and Jesus was praying, the sky opened.
\v 22 Then the Holy Spirit, resembling a dove, descended upon \add Jesus\add*. And
\add God\add* [SYN/EUP] spoke to Jesus from heaven, saying, “You\add (sg) \f*\add* are my Son, the one whom I love dearly. I am
very pleased with you!”
