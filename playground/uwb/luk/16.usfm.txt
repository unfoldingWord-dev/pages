\c 16  
\s Luke 16:1-13 
\s Jesus taught that we should handle our money in ways that are pleasing to God.
\p
\v 1  \add Jesus\add* also said to his disciples, "Once there was a rich man who had a household manager.
\add One day\add* he was told \f + \ft Or:\add someone\add* told him \f* that \add the
manager\add* was managing the rich man's money badly. 
\v 2 So he summoned \add the manager\add* and said to him, 'It is terrible what they are saying about
you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add*!\f + \ft Or: Is it true what they are saying about you\add ( singular )\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*? \f* Give me a written account of
\add the funds\add* you have been managing, because you can no longer be my
\add household\add* manager!' 
\v 3 Then the manager said to himself, 'My master is going to dismiss me from my work, so I do not know what to do.\f + \ft Or: what shall
I do ( rhetorical question )? \f* I am not strong enough to \add work by\add* digging ditches, and I am ashamed to beg
\add for money\add*.' 
\v 4  \add Suddenly he had an idea\add*. 'I know what I will do, so that people will take me into their houses
\add and provide for me\add* after I am dismissed \f + \ft Or:after my master dismisses me \f* from my work!'
\v 5 So \add one by one\add* he summoned the people who owed his master money. He asked the first one, 'How much do
you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* owe my master?' 
\v 6 The man replied, 'Eight hundred gallons of olive oil.' The manager said to him, 'Take your bill and sit down and quickly
change it to 400 \add gallons!\add*' 
\v 7 He said to another man, 'How much do you owe?' The man replied, 'A thousand bushels of wheat.' The manager said to him,
'Take your bill and change it to eight hundred \add bushels\add*!'
\add He did similar things for the others who owed his master money\add*.
\v 8 When his master \add heard what the manager had done\add*, he admired the dishonest manager for the clever thing he had
done. \add The truth\add* is that the ungodly people in this world act more wisely toward other people than godly people \f + \ft metaphor \f*
act. 
\v 9  \add So\add* I tell you\add \f + \ft plural \f*\add* this: Use the money that you have
\add here\add* on earth to help others so that they will become your friends. Then when
\add you die and\add* you cannot \add take\add* any money with you,
\add God and his angels\add* will welcome you into a home \add in
heaven\add* that will last forever. 
\p
\v 10 People who faithfully manage small \add matters\add* will also faithfully manage important
\add matters\add*. People who are dishonest in \add the way they
handle\add* small \add matters\add* will be dishonest \add in the way they
handle\add* important \add matters\add*. 
\v 11 So if you have not faithfully handled the money that \add God has given you
here\add* on earth, he will certainly not allow you to possess the true
\add spiritual\add* riches\add in heaven!\add*\f + \ft Or: would he allow you to possess the true
\add spiritual\add* riches\add in heaven\add*? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* 
\v 12 And if you have not faithfully managed things that belong to other people,
\add God\add* will certainly not allow you to receive \add treasures in heaven
that\add* would belong to you!\f + \ft Or: would God allow you to receive \add treasures in heaven
that\add* would belong to you? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* 
\v 13 No servant is able to serve two \add different\add* bosses
\add at the same time. If he tried to do that\add*, he would hate one of them and love the other one, or he would be loyal to
one of them and despise the other one. \add Similarly\add*, you cannot
\add devote your life\add* to worshipping God and \add worshipping\add* money and material goods
\add at the same time\add*." 
\s Luke 16:14-18 
\s Jesus taught that God's laws are permanent. 
\p
\v 14 There were some Pharisees \add there\add*. They loved \add to
acquire\add* money. When they heard Jesus say that, they ridiculed him.
\v 15 But he said to them, "You try to make other people think that you are righteous, but God knows your inner
beings\f + \ft Or: hearts \f*. \add So he will reject you. Keep in mind that many\add* things that people think are important, God thinks are
detestable. 
\p
\v 16 The laws that \add God gave Moses\add* and what the prophets \f + \ft metonymy \f*
\add wrote\add* were \add in effect\f + \ft Or: what you needed to obey\add* \f* until John
\add the Baptizer\add* came. Since then \add I\add* have been preaching about how God wants to
\add rule people's lives in a new way\add*, and many people are \add accepting that message
and\add* very eagerly asking God to control \add their lives. But that does not mean that God has abolished the laws that he
established previously\add*. 
\v 17  \add All of God's\add* laws, \add even those that seem\add* insignificant, are more permanent than heaven and earth.
\p
\v 18  \add For example, because God considers that a marriage lasts until either the husband or the wife dies, he considers
that\add* any man who divorces his wife and marries another woman is committing adultery. He also
\add considers that\add* any man who marries a woman who has been divorced by her husband \f + \ft Or:whose husband has divorced her \f* is
\add also\add* committing adultery." 
\s Luke 16:19-31 
\s Jesus warned what would happen to those who did not share their possessions with poor people.
\p
\v 19  \add Jesus also said\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, "Once there was a rich man who wore
\add expensive\add* purple and linen \add garments\add*. He ate luxuriously every day.
\v 20 And every day a poor man whose name was Lazarus was laid \f + \ft Or:\add some people
also\add* laid a poor man whose name was Lazarus \f* at the gate of the rich man's
\add house\add*. Lazarus' body was covered with sores. 
\v 21 He \add was so hungry that he\add* wanted to eat the scraps
\add of food\add* that fell from the table where the rich man \add ate\add*. Furthermore,
\add to make things worse\add*, dogs came and licked his sores. 
\v 22  \add Eventually\add* the poor man died. Then he was taken by the angels \f + \ft Or:the angels took him \f* to
\add start feasting\add* next to his \add great ancestor\add* Abraham. The rich man also died, and his body was buried
\f + \ft Or:\add some people\add* buried his body \f*. 
\v 23 In the place where dead people wait \add for God to judge them\add*, he was suffering great pain. He looked up and saw
Abraham far away, and he saw Lazarus sitting close to Abraham. 
\v 24 So he shouted, 'Father Abraham, I am suffering very much in this fire! So
\add please\add* pity me, and send Lazarus \add here\add* so that he can dip his finger in water
\add and touch\add* my tongue to cool it!' 
\v 25 But Abraham replied, 'Son, remember that while you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* were alive
\add on earth\add* you enjoyed \add many\add* good things. But Lazarus was miserable. Now
\add it is fair that\add* he is happy here, and you are suffering.
\v 26 Besides that, there is a huge ravine between you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* and us. So those who want to go from here to where
you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* are, are not able to. Furthermore, no one can cross from there to where
we\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* are.' 
\v 27 Then the rich man said, 'If that is so, father \add Abraham\add*, I ask
you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* to send \add Lazarus\add* to my father's house.
\v 28 I have five brothers \add who live there\add*. Tell him to warn them
\add to turn away from their sinful behavior so that\add* they do not also come to this place, where
\add we\f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* suffer great pain!' 
\v 29 But Abraham replied, '\add No, I will not do that, because your
brothers\add* are able to \add go to the Jewish meeting places where the
priests\add* read what Moses and the prophets \add wrote\add*. They should listen to what Moses and the prophets \f + \ft metonymy \f*
\add wrote\add*!' 
\v 30 But the rich man replied, 'No, father Abraham, \add that will not be
enough\add*! But if someone from those who have died goes back to them
\add and warns them\add*, they will turn from their sinful behavior.'
\v 31  \add Abraham\add* said to him, 'No! If they do not listen to
\add what\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* Moses and the prophets \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add wrote\add*, even if someone would rise from among the dead
\add and go and warn them\add*, they would not be convinced \f + \ft Or:he could not convince them \f*
\add that they should turn from their sinful behavior\add*.'Â "
