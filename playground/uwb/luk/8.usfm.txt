\s Luke 8:1-3 
\s The list of women who helped Jesus. 
\p
\v 1 Soon after that, Jesus went, along with his twelve \add disciples\add*, through various cities and villages. As they went,
he was telling people the good message about how God wants ◄to have complete control/to rule► \f + \fr metaphor \f*
\add over their lives\add*. 
\v 2 Some women from whom he had expelled evil spirits and healed of diseases also
\add went with him\add*. These included Mary, the woman from Magdala
\add village\add*, from whom \add he had expelled\add* seven evil spirits;
\v 3 Joanna, the wife of Chuza, who was one of \add King\add* Herod
\add Antipas'\add* officials; Susanna; and many others. They were providing some of their own funds
\add to help Jesus and his disciples\add*. 
\s Luke 8:4-8 
\s The story about four different kinds of soil. 
\p
\v 4 A great crowd of people came to Jesus from many towns. Then he told them this parable:
\v 5 “A man went out \add to his field\add* to sow \add some\add* seeds. As he was scattering them over the soil, some
\add of the seeds\add* fell on the path. Then \add people\add* walked on those seeds, and birds ate them.
\v 6 Some \add of the seeds\add* fell on rock \add on which there was a thin layer
of\add* moist \add soil\add*. As soon as the seeds grew, the plants dried up because they had no moisture.
\v 7 Some \add of the seeds\add* fell on \add ground that contained roots
of\add* thorny \add weeds\add*. The thorny weeds grew \add together\add* with the young plants, and
\add they\add* crowded out \add the plants\add*. 
\v 8 But some of the seeds fell on good soil and grew \add well\add*.
\add Each seed later\add* produced a hundred \add grains\add*.” Then Jesus shouted to them, “If you want to understand \f + \fr metonymy \f*
this, you must consider \add carefully what I have just said\add*!”
\s Luke 8:9-15 
\s Jesus explained that the story represented different ways people respond to his teaching.
\p
\v 9 Jesus' disciples \add later\add* asked him about the meaning of the parable
\add he had just told\add*. 
\v 10 He said, “God is revealing to you what he did not reveal before, about
\add how he wants to\add* rule \f + \fr metaphor \f* \add over people's lives\add*. But when I am telling other people about
\add these things, I tell them\add* only in parables. The result will be
\add like a prophet predicted long ago:\add* 
\q They will see \add what I am doing\add*, but will not perceive
\add what it means\add*. They will hear \add what I am saying\add*, but will not understand
\add it\add*. 
\p
\v 11 So this is the meaning of that parable: The seeds \add represent\add* God's message.
\v 12  \add Some people are like\add* the path on which some of \add the seeds
fell\add*. When these people hear God's message, the devil comes and causes them to forget what they have heard. As a result,
they do not believe it and will not be saved {\add God\add* will not save them}.
\v 13  \add Some people are like\add* the \add soil with\add* rock
\add underneath\add*. When they hear \add God's\add* message, they accept it joyfully.
\add But because it does not penetrate deeply\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f* \add into their inner
beings\add*, they believe it for \add only\add* a \add short\add* time.
\add They are like the plants that\add* did not have \add deep\add* roots. When difficult things happen to them, they stop
believing \add God's message\add*. 
\v 14  \add Some people are like\add* the \add soil that had roots
of\add* thorny \add weeds\add* in it. They are people who accept
\add God's message\add*, but later on they worry about things, and try to become rich, and enjoy
\add things that give them\add* a lot of pleasure. So they do not become
\add spiritually\add* mature. 
\v 15 But \add some people are like\add* the good soil. They hear
\add God's\add* message and accept it. They \add become\add* good, honest people, and they continue doing things
\add that please God\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f*.” 
\s Luke 8:16-18 
\s Jesus explained the need to make his truth clear to others. 
\p
\v 16 “After people light a lamp, they do not cover it with a basket or put it under a bed. Instead, they put it on a
lampstand, so that those who enter \add the house\add* can see \add things
from\add* its light \f + \fr metaphor \f*. \add Similarly, you must tell God's truth to others so that they can know what I can do for
them\add*. 
\v 17  \add God wants to\add* make clear all \add of his truth\add* that was not evident previously.
\add He intends\add* that all of\add the truth\add* that \add he\add* had not revealed before be told openly {that
\add his people\add* openly tell \add others\add* all \add of the
truth\add* that \add he\add* has not revealed before}. 
\v 18 So listen carefully \add to what I tell you\add*, because \add God\add* will enable those who accept
\add my truth\add* to \add understand even\add* more. But \add God\add* will cause those who do not accept
\add my truth\add* to not understand even \add the little\add* that they think they have
\add understood\add*.” 
\s Luke 8:19-21 
\s Jesus told them that some people are as dear to him as his own relatives.
\p
\v 19  \add One day Jesus'\add* mother and his \add younger\add* brothers came to see him, but they could not get near him
because there was a large crowd \add around him in the house\add*.
\v 20 Someone told him, “Your mother and your \add younger\add* brothers are standing outside, wanting to see you.”
\v 21 He replied, “Those who hear God's message and obey it are \add as dear to
me\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f* as my mother and my brothers.” 
\s Luke 8:22-25 
\s Jesus calmed a storm. 
\p
\v 22 One day Jesus got into a boat with his disciples. He said to them, “Let's go
\add around to\add* the other side of the lake.” So they started to go.
\v 23 As they were sailing, he fell asleep. A big windstorm came down on the lake. Soon the boat was filling with water, and
they were in danger. 
\v 24 They woke him up. They said \add to him\add*, “Master! Master!
We\add (inc)\add* are going to drown!” He got up and rebuked the wind and told the waves to be calm. The wind stopped blowing
and the waves calmed down. \add The lake\add* became calm. 
\v 25 He said to them, “◄I \add am disappointed that\add* you did not trust me
\add to help you\add*!/Why did you not trust me \add to help you\add*?►” \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* They were afraid. They were also amazed. They
said to each other, “◄What kind of man is this?/This man is not like ordinary men!► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* He
\add not only commands people, but\add* when he commands the wind and the water, they also obey him!”
\s Luke 8:26-39 
\s Jesus expelled many demons from a man. 
\p
\v 26 Jesus and his disciples arrived at the region near Gerasa, a
\add town\add* which \add was on the eastern\add* side of Lake \add Galilee\add*.
\v 27  \add There was\add* a man \add in that region\add* in whom demons lived.
\add He was\add* from the town \add of Gerasa\add*. \f + \fr (OR, \add In that area there
was\add* a man \add from that town\add* whom demons controlled.) For a long time he had not worn clothes. He did not live in a
house. Instead, he lived in burial caves. 
\v 28-29 Many times \add demons\add* attacked him. He was guarded
{\add People\add* tried to guard him} \add so that he would not injure
others\add*. Chains were fastened {They fastened chains} on his hands and shackles on his feet, but he would break the chains
and shackles. Then he would be sent away by the demons {the demons would send him away} to the desolate area.
\p When Jesus stepped out of the boat onto the shore, the man saw him. He
\add ran to Jesus\add* and prostrated himself before him. Then Jesus commanded, “You evil spirit, come out of that man!” But it
\add did not leave immediately. Instead, it\add* caused the man to shout very loudly, “Jesus, Son of the great God in heaven,
since we\add (inc)\add* have nothing in common, \add leave me alone\add* \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*! I beg you, do not torture me
\add now\add*!” 
\v 30  \add In order to expel the demon more easily\add*, Jesus asked
\add the demon\add*, “What is your\add (sg)\add* name?” He replied, “My name is Crowd/Mob.”
\add He said that\add* because many demons had entered that man.
\v 31  \add The demons\add* kept begging \add Jesus\add* that he would not command them to go into the deep place
\add where God punishes demons\add*. 
\v 32 There was a large herd of pigs ◄grazing/rooting for food► on the hillside. The demons begged Jesus that he allow them to
enter the pigs. So he did. 
\v 33 The demons left the man and entered the pigs. Then the herd
\add of pigs\add* rushed down the steep bank into the lake and drowned.
\p
\v 34 When the men who were taking care of the pigs saw what happened, they ran! They told people inside the town and outside
the town what had happened. 
\v 35 So people went out to see what had happened. When they came to where Jesus was, they saw that the man from whom Jesus had
\add expelled\add* the demons was sitting at the feet of Jesus, \add listening to
him\add*. He had clothes on, and his mind was normal again. Then those people became afraid
\add because they thought that he would destroy more of their property\add* (OR,
\add because they realized that he must be very powerful\add*). 
\v 36 The people who had seen what happened told those \add who had just
arrived\add* how \add Jesus\add* had healed the man whom demons were controlling
\add before\add*. 
\v 37 Then \add those people and\add* many other people \f + \fr hyperbole \f* from the area near Gerasa asked Jesus to leave their area. They
were very afraid of \add what else Jesus would do to them\add*. So
\add Jesus and the disciples\add* got into the boat to go back across the lake.
\v 38 The man from whom he had \add expelled\add* the demons begged him saying,
“\add Please\add*, let me go with you!” But \add Jesus refused. Instead\add*, he said to him,
\v 39 “\add No\add*, go home and tell people how much God has done for you!” Then he sent him away. So he went away and told
people throughout the town how much Jesus had done for him. 
\s Luke 8:40-56 
\s Jesus caused a young girl to become alive again and healed a woman who had been bleeding for years.
\p
\v 40 When \add Jesus and the disciples\add* returned \add to Capernaum\add*, a crowd of people who had been waiting for him
welcomed him. 
\v 41 Just then a man named Jairus, who was one of the leaders ◄of the synagogue/of the Jewish meeting place►
\add there\add*, came near and prostrated himself at Jesus' feet. He pleaded with Jesus, “Please come to my house
\add and heal my daughter\add*, 
\v 42 because my only daughter, who is about twelve years old, is dying!”
\p As Jesus went with him, many people crowded close to Jesus. 
\v 43 Then a woman came near. She had been suffering from constant
\add vaginal\add* \f + \fr euphemism \f* bleeding for twelve years, but she could not be healed by anyone {no one could heal her}.
\v 44 She came behind \add Jesus\add* and touched the edge of his robe
\add in order to be healed\add*. At once her bleeding stopped. 
\v 45 Jesus said, “Who touched me?” When everyone said that they had not touched him, Peter said, “Lord, there is a great crowd
of people around you\add (sg)\add* and crowding against you, \add so any one of them might have touched
you\add*!” 
\v 46 But Jesus said, “\add I know that\add* someone \add deliberately\add* touched me,
\add because\add* my power has healed someone \add who touched me\add*.”
\v 47 When the woman realized that she could not prevent \add Jesus\add* (OR,
\add people\add*) from knowing that \add she was healed\add*, her body began to shake.
\add She was afraid that because she had disobeyed the law that a woman with such a condition should not touch others, Jesus
might scold her for doing that\add*. She prostrated herself before him. As the other people were listening, she told why she
had touched him and how she had been healed immediately. 
\v 48  \add Jesus\add* said to her, “◄Ma'am/My dear woman►, because you believed \f + \fr personification \f*
\add that I could heal you, I\add* have healed you. Go \add from here, and may you experience
God's\add* peace \add within you\add*.” 
\p
\v 49 While he was still talking \add to her\add*, a man from Jairus' house came and said to him, “Your daughter has died. So
◄it is useless that you bother the teacher any longer \add by urging him to go to your
house\add*!/why do you bother the teacher any longer \add by urging him to go to your
house\add*?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*” 
\v 50 But when Jesus heard that, he said to Jairus, “Do not think that there is nothing more that can be done. Just believe
that \add I can help her. If you(sg) \f* do that\add*, she will live again.”
\v 51 When they arrived outside the house, he allowed only Peter, John, James, and the girl's mother and father to go in the
house with him. 
\v 52 All the people \add there\add* were crying and beating their breasts
\add to show that they were sad\add*. But, \add knowing that he would cause the girl to live
again\add*, he said to them, “Stop crying! She is not dead! She is
\add just\add* sleeping \f + \fr metaphor \f*!” 
\v 53 The people laughed at him, because they knew that \add the
girl\add* was dead. 
\v 54 But \add Jesus\add* took hold of her hand and called to her, saying, “Child, get up!”
\v 55 At once her spirit returned \add to her body\add* and she got up. Jesus told
\add them\add* to give her something to eat. 
\v 56 Her parents were amazed, but Jesus told them not to tell anyone
\add else yet\add* what had happened.
