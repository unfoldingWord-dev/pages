\c 7  
\s Luke 7:1-10 
\s Jesus healed a man without going to his house because the man's master believed that Jesus could do that.
\p
\v 1 After Jesus finished saying this to the people, he went \add with his
disciples\add* to Capernaum \add town\add*. 
\v 2 There was a Roman army officer there who had a slave whom he greatly esteemed. This slave was so sick that he was about to
die. 
\v 3 When the officer heard about Jesus, he \add summoned\add* some Jewish elders. He told them to go to Jesus and ask him to
come and heal his slave. 
\v 4 When they came to where Jesus was, they earnestly asked Jesus
\add to return with them\add*. They said, “This officer deserves that
you\add (sg)\add* do this \add for him\add*, 
\v 5 because he loves us \add Jewish\add* people, and he \add paid the money
to\add* build a synagogue for us.” 
\v 6 So Jesus went with them. When he was near the \add officer's\add* house, the officer
\add decided that it was not necessary for Jesus to come to his house. So
he\add* summoned some friends. He \add told them to\add* go to Jesus and tell him this: “Lord\f + \ft Or: Sir \f*, do not bother to come.
\add Because I am a non-Jew\add*, I am not worthy for you\add (sg)\add*,
\add a Jew\add*, to come into my house \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* \add and associate with
me\add*. 
\v 7 I did not feel worthy to come to you, \add either\add*. But
\add please\add* command \add that\add* my servant\add be healed\add*, and he will become well!
\v 8  \add I believe this\add* because, as for me, there are people who have authority over me
\add and I obey them\add*. I also have soldiers under my \add authority\add*. When I say to one of them, ‘Go!’ he goes. When I
say to another ‘Come!’ he comes. When I say to my slave, ‘Do this!’ he does it.
\add And I believe that you speak with a similar kind of authority\add*.”
\v 9 When \add the officer's friends arrived and\add* told that to Jesus, he marveled at what
\add the officer had said\add*. Then he turned and said to the crowd that was going with him, “I tell you, I have never before
found anyone who trusted \add in me like this non-Jewish man does\add*. No one from Israel,
\add where I would expect people to believe in me\add*, has trusted in me like he has!”
\v 10 When those men returned to the officer's house, they found that the slave was well.
\s Luke 7:11-17 
\s Jesus caused a widow's son to become alive again. 
\p
\v 11 Soon after that, Jesus went to a town called Nain. His disciples and a large crowd
\add of other people\add* went with him. 
\v 12 As they approached the town gate, the corpse of a young man who had just died was being carried out
\add on a stretcher\add* {\add people\add* were carrying out \add on a
stretcher\add* the corpse of a young man who had just died}. His mother was a widow, and he was her only son. A large group of
people from the town were accompanying them. 
\v 13 When the Lord saw her, he pitied her. He said to her, “Do not cry!”
\v 14 Then, \add ignoring the Jewish laws about not coming near a
corpse\add*, he came close and touched the stretcher \add on which the body was
lying\add*. So the men carrying it stood still. He said, “Young man, I say to you, get up!”
\v 15 The man sat up and began to talk! Jesus returned him to his mother
\add to care for her\add*. 
\v 16 Then everyone \add there\add* was amazed\f + \ft Or: awestruck \f*. They praised God, saying, “A great prophet has come among us!” They
also said, “God has come to help his people!” 
\v 17  \add Then they\add* reported what Jesus \add had done\add* throughout all of Judea
\add district\add* and other nearby areas. 
\s Luke 7:18-35 
\s Jesus taught about his ministry and the ministry of John the Baptizer.
\p
\v 18 The disciples of John \add the Baptizer went to the prison where John was
and\add* told him about those things. 
\v 19 So \add one day\add* John summoned two \add of his disciples\add* and
\add told them\add* to go to the Lord and ask him: “Are you \add the Messiah who the prophets prophesied would
come\add*, or is it someone else that we should expect \add to come\add*?”
\v 20 When those two men came to Jesus, they said, “John the Baptizer sent us to ask
you\add (sg)\add* this: Are you \add the Messiah that\add* we are expecting
\add God\add* to send, or shall we\add (exc)\add* expect someone else?”
\v 21 At that very time Jesus was healing many people of their diseases and
\add other\add* sicknesses, he was \add casting out\add* evil spirits, and he was causing many blind people to be able to see.
\v 22 So he answered those two men, “Go back and report to John what you have seen
\add me doing\add* and what you have heard \add me telling people. I am
enabling\add* blind people to see. \add I am enabling\add* lame people to walk.
\add I am\add* healing people who have leprosy. \add I am enabling\add* deaf people to hear.
\add I am causing\add* dead people to become alive again, \add and I
am\add* telling \add God's\add* good message to poor people. 
\v 23  \add Also tell John that God\add* is pleased with those who do not stop believing in me
\add because what I do is not what they expect the Messiah to do\add*.”
\p
\v 24 When the men whom John had sent left, Jesus began to talk to the crowd of people about John. He said to them,
“\add Think about\add* what sort of person you went to see in the desolate area
\add when you went there to see John\add* \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f*. \add You did not go there to listen to a man who constantly changed the nature
of his message\add* \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f*, \add like\add* a reed that is blown back and forth by the wind \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f*.
\v 25 Then what kind of man did you go there to see \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f*? Was he \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* a man who wore expensive clothes? No!
\add You know very well that\add* people who wear beautiful clothes and live in luxury are in kings' palaces,
\add not in the desolate areas\add*! 
\v 26 Then what \add kind of person\add* did you go to see? \add Did
you\add* \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* \add go there to see John because he was\add* a prophet? Yes! But I will tell you that
\add John is\add* more \add important\add* than an \add ordinary\add* prophet.
\v 27 He is the one about whom \add these words\add* that God said to the Messiah have been written
{\add the prophet Malachi\add* wrote \add these words\add*} \add in the
Scriptures\add*: ‘Listen! I am going to send my messenger ahead of
you\add (sg)\add* \\f + \\ft synecdoche \\f*. He will prepare \add people\add* for your coming.’
\p
\v 28 I tell you that from among all the people who have ever lived,
\add God considers that\add* no one is greater than John. However,
\add God considers\add* everyone who has let God rule their \add lives\add* \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* to be greater than
\add John\add*, \add even if they are\add* insignificant \add people\add*.”
\p
\v 29 When they heard \add what Jesus said\add* \f + \ft (OR, \add what John
preached\add*), all the people, including tax collectors, \add whom many people
despised\add*, agreed that God's way was right. By being baptized by John {By
\add letting\add* John baptize them}, \add they had agreed that what God required people to do in order to be saved was
right\add*. 
\v 30 But the Pharisees and the men who taught the \add Jewish\add* laws were not baptized by John {did not
\add let\add* John baptize them} because they rejected what God wanted them to do.
\p
\v 31  \add Then Jesus also said\add*, “◄\add Many of\add* you people have heard what
\add John and I\add* have taught. I will illustrate what you are like.\f + \ft Or: Do \f* you know what
\add many of\add* you people who have heard what \add John and I\add* have taught are like?► \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f*
\v 32 You are like children who are \add playing games\add* in an open area.
\add Some of them\add* are calling to \add the others\add*, saying,
“We\add (exc)\add* played happy music for you on the flute, but you did not dance! Then we sang sad funeral songs for you, but
you did not cry!” 
\v 33  \add Similarly, you people are dissatisfied with both John the Baptizer and
me!\add* When John came and \add preached to you\add*, he did not eat
\add ordinary\add* food \\f + \\ft synecdoche \\f* or drink wine, \add like most people
do\add*. But you \add rejected him\add*, saying, ‘A demon is controlling him!’
\v 34 In\add contrast\add*, \add I\add*, the one who came from heaven, eat
\add the same food\add* and drink \add wine as others do\add*. But you
\add reject me\add*, saying, ‘Look! \add This man\add* eats too much food and drinks too much wine, and he associates with tax
collectors and \add other\add* sinners!’ 
\v 35 But those who are \add truly God's\add* children \\f + \\ft personification \\f* realize that
\add what John and I do is truly\add* wise.” 
\s Luke 7:36-50 
\s Jesus told why he appreciated the sinful woman pouring perfume on his feet.
\p
\v 36  \add One day\add* one of the Pharisees \add named Simon\add* invited Jesus to eat a meal with him. So Jesus went to the
man's house and reclined \add to eat\add*. 
\v 37 There was a woman in that city \add who many people knew had
been\add* a prostitute \\f + \\ft euphemism \\f*. She heard that Jesus was eating in the Pharisee's house. So she went there, taking a stone jar
that contained perfume. 
\v 38  \add As they were reclining to eat\add*, the woman stood behind
\add Jesus, at his\add* feet. As she was crying \add because she was sorry for her sins, her tears fell on Jesus'
feet\add*. Then she wiped his feet with her hair, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the perfume.
\v 39 When the Pharisee who had invited \add Jesus\add* saw that, he thought within himself,
“\add Prophets know about other people's lives\add*, \add so\add* if Jesus were a prophet, he would have known who this woman
is who is touching him, and what kind of a person she is. He would have known that she is a prostitute! \\f + \\ft euphemism \\f*”
\v 40 Jesus said to him, “Simon, there is something I want to tell
you\add (sg)\add*.” He replied, “Teacher, what is it?” 
\v 41 Jesus replied, “Two people owed some money to a man who \add earned money
by\add* lending \add it to others\add*. One owed him five hundred silver coins, and the other owed him fifty silver coins.
\v 42 Neither of them was able to pay back \add what he owed\add*, so the man
\add very kindly\add* said that they did not have to pay back anything. So, which of those two men will love that man more?”
\v 43 Simon replied, “I think that the one who owed the most money and did not have to pay it back
\add will love him more\add*.” Jesus said to him, “That is correct.”
\v 44 Then he turned toward the woman, and said to Simon, “◄Think about
\add what\add* this woman \add has done\add*!\f + \ft Or: Do \f* you\add (sg) \f*\add* see
\add what\add* this woman \add has done\add*?► \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* When I entered your house, you
\add did not follow our custom of welcoming guests by\add* giving me any water
\add to wash\add* my feet, but this woman has wet my feet with her tears and then wiped them with her hair!
\v 45 You did not \add follow our custom of greeting by\add* kissing me, but since I came in she has not stopped kissing my
feet! 
\v 46 You did not \add follow our custom of welcoming guests by\add* anointing my head with
\add olive\add* oil, but she has anointed my feet with fragrant perfume.
\v 47 So I will tell you that even though she has sinned very much, she has been forgiven
{\add I\add* have forgiven her}. \add By what she has done she has shown
that\add* she loves \add me\add* very much. But a person who has
\add sinned\add* just a little bit, but whom \add I\add* have forgiven, will love
\add me just a little bit\add*.” 
\v 48 Then he said to the woman, “You have been forgiven {\add I
have\add* forgiven \add you\add*} \add for\add* your sins.” 
\v 49 Then those who were eating with him said among themselves, “◄This man must
\add think that he is God!\f + \ft Or:  \f*\add*Who does this man \add think that
he\add* is \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f*►, saying that he can forgive \add people for\add* their sins?”
\v 50 But Jesus said to the woman, “Because you have trusted \\f + \\ft personification \\f*
\add in me, God\add* has saved you \add from the guilt of your sins\add*. May
\add God\add* give you inner peace as you go!”
