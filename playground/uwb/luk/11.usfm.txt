\s Luke 11:1-13 
\s Jesus taught his disciples various things about prayer. 
\p
\v 1 One day Jesus was somewhere praying. When he finished \add praying\add*, one of his disciples said to him, "Lord, teach us
\add what to say when\add* we\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* pray, as John \add the
Baptizer\add* taught his disciples!" 
\v 2 He said to them, "When you pray, say \add things like this\add*: 'Father, we want
you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* to be honored\f + \ft Or: revered \f*. \add We want people to let
you\f + \ft singular \f*\add* \f + \ft metonymy, metaphor \f* rule over their lives. 
\v 3 Give us\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* each day the food \f + \ft synecdoche \f* that we need.
\v 4 Forgive us \add for\add* the wrong things that we have done, because we forgive people for the wrong things that they do
to us. Do not let us do wrong things when we are tempted {\add someone or
something\add* tempts us}.'" 
\p
\v 5 Then he said to them, "Suppose that one of you goes to the house of a friend at midnight. Suppose that
you\add \f + \ft singular \f* stand outside and\add* call out to him, 'My friend, please lend me three buns!
\v 6 Another friend of mine who is traveling has just arrived \add at my
house\add*, but I have no food \add ready\add* to give to him!' 
\v 7 Suppose that he answers you from inside \add the house\add*, 'Do not bother me! The door has been locked
{\add We\f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* have locked the door} and all my family are in bed.
\add So\add* I cannot get up and give you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* anything!'
\v 8 I will tell you that even if he does not \add want to\add* get up and give you
\add any food\add*, to avoid being ashamed \add for not helping you\add* because you are his friend \f + \ft Or: if without being
ashamed you continue asking him to do that \f*, he certainly will get up and give you whatever you need.
\v 9 So I tell you this: Keep asking \add God for what you need\add*. If you do that,
\add he\add* will give it to you\add \f + \ft plural \f*\add*. Confidently keep expecting
\add God to give you the things that you need\add*, and \add he\add* will give them to you \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\add It will be like\add* looking for what you need and finding it. Keep on
\add praying urgently to God. Then God will answer you. It will be
like\add* knocking \add on a door\add*. And \add God\add* will open
\add the way\add* for you \add to get what you pray for\add*. 
\v 10 Remember that \add God\add* will give things to everyone who continues to ask
\add him for them\add*. \add He\add* will give things to whoever confidently keeps
asking\add . He\add* will open \add the way\add* for people \add to get the things that they keep urgently praying
for\add*. 
\v 11 If one of you had a son who asked you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* for a fish
\add to eat\add*, you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* certainly would not give him a
\add poisonous\add* snake instead!\f + \ft Or: would you give him a \add poisonous\add* snake instead? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 12 If he asked you for an egg, you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* certainly would not give him a scorpion!\f + \ft Or: would you give him a scorpion? \f*
\f + \ft rhetorical question \f* 
\v 13 Even though you people are evil, you know how to give good things to your children. So your Father in heaven will
certainly \add give good things\add* to those who ask him, \add including\add* giving the Holy Spirit,
\add who is the best gift\add*." 
\s Luke 11:14-28 
\s Jesus taught people various things about demons. 
\p
\v 14  \add One day there was a man there who, because a demon controlled
him\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*, was unable to speak. After \add Jesus expelled\add* the demon, the man
\add began to\add* talk. \add Most of\add* the people \add there\add* were amazed.
\v 15 But some of them said, "It is Beelzebub, the ruler of the demons, who enables
\add this man\add* to expel demons!" 
\v 16 Other \add people there\add* asked him to perform a miracle
\add to prove he was the Messiah\f + \ft Or: that he had come\add* from God \f* [MTY, Or: EUP]. They wanted to trap him
\add into not being able to perform a miracle or into doing something
ridiculous\add*. 
\v 17 But he knew what they were thinking. So he said to them, "If
\add the people in\add* one nation fight against each other, their nation will be destroyed
{\add they\add* will destroy their nation}. If \add the people in\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* one house are divided, they will cease to remain
as one \add family\add*. 
\v 18  \add Similarly\add*, if Satan \add and his demons\add* were fighting against each other, his rule over them would
\add certainly\add* not last!\f + \ft Or: how would his rule over them last? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\add I say this\add* because you are saying that I am expelling demons by
\add the power of\add* the ruler of \add his own demons\add*! 
\v 19 Furthermore, if \add it is true that\add* Satan enables me to expel demons,
\add is it also true that\add* your disciples \add who\add* expel demons
\add do so\add* by \add Satan's\add* power \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*? \add No, that is not
true\add*. So they will show that you \add are not thinking logically\add*.
\v 20 But because it is by the power \f + \ft metonymy \f* of God \add that I expel
demons\add*, I am showing you \add that the power of\add* God to \f + \ft metaphor \f* rule
\add people's lives\add* has come to you." 
\p
\v 21 Then, \add to show that by expelling evil spirits he was making it clear that he was much more powerful than Satan, Jesus
said\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, "When a strong man who has many weapons guards his own house, no one can steal the things in his house.
\v 22 But when someone else who is stronger attacks that man and subdues him, he is able to take away the weapons in which the
man trusted. Then he can take from that man's house anything he \add wants
to\add*. 
\v 23  \add No one can be neutral\add*. Those who do not help me\add are
opposing\add* me, and those who do not gather \add people to become\add*
my\add disciples\add* are causing \add those people\add* to go away
\add from me\add*." 
\p
\v 24  \add Then Jesus said this\add*: "\add Sometimes when\add* an evil spirit leaves someone, it wanders around in desolate
areas seeking \add someone in whom it can\add* rest. If it does not find anyone, it says
\add to itself\add*, 'I will return to the person in whom I used to live!'
\v 25 So it goes back and finds that \add the Spirit of God is not in control of that person's life. The person's life is
like\add* a house that has been {that someone has} swept clean and everything put {put everything} in order,
\add but a house that is empty\add*. 
\v 26 Then \add this evil spirit\add* goes and gets seven other spirits that are
\add even\add* more evil than it is. They \add all\add* enter \add that
person\add* and \add begin\add* living there. \add So\add*, \add although\add* that person's condition
\add was bad\add* before, it became much worse." 
\p
\v 27 When Jesus said that, a woman who was listening called out
\add to him\add*, "\add God is\add* pleased with the woman who gave birth to
you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* and let you nurse \add at her breasts\add*!" 
\v 28 But he replied, "God \add is\add* much more pleased with those who hear his message and obey it!"
\s Luke 11:29-36 
\s Jesus rebuked the people for wanting more miracles. 
\p
\v 29 When the group of people around \add Jesus\add* got larger, he said,
"\add Many of\add* you people who have been observing my ministry are evil. You want
\add me to perform\add* a miracle \add to prove that I have come from
God\add*, but the only miracle that \add I\add* will perform for you is one
\add like happened to\add* Jonah. 
\v 30  \add After Jonah was inside a huge fish for three days, God
performed\add* a miracle \add to bring\add* Jonah \add back to life again. Jonah went and testified about
that\add* to the people in Nineveh \add city. God will perform\add* a similar miracle
\add for me\add*, the one who came from heaven\add . When you people have seen that miracle, you will believe my
message\add*. 
\v 31  \add The\add* queen from \add Sheba\add*, \add far\add* south
\add of Israel, who lived long ago\add*, traveled a long distance to hear Solomon speak
\add many\add* wise things. But now \add I, a man\add* who \add is
much\add* greater \add and wiser\add* than Solomon, am here, \add but you have not listened to what I have told
you\add*. Therefore, at the time when \add God\add* judges \add all
people\add*, the queen from \add Sheba\add* will stand there, \add along\add* with you people, and will condemn you.
\v 32 The people who lived in Nineveh \add city\add* turned from their sinful ways when Jonah preached to them. But now I, who
am greater than Jonah, have come \add and preached to you\add*, \add but you have not turned from your sinful
ways\add*. Therefore, at the time when God judges \add all people\add*, the people who lived in Nineveh will stand there with
you and condemn you." 
\p
\v 33  \add Then, to show them that they did not need more miracles, but that they needed only to understand better what he had
already told them, he said to them\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, "People who light a lamp do not then hide it, or put it under a basket. Instead,
they put it on a lampstand so that those who enter \add the house\add* can see
\add things from\add* its light. \add Similarly, I have not concealed God's truth. I have revealed it to
you\add*. 
\v 34 Your eyes \f + \ft metaphor \f* are like a lamp for your body, because they enable you to see things. If your eyes are healthy, you are
able to see everything well \f + \ft metaphor \f*. \add Similarly, if you\f + \ft singular \f* accept my teaching, you will be able to know all that God wants
you to know\add*. But if your eyes are bad, you are not able to see anything. It is like being in darkness \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\add And similarly, if you\f + \ft plural \f* do not accept what I teach, you will not be able to know all the things that God wants you to
know\add*. 
\v 35 Therefore, \add you\f + \ft plural \f* do not need to see more miracles. You need to think carefully about what I have
already\add* told you, so that the things that you have heard from others do not cause you to remain in spiritual darkness
\f + \ft metaphor \f*. 
\v 36 If you \add live completely according to God's truth, you will be able to know everything that God wants you to know. It
will be like\add* being in a room with a lamp shining brightly, enabling you to see everything clearly."
\s Luke 11:37-54 (Mt. 23:1-36; Mk. 12:38-40) 
\s Jesus rebuked the Jewish leaders for only pretending to be good.
\p
\v 37 While Jesus finished saying those things, a Pharisee invited him to eat a meal with him. So Jesus went to
\add his house\add* and ate with him. 
\v 38 The Pharisee was surprised when he saw that Jesus did not follow the Pharisees' ritual by washing his hands before
eating. \add The Pharisees washed their hands in a certain way to be cleansed from anything that might have contaminated them.
They were afraid that God might reject them if they\add* had \add touched something unacceptable to
God\add*. 
\v 39 The Lord \add Jesus\add* said to Him, "You Pharisees are \add concerned about things that are outside your bodies, not
with what is in your\add* \add inner beings\f + \ft Or: hearts\add* \f* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. You wash the outside of cups and dishes
\add before you eat because you think that doing that will make you acceptable to
God\add*, but within yourselves you are very greedy and wicked. 
\v 40 You foolish people! \add God\add* is concerned about things that are outside
\add our bodies\add*, but he is certainly also concerned about our inner
\add beings\add*!\f + \ft Or: isn't he also concerned about our hearts? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 41 Give \add money\add* to those who are poor. \add Give according to what you know
within\add* your inner beings\add \f + \ft Or: hearts\add* \f* \add that you should
give\add*. Then you \add will be surprised to realize that\add* you will be acceptable
\add to God without having to perform all those rituals about washing\add*.
\p
\v 42 But there will be terrible punishment for you Pharisees! You give to God a tenth of
\add all you produce, even\add* the various herbs that you grow, but you do not
\add remember that you must act\add* justly \add toward others\add* and love God! It is good to
\add give a tenth of your income to God\add*, but you ought to do these other things also!
\v 43 There will be terrible punishment for you Pharisees, because you like
\add to sit in\add* the best seats in our worship places \add so that people will think highly of
you\add*, and you like people to greet you \add respectfully\add* in the marketplaces.
\v 44 There will be terrible punishment for you, because you are like ground where there is no marker
\add to indicate that there is a\add* grave \add underneath\add*. People walk there, but they cannot see
\add what is rotten down below\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*! \add Similarly, people who see you do not realize how polluted you are within
yourselves\add*." 
\p
\v 45 One of those who taught the \add Jewish\add* laws replied, "Teacher, by saying this
you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* are criticizing us \add also\add*!" 
\v 46 Jesus said, "It will be terrible also for you who teach the
\add Jewish\add* laws! You require people \add to obey many rules that are difficult to
obey\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. \add That is like making them\add* carry heavy burdens on their backs. But you yourselves do not obey the laws
\add that you require others to obey\add*. \f + \ft Or: you do not do anything to help
\add others to obey the laws\add*. \f* 
\v 47 There will be terrible punishment for you! You decorate the tombs of the prophets whom your ancestors killed,
\add but you do not live according to what the prophets taught\add*.
\v 48 So you are declaring that you approve of what your ancestors did. They killed the prophets, and you
\add are not honoring them! You just\add* decorate their tombs! 
\v 49 So God, who is very wise \f + \ft personification \f*, said, 'I will send prophets and apostles
\add to you Jews\add*. \add You\add* will kill some of them and cause some of them to suffer greatly.
\v 50  \add As a result, I\add* will consider that many of you people
\add who have observed my Son's ministry\add* will be guilty \f + \ft metonymy \f*
\add of murder, as if you had\add* killed all the prophets that other people have killed, from the time I created the world,
\v 51 starting from \add Adam's son Cain\add* killing \add his brother\add* Abel and continuing until they killed the prophet
Zechariah \add in the holy place\add* between the altar and the temple.' Yes, what I am saying
\add is true\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*. \add God\add* will punish you people who have observed my ministry whom
\add he\add* considers to be guilty \f + \ft metonymy \f* for \add killing\add* all those prophets!
\v 52 There will be terrible punishment for you men who teach the
\add Jewish\add* laws, because you have \add not let people\add* know
\add God's truth\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*! \add It is as though you are\add* taking away a key
\add to a house\add*. You are not going into \add the house\add* yourselves, and you are not letting other people enter it,
either." 
\p
\v 53 After Jesus finished saying those things, he left there. Then the men who taught the
\add Jewish\add* laws and the Pharisees began to act in a very hostile way toward him. They tried to make him say what he
thought about many things. 
\v 54 They kept waiting for him to say something \add wrong\add* for which they could accuse him.
