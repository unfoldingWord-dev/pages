\c 15  
\s Luke 15:1-10 
\s Jesus taught that God is pleased when people turn from their sinful behavior.
\p
\v 1 Many [HYP] tax collectors and \add others whom people considered to
be\add* habitual sinners kept coming to him to listen to him teach.
\v 2 The Pharisees and men who taught the \add Jewish\add* laws \add who were
there\add* [SYN] began to grumble, saying, “This man welcomes sinners and he also
\add defiles himself by eating\add* with them!” 
\v 3 So Jesus told them this parable: 
\v 4 “Suppose that one of you had a hundred sheep. If one of them were lost,
◄you\add (sg)\add* would certainly leave the ninety-nine sheep in the pastureland, and go and search for the one lost sheep
until you found it./would you not leave the ninety-nine sheep in the pastureland, and go and search for the one lost sheep
until you found it?► [RHQ] 
\v 5 When you\add (sg)\add* found it, you would lay it on your shoulders and be happy.
\v 6 When you brought it home, you would call together your friends and neighbors and say to them, ‘Be happy with me, because I
have found my sheep that was lost!’ 
\v 7 I tell you\add (pl)\add* that similarly\add God\add* will be very happy about each and every sinner who turns from doing
evil. God does not \add need to\add* be happy about ninety-nine people who
\add think that they\add* are [IRO] righteous and think that they do not need to turn from doing evil.
\p
\v 8 Or, suppose that a woman has ten \add very valuable\add* silver coins. If she loses one of them, ◄she will certainly light
a lamp and sweep the floor and search carefully until she finds it!/will she not light a lamp and sweep the floor and search
carefully until she finds it?► [RHQ] 
\v 9 When she finds it, she will call together her friends and neighbors and say, ‘Be happy with me,
\add because\add* I have found the coin that I lost!’ 
\v 10 I tell you that similarly the angels will be happy about \add even
just\add* one sinner who turns from doing evil.” 
\s Luke 15:11-32 
\s Jesus taught the Jewish leaders that they also ought to be glad when people turn from their sinful ways.
\p
\v 11 Then \add he told them this parable to compare what the Pharisees and teachers of the Jewish law thought about those who
turn from their sinful behavior with what God thinks about such people\add*. He said, “A certain man had two sons.
\v 12 One day the younger son said to his father, ‘Father, \add I do not want to wait until you(sg)
die\add*. Give me now the share of your property that belongs to me!’ So the man divided his property between his two sons.
\v 13 A few days later, the younger son \add sold his share\add*. He gathered his money and other things together and went to a
country far away. There he spent all his money foolishly in reckless/wild living.
\v 14 After he had spent all his money, there was a great famine throughout that country. And soon he did not have enough
\add food to\add* eat. 
\v 15 So he went to one of the landowners in that area and asked for work. The man sent him to work taking care of the pigs in
his field. 
\v 16  \add Because he was very hungry\add*, he would have been glad to eat the bean pods that the pigs ate. But no one gave
him anything. 
\v 17 Finally he thought clearly about what he had done. He said to himself, ‘All of my father's hired servants have plenty of
food! They have more [SYN] than they can eat, but here I am dying because I do not have anything to eat [HYP]!
\v 18 So I will leave here and go back to my father. I will say to him, “Father, I have sinned against God [MTY, EUP] and
against you\add (sg)\add*. 
\v 19 I am no longer worthy to be called {of \add you\add* calling me} your son. Just hire me to be like one of the other hired
servants.”’ 
\v 20 So he left there and went back to his father's house. But while he was still some distance from the house, his father saw
him. He pitied him. He ran to his son and embraced him and kissed him
\add on the cheek\add*. 
\v 21 His son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against God [MTY/EUP] and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called {of
\add you\add* calling me} your son.’ 
\v 22 But his father said to his servants, ‘Go quickly and bring to me the best robe
\add in the house!\add* Then put it on my son. Put a ring on his finger
\add to show that I am honoring him again as my son!\add* Put sandals on his feet
\add to show that I do not consider him as a slave!\add* 
\v 23 Then bring the fat calf and kill it \add and cook it\add*!
We\add (inc)\add* must eat and celebrate, 
\v 24 because this is my son! \add It is as though\add* [MET] he was dead and is alive again!
\add It is as though\add* he was lost and now has been found!’ So they did that, and they all began to celebrate.
\p
\v 25 While all that was happening, his older son was out \add working\add* in the field. When he came near to the house, he
heard \add people playing\add* music and dancing. 
\v 26 He called one of the servants and asked what was happening.
\v 27 The servant said to him, ‘Your \add younger\add* brother has come
\add home\add*! Your father has \add told us to\add* kill the fat calf
\add to celebrate\add* because your brother has returned safe and healthy.’
\v 28  \add But\add* the older brother was angry. He refused to enter
\add the house\add*. So his father came out and pleaded with him
\add to come in\add*. 
\v 29 But he replied to his father, ‘Listen to me! For many years I have worked for you like a slave. I always obeyed
everything you told me to do. But you never even gave me a young goat, so that I could
\add kill it and cook it and\add* celebrate with my friends. 
\v 30 But this son of yours spent all the \add money he got from\add* what you gave him. He spent it
\add to pay for sleeping with\add* prostitutes! Now he has returned home,
\add but it is not fair that\add* you have told your \add servants\add* to kill the fat calf
\add and cook it\add* for him!’ 
\v 31 But his father said to him, ‘My son, you have always been with me, and all my property
\add that I did not give to your brother\add* has been yours. 
\v 32 But \add it is as though\add* [MET] your brother was dead and is alive again!
\add It is as though\add* he was lost and now he has been found! So it is appropriate for us to be happy and celebrate!’ ”
