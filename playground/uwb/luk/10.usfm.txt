\c 10  
\s Luke 10:1-12 
\s Jesus instructed seventy-two other disciples before sending them out.
\p
\v 1 After that, the Lord \add Jesus\add* appointed seventy-two other
\add people\add*. He \add prepared to\add* send them out, two-by-two, to every town and village where he \f + \ft synecdoche \f* intended to go.
\v 2 He said to them, "The \add people who are ready to receive my
message\add* are like a field \add of\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add grain\add* that is ready for
\add people\add* to harvest {to be harvested}. But there are not many people
\add to bring them to God\add*. So pray and ask the Lord \add God\add* to send
\add more\add* workers\add who will gather people together and teach them my message, just like a landowner sends
workers\add* into his fields \add to gather the\add* harvest. 
\v 3 Start going; but \add remember that\add* I am sending you\add \f + \ft plural \f*\add* out
\add to tell my message to people who will try to get rid of you. You will
be\add* like lambs among wolves. 
\v 4 Do not take along \add any money in\add* a purse. Do not take a traveler's bag. Do not take
\add extra\add* sandals. Do not \add spend a lot of time\add* greeting people along the way.
\v 5 Whenever you enter a house \add to lodge there\add*, first say to those people, 'May
\add God give inner\add* peace to \add you people\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add in\add* this house!'
\v 6 If people who \add live\add* there \add are desiring to have\add*\f + \ft Or: worthy of receiving \f*
\add God's\add* peace, they will experience the \add inner\add* peace that you are
\add offering them\add*. If people who \add live\add* there \add are not desiring to have
God's\add* peace, you \add will experience God's inner\add* peace,
\add but they will not\add*. 
\v 7  \add If they welcome you\add*, stay in that same house \add until you leave that
village\add*. Do not move around from one house to another. Eat and drink whatever they provide for you. A worker deserves to
get pay \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add from the people for whom he works, so you deserve to receive food and a place to stay from the people to
whom you go\add*. 
\v 8 Whenever you enter a town and the people \add there\add* welcome you, eat what is provided {what
\add they\add* provide} for you. 
\v 9 Heal the people there who are sick. Tell them, 'It is almost
\add time for\add* God to send his king to rule \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add your lives\add*.'
\v 10 But if you enter a town whose \add people\add* do not welcome you, go into its
\add main\add* streets and say, 
\v 11 '\add Because you have refused to hear our message, we\f + \ft exclusive \f* will not only
leave\add*, we will also shake off the dust of your town that clings to our sandals, to warn you
\add that God will reject\f + \ft Or: punish \f* you\add*. But \add we want you to know
that\add* it is almost \add the time when\add* God will start to rule!'
\v 12 I will tell you this: On the \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add final\add* day when
\add God judges everyone\add*, he will punish the wicked people \f + \ft metonymy \f* who long ago lived in Sodom,
\add the city that he destroyed because its people were so wicked\add*. But he will punish
\add even\add* more severely the people \f + \ft metonymy \f* of that town \add who refused to hear your
message\add*!" 
\s Luke 10:13-16 
\s Jesus warned the unbelievers in three towns. 
\p
\v 13 "There will be terrible \add punishment\add* for \add you people who live
in\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* Chorazin and Bethsaida \add cities\add*! I did great miracles in your cities
\add to show God's power, but you did not turn from your sinful behavior\add*. If the miracles that I performed in your
\add cities\add* had been done in Tyre and Sidon \add cities\add*, the wicked people who lived there would have long ago
\add shown that they were sorry for their sins by\add* sitting on the ground wearing coarse cloth and putting ashes on their
heads. 
\v 14  \add But they did not have the opportunity that you have, so when God punishes people, he will punish the wicked people
who lived in\add* Tyre and Sidon, but he will punish you more severely
\add because you did not pay attention to my message\add*! 
\v 15  \add I also have something to say to\add* you\add people who live
in\add* Capernaum \add city\add*. Do not \add think that you will be
honored\add* {\add that God\add* will honor you} in heaven!\f + \ft Or: Do you
\add think that you will be honored\add* {\add that God\add* will honor you} in heaven? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\add That will not happen! On the contrary\add*, \add after you die,
God\add* will send you down to the place where \add sinful people\add* will be punished
\add forever\add*!" 
\p
\v 16  \add Jesus also said to the disciples, "God will consider
that\add* those who listen to your \add message\add* are listening to me, and that those who reject your
\add message\add* are rejecting me. And \add he will consider that\add* those who reject me are rejecting
\add God\add*, the one who sent me." 
\s Luke 10:17-24 
\s Jesus commented on their ministry after the seventy-two returned.
\p
\v 17 The seventy-two \add people whom Jesus appointed went and did as he told them
to\add*. When they returned, they were very joyful. They said, "Lord,
\add people did what we\f + \ft exclusive \f* told them to do! But\add* demons also obeyed us when by
your\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* authority \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add we commanded them to leave
people\add*!" 
\v 18 He replied, "\add When those demons were obeying you, because God had enabled you to defeat them, it was as
though\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* I saw Satan fall from heaven \add as suddenly and
quickly\add* as lightning \add strikes\add*! 
\v 19 Listen! I have given you authority so that if you oppose evil spirits \f + \ft metaphor \f*
\add they will not hurt you\add*. I have given you authority to defeat our enemy,
\add Satan\add*. Nothing shall hurt you. 
\v 20 But \add although\add* you can rejoice that evil spirits obey you, you should rejoice
\add more\add* that your names have been written {that \add God\add* has written your names} in heaven,
\add because you will be with God forever\add*." 
\p
\v 21 At that time the Holy Spirit caused \add Jesus\add* to be very happy. He said, "Father,
you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* rule over \add everything in\add* heaven and \add on\add* the earth! Some
\add people think that they are\add* wise \add because\add* they are well-educated. But I thank you that you have prevented
them from \add knowing\add* these things\add . Instead\add*, you have revealed them to
\add people who accept your truth as readily\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add as\add* little children
\add do\add*. Yes, Father, \add you have done that\add* because it seemed good to you
\add to do\add* so." 
\v 22  \add Jesus also said to the 72 disciples\add*, "\add God\add*, my Father, has revealed to me all
\add I need to know and the power I need for my work\add*. Only my Father knows who I
\add really\add* am. Furthermore, only I and those \add people\add* to whom I wish to reveal him know what
\add God\add* my Father is \add like\add*." 
\p
\v 23 Then when his disciples were alone with him, he turned toward them and said,
"\add God\add* is pleased with you \f + \ft synecdoche \f* who have seen \add the things that I have
done\add*! 
\v 24 I want you to know that many prophets and kings \add who lived long
ago\add* desired to see the things that you are seeing \add me do\add*, but those things did not
\add happen\add* then. They longed to hear the things that you have been hearing
\add me say\add*, but \add I\add* did not \add reveal them\add* then."
\s Luke 10:25-37 
\s Jesus taught that we must show our love to everyone, even ones we do not like to associate with.
\p
\v 25  \add One day as Jesus was teaching people\add*, a man who had studied carefully the laws that
\add God gave Moses\add* was there. He wanted to ask Jesus a difficult question. So he stood up and asked, "Teacher, what shall
I do in order to live \add with God\add* forever?" 
\v 26 Jesus said to him, "You\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* have read \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* what
\add Moses\add* has written in the laws that \add God gave him\add*. What did Moses write about that?"
\v 27 The man replied, "\add He wrote that\add* we\add \f + \ft inclusive \f*\add* must love the Lord our God in our inner beings\f + \ft Or: hearts \f*.
\add We must show that\add* by what we feel and by what we do and by what we think.
\add He\add* also \add wrote that we must love\add* people that we come in contact with as much as
\add we love\add* ourselves." 
\v 28 Jesus replied, "You\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* have answered \add your question\add* correctly. If you do all that
\add continually\add*, you will live \add with God forever\add*."
\p
\v 29 But the man wanted to defend \add the way\add* he \add acted toward people that he came in contact
with\add* \f + \ft Or: to defend why he \add had asked a question that Jesus answered so
simply\add* \f*. So he said to Jesus, "Which people that I come in contact with
\add should I love\add*?" 
\v 30 Jesus replied \add by telling him this illustration\add*: "A
\add Jewish\add* man was once going down along the road from Jerusalem to Jericho. Bandits attacked him. They took away
\add most of\add* the man's clothes \add and everything else that he
had\add*, and they beat him until he was almost dead. Then they left him.
\v 31 It happened that a \add Jewish\add* priest was going along that road. When he saw that man,
\add instead of helping him\add*, he passed by on the other side
\add of the road\add*. 
\v 32 Similarly, a man who worked in the temple \add in Jerusalem\add* came to that place and saw the man. But he also passed
by on the other side \add of the road\add*. 
\v 33 Then a man from Samaria \add province\add* came along that road to where the man was lying.
\add People from Samaria despise Jews. But\add* when he saw that man, he pitied him.
\v 34 He went close to him and put some \add olive\add* oil and wine on the wounds
\add to help heal them\add*. He wound strips of cloth \add around the
wounds\add*. He placed the man on his own donkey and took him to an inn and took care of him.
\v 35 The next morning he gave two silver coins to the innkeeper and said, 'Take care of this man. If
you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* spend more than this amount \add to care for him\add*, I will pay you back when I return.'"
\v 36 Then Jesus said, "Three people \add saw\add* the man whom bandits attacked. Which one of them
\add acted in a loving way toward\add* that man?" 
\v 37 The man who studied the Scriptures replied, "The one who acted mercifully toward him." Jesus said to him,
"You\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* go and act like that \add toward\add* everyone whom
\add you can help\add*!" 
\s Luke 10:38-42 
\s Jesus rebuked Martha for being too concerned about household chores.
\p
\v 38 As Jesus and his disciples continued to travel, they entered a village
\add near Jerusalem\add*. A woman whose name was Martha invited them to come to her house.
\v 39 Her \add younger\add* sister, whose name was Mary, was sitting near Jesus. She was listening to what he was teaching.
\v 40 But Martha was very much concerned about preparing \add the
meal\add*. She went to Jesus and said, "Lord, do you not care that my sister has left me to prepare everything by myself?\f + \ft Or: you
do not seem to care that my sister has left me to prepare everything by myself! \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* Tell her that she should help me!"
\v 41 But the Lord replied, "Martha, Martha, you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* are very worried about many things.
\v 42 But only one thing is truly necessary, and that is, \add to listen to what I am
teaching\add*. Mary has decided to \add do that\add*, and that is better.
\add The blessing that she is receiving from doing that\add* will not be taken away from her {No one will take away from her
\add the blessing that she is receiving from doing that\add*}."
