\c 5  
\s Luke 5:1-11 
\s Jesus chose some fishermen to be his disciples. 
\p
\v 1 One day while many people were crowding around him to hear the message from God, Jesus was standing on the shore of
Gennesaret Lake, \add which is also called Lake Galilee\add*. 
\v 2 He saw two \add fishing\add* boats at the edge of the lake. The fishermen had gone out of the boats and were washing their
\add fishing\add* nets \add on the shore\add*. One of the boats belonged to Simon.
\v 3 Jesus got in that boat and asked Simon to push the boat a little bit away from the shore
\add so that he could speak to the crowd more easily. Jesus\add* sat in the boat and taught the people
\add who were on the shore\add*. 
\v 4 After he finished speaking \add to them\add*, he said to Simon, “Push the boat out to where the water is deep. Then let
your nets down \add into the water\add* to catch \add some fish\add*!”
\v 5 Simon replied, “Master, we\add (exc)\add* worked hard all night but we did not catch any
\add fish\add*! But because you\add (sg)\add* tell me to do it, I will let down the nets.”
\v 6 When Peter \add and the men with him\add* had done that, they caught so many fish that their nets were breaking.
\v 7 They motioned to their partners in the other boat to come and help them. So they came and filled both the boats
\add with fish from the net\add*. The result was that the boats were so full that they began to sink.
\v 8-9 Simon and all the men who were with him were amazed at how many fish they had taken. James and John, the two sons of
Zebedee, who were Simon's partners, were among those who were amazed. When Simon,
\add whose other name was\add* Peter, saw \add the fish, feeling ashamed to be in the presence of someone who obviously had
God's power\add*, he prostrated himself before Jesus and said, “Lord, you should go away from me, because I am a sinful man!”
\v 10 But Jesus said to Simon, “Do not be afraid! \add Up until now you(sg) have been gathering
fish\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f*, but from now on you will gather people \add to become my
disciples\add*.” 
\v 11 So after they brought the boats to the shore, they left their business \f + \fr hyperbole \f*
\add in the hands of others\add* and went with Jesus. 
\s Luke 5:12-16 
\s Jesus healed a leper and enabled him to associate with people again.
\p
\v 12 While \add Jesus\add* was in one of the cities \add there in the district of
Galilee\add*, there was a man there who was very severely affected by leprosy. When he saw Jesus, he prostrated himself before
him and, \add wanting Jesus to heal him\add*, pleaded with him, “Lord/Sir,
\add please heal me, because\add* you are able to heal me if you are willing to!”
\v 13  \add Then Jesus, disregarding the religious law that forbade people to come close to
lepers\add*, reached out his hand and touched the man. He said, “I am willing
\add to heal you\add*; and I heal you now!” Immediately the man \add was
healed\add*. He was no longer a leper \f + \fr personification \f*! 
\v 14 Then Jesus told him, “Make sure that you do not report \add your healing immediately. First, go to a priest in
Jerusalem\add* and show yourself to him \add so that he can examine you and verify that you no longer have
leprosy\add*. After the priest tells\add the local people\add*, they will know that
\add you have been healed, and you will be able to associate with them
again\add*. Also take to the priest \add the offering\add* that Moses commanded
\add that people who have been healed from leprosy should offer\add*.”
\v 15 But many people heard the man's report of what \add Jesus had
done\add*. The result was that large crowds came to Jesus to hear his
\add message\add* and to be healed of their sicknesses {so that he would heal their sicknesses}.
\v 16 But he often would go away from them to the desolate area and pray.
\s Luke 5:17-26 
\s By healing a paralyzed man Jesus showed that he had authority to forgive sins, too.
\p
\v 17 One day when \add Jesus\add* was teaching, some men from the Pharisee
\add sect\add* were sitting there. Some of them were men who taught the
\add Jewish\add* laws. They had come from many \f + \fr hyperbole \f* villages in Galilee
\add district\add* and also from Jerusalem and from \add other\add* villages in Judea
\add district\add*. \add At that time while\add* God was giving Jesus power to heal people,
\v 18 several men brought on a sleeping pad a man who was paralyzed. They wanted to bring him into
\add the house\add* and lay him in front of Jesus. 
\v 19 But there was no way to do that because of the large crowd of people, so they went up
\add the steps\add* onto the roof. They tied ropes onto the sleeping pad and, after
\add removing some of\add* the tiles on the roof, they lowered the man
\add on\add* the sleeping pad. They lowered him through the opening into the midst of the crowd in front of Jesus.
\v 20 When Jesus perceived that they believed that \add he could heal the
man\add*, he said to him, “My friend, \add I\add* forgive your sins!”
\v 21 The men who taught the \add Jewish\add* laws and the rest of the Pharisees began to question within themselves, “Who does
this man \add think he is, saying\add* that? He is insulting God! ◄Nobody can forgive sins!/What person can forgive sins?►
\f + \fr rhetorical question \f* Only God can do that!” 
\v 22 Jesus perceived what they were thinking. So he said to them, “◄You should not question within yourselves
\add about what I said!\add*/Why do you question within yourselves
\add about what I said\add*?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* \add Consider this\add*: 
\v 23 It would \add not\add* be risky \add for someone\add* to say
\add to this man\add*, ‘\add I\add* forgive your sins,’ \add because no one could see whether or not his sins were really
forgiven. But no one\add* \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*\add , without having the power to
heal\add*, would say to \add him\add*, ‘Get up and walk!’ \add because people could easily see whether he was healed or
not\add*. 
\v 24 But \add as a result of my healing this man\add* you\add (pl)\add* will know that
\add God\add* has authorized \add me\add*, the one who came from heaven, to forgive the sins
\add of people while I am on\add* the earth, \add as well as to heal
people\add*.” Then he said to the man who was paralyzed, “To you I say, ‘Get up, pick up your sleeping pad, and go home!’”
\v 25 Immediately the man \add was healed\add*! He got up in front of them. He picked up the
\add sleeping pad\add* on which he had been lying, and he went home, praising God.
\v 26 All the people \add there\add* were amazed! They praised God and were completely awestruck. They kept saying,
“We\add (inc)\add* have seen wonderful things today!” 
\s Luke 5:27-32 
\s Jesus answered criticism about associating with sinful people.
\p
\v 27 Then \add Jesus\add* left \add the town\add* and saw a man who collected taxes
\add for the Roman government\add*. His name was Levi. He was sitting in the booth where he collected the taxes. Jesus said to
him, “Come with me \add and become my disciple\add*!” 
\v 28 So Levi left his work \f + \fr hyperbole \f* and went with Jesus. 
\p
\v 29 Afterwards, Levi prepared a big feast in his own house \add for Jesus and his
disciples\add*. There was a large group of tax collectors and others eating together with them.
\v 30 The men who were there who taught the \add Jewish\add* laws, ones who belonged to the Pharisee
\add sect\add*, complained to Jesus' disciples, saying, “◄\add It is disgusting
that\add* you are eating with tax collectors and\add others who we(exc) consider to
be\add* sinners!/Why are you eating with tax collectors \add and others who we(exc) consider to
be\add* sinners?►” \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* 
\v 31 Then, \add to indicate that it was those who knew that they had sinned who were coming to him for
help\add*, Jesus said to them, “\add It is\add* people who are sick who need a doctor, not those who are well \f + \fr metaphor \f*.
\v 32  \add Similarly\add*, I did not come \add from heaven\add* to invite
\add those who think they are\add* righteous \add to come to me\add*. On the contrary,
\add I came to invite those who know that they are\add* sinners to turn from their sinful
behavior\add and come to me\add*.” 
\s Luke 5:33-39 
\s Jesus explained that people could not follow both their old customs and his new teaching.
\p
\v 33  \add Those Jewish leaders\add* said to Jesus, “The disciples of John
\add the Baptizer\add* often abstain from food \add to show that they want to please
God\add*, and the disciples of the Pharisees do that, too. But your disciples keep on eating and drinking!
\add Why do not they fast like the others\add*?” 
\v 34  \add To show them that it was not appropriate for his disciples to be sad and abstain from food while he was still with
them\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f*, Jesus said to them, “When ◄the bridegroom/man who is getting married► is with
\add his friends at the time of the wedding\add*, you certainly do not make his friends abstain from food, do you \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*?
\add No, you do not do that\add*. 
\v 35  \add But\add* some day he will be taken away {\add his enemies\add* will take him away} from them. Then, at that time,
his friends will abstain from food, \add because they will be sad\add*.”
\p
\v 36 Then Jesus told them two parables \add to show them that those who desire to live according to God's new message should
not be forced to obey the old religious traditions like\add* ◄\add fasting/abstaining from
food\add*►\add , and that those who know only the old traditions are not eager to accept new
ones\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f*. He said, “People never tear a piece of cloth from a new garment and attach it to an old garment
\add to mend it\add*. If they did that, not only would they be ruining the new garment by tearing it, but the new piece of
cloth would not match the old garment. 
\v 37 Neither does anyone put freshly-\add squeezed\add* grape juice into old skin bags
\add to store it\add*. If anyone did that, the grape juice would burst the skin bags
\add because they would not stretch when the\add* new \add wine ferments and expands.
Then\add* the skin bags would be ruined, and\add the wine\add* would\add also\add* be spilled.
\v 38 On the contrary, new wine must be put into new wineskins. 
\p
\v 39 Furthermore, those who have drunk \add only\add* old wine \add are content with
that\add*. They do not want to drink the new wine, because they say, ‘The old wine is \f + \fr metaphor \f* good!’ ”
