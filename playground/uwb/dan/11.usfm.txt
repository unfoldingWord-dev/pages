\v 1 As for me, during the first year that Darius was king, I helped and encouraged him.
\s The message about the kings of Egypt and Syria 
\p
\v 2  \add The angel also said\add*, "And what I am going to reveal to you now will truly
\add happen\add*. There will be three more kings to rule Persia,
\add one after the other\add*. Then there will be a fourth king, who will be much richer than the others. As a result of
\add his giving\add* a lot of money \add to people, they will enable him
to\add* become very powerful. Then he will incite\f + \ft Or: persuade \f* many nations \f + \ft hyperbole \f*
\add to fight\add* against the kingdom of Greece. 
\p
\v 3 Then a very powerful king will appear \add in Greece\add*. He will rule over a very large empire, and he will do whatever
he wants to do. 
\v 4 But when he has become very powerful, \add he will die\add*. Then his kingdom will be divided into four parts. Kings who
are not his descendants will rule, but they will not be as powerful as he was.
\v 5 Then the king of Egypt \f + \ft metonymy \f* will become very powerful. But one of his army generals will become more powerful than he is,
and he will rule a bigger area. 
\v 6 Several years later, the king of Egypt and the king of Syria will make an alliance\f + \ft Or: agreement to help each other \f* \f + \ft metonymy \f*.
The king of Syria will give his daughter to the king of Egypt to become his wife. But she will not be able to influence him
\f + \ft metonymy \f* very long, and that woman, her husband, her child, and her servants will all be killed\f + \ft Or: assassinated \f*.
\p
\v 7 Soon after that, one of her relatives \f + \ft metaphor \f* will become king
\add of Egypt\add*. His army will attack the army of Syria. They will enter the fortress of the soldiers of Syria and defeat
them. 
\v 8 They will return to Egypt, taking the statues of the gods \add of the people of
Syria\add* and many items made of silver and gold that had been dedicated to those gods. Then for several years his army will
not attack \add the army of\add* the king of Syria. 
\v 9 Then the army of the king of Syria will invade Egypt, but they will soon return to Syria.
\v 10 However, the sons of the king of Syria will prepare to start a war, and they will gather a large army. That army will
march \add south\add* and spread all over \add Israel\add* like a huge flood. They will attack a strong fortress
\add in the south of Israel\add*. 
\p
\v 11 Then the king of Egypt, having become very angry, will march
\add with his army\add* \add north\add* from Egypt and fight against the army of Syria. The king
\add of Syria\add* will gather together a very large army, but \add the army of the king of
Egypt\add* will defeat them. 
\v 12 The king of Egypt will become very proud because of \add his
army\add* having killed a very large number of soldiers \add from
Syria\add*, but his army will not continue to win battles. 
\v 13 The king of Syria will again gather together an army that will be bigger than the one that he had before. After a few
years, he will again march \add south on their way to Egypt\add* with a large army and a lot of equipment
\add for fighting battles\add*. 
\p
\v 14 At that time, many people in Egypt will rebel against their king. In order to fulfill a vision that
\add one of their leaders had seen\add*, some violent\f + \ft Or: lawless \f* people from your country
\add of Israel\add* will also rebel \add in order to not be controlled by Egypt
anymore\add*, but they will be defeated. 
\v 15 Then the king of Syria will come \add south with his army\add* and pile up dirt against the walls of a city that is well
protected, and they will \add break through those walls and\add* they will capture the city. The soldiers from Egypt
\add who have come to defend that city\add*, even the best troops, will not be strong enough to continue to fight.
\v 16 So the king of Syria will do whatever he wants to, and no one will be able to oppose him.
\add His army\add* will occupy the glorious land \add of Israel\add* and completely control\f + \ft Or: subdue \f* it.
\v 17 Then he will decide to march \add south\add* with all the soldiers from his kingdom. He will make an alliance with the
king \add of Egypt\add* and in order that his daughter will \add help him
to\add* destroy the kingdom of Egypt, he will give her to the king of Egypt to become his wife. But that plan will fail.
\v 18 After that, the \add army of\add* the king of Syria will attack the regions that are close to the
\add Mediterranean\add* Sea, and his \add army\add* will conquer many of them. But
\add the army of\add* a leader from another country will defeat the army of Syria and will stop their king from continuing to
be proud. He will do to the king of Syria what he deserved for being very insolent.
\v 19 Then the king of Syria will return to the fortresses in his own land. But he will be defeated, and he will die\f + \ft Or: be
assassinated \f* \f + \ft euphemism \f* there. 
\p
\v 20 Then another king will succeed him\f + \ft Or: become king \f*. That king will send one of his officers to oppress the people
\add in Jerusalem\add* by forcing them to pay big taxes, in order to get more money for his kingdom. But after a few years
\f + \ft hyperbole \f* that king will die, but he will not die as a result of people being angry with him or in a battle.
\p
\v 21 Becoming the next king of Syria will be an evil man who, \add because he will not be the son of the previous
king\add*, will not have the right to become king. But he will come when people do not expect it, and he will become king by
tricking the people. 
\v 22 When his army advances, they will attack any armies that oppose him and destroy those armies. They will also kill God's
Supreme Priest. 
\v 23 By making treaties\f + \ft Or: alliances \f* with \add the rulers of\add* other nations, he will deceive them, and he will become very
powerful, even though he rules a nation that does not have a lot of people.
\v 24 Suddenly his \add army\add* will invade a province that is very wealthy, and they will do things that none of his
ancestors did: they will capture in battles all kinds of possessions from the people whom they defeat. Then the king will
divide those possessions among his friends. He will also plan \add for his
army\add* to attack fortresses \add in Egypt\add*, but only for a short time.
\p
\v 25 He will courageously\f + \ft Or: boldly \f* conscript\f + \ft Or: gather \f* a large and powerful army to attack
\add the army of\add* the king of Egypt. But the king of Egypt will prepare to fight against them with a huge and powerful
army. However, someone will deceive him, with the result that his plan will not be successful.
\v 26 Even his most trusted advisors will plan to get rid of him. His army will be defeated and many of his soldiers will be
killed. 
\v 27 Then the two \add men who both want to be the king\add* will sit down at the same table and eat together, but they will
both lie to each other. Neither of them will get what he wants, because it will not be the time
\add that God\add* has determined\f + \ft Or: set \f* \add for them to rule\add*.
\v 28  \add The army of\add* the king \add of Syria\add* will return to Syria, taking with them all the valuable things
\add that they have captured\add*. The king will be determined to get rid of the Supreme Priest of the Jewish people. He will
do what he wants to \add in Israel\add*, and then return to his own country.
\p
\v 29 When it is the time that God has decided, the king of Syria
\add and his army\add* will invade Egypt again. But this time he will not be successful like he was before.
\v 30 The army of Rome will come in ships and oppose his army and cause him to be afraid. So he will be very angry, and
\add with his army\add* he will return \add to Israel\add* and try to get rid of the Supreme Priest. The king of Syria will do
what those who have abandoned the Jewish religion advise\f + \ft Or: want \f* him to do for them.
\v 31 Some of his soldiers will do things to defile the temple\f + \ft Or: cause the temple to become unholy for them \f*. They will prevent
the priests from offering sacrifices each day, and they will put
\add in the temple\add* something that is disgusting\f + \ft Or: abominable \f*.
\p
\v 32 By deceiving those who have abandoned the Jewish religion, he will win them to become his supporters\f + \ft Or: help him to do what
he wants to do \f*. But those who are devoted to their God will firmly oppose them.
\v 33 And wise \add Israeli\add* leaders will teach others also. But for a while, some of those wise leaders will be killed in
battles, and some will be burned to death, and some will be robbed, and some will be put in prison.
\p
\v 34 While God's people are being persecuted, some people will help them a little bit, although some of those who help them
will not do it sincerely. 
\v 35 Some of those wise leaders will be killed \f + \ft euphemism \f*, but as a result the others will be purified \f + \ft doublet \f*. This suffering will
continue until it is the time \add that God\add* has appointed \add for it
to\add* end. 
\s The king of Syria who praises himself 
\p
\v 36 The king \add of Syria\add* will do what he wants to. He will boast and say that he is greater than any god. He will even
revile the Supreme God. He will be able to do what he wants until the time that
\add God\add* punishes \f + \ft metonymy \f* him. \add God\add* will accomplish what he has planned.
\v 37 The \add king of Syria\add* will ignore the god that his ancestors worshiped and the god that many women love. He will
ignore every god, because he will think that he is greater than all of them.
\v 38 But he will honor the god who \add people think\add* protects fortresses. That is a god whom his ancestors did not honor.
And he will give gold, silver, jewels\f + \ft Or: very valuable stones \f* and other expensive gifts to that god.
\v 39 He will ask that god \f + \ft Or: people who worship a god \f* from another country to help him to defend his fortresses. He will
greatly honor those who allow him \add to be their ruler\add*. He will appoint
\add some of\add* them to important positions in the government; and to reward them, he will give them some land.
\p
\v 40 But when his time \add to rule\add* is almost ended, \add the army
of\add* the king of Egypt will attack his \add army\add*. The \add army of
the\add* king of Syria will fight against them furiously \f + \ft simile \f*. \add His soldiers will be
driving\add* chariots and \add riding on\add* horses and \add traveling
in\add* many ships. His army will invade many countries and \add spread all over those
countries\add* like a flood \f + \ft metaphor \f*. 
\v 41 They will invade the glorious land \add of Israel\add* and kill \f + \ft euphemism \f* tens of thousands of people. But the people of the
Edom people-group and the people of the Moab people-group and the people of the Ammon people-group who are still alive will
escape. 
\v 42 When the army of Syria invades other countries, even the people of Egypt will be defeated.
\v 43 The army of Syria will take away from Egypt gold, silver, and other valuable items. The people of Libya and Ethiopia will
allow \add the king of Syria\add* to rule over them. 
\v 44 But he will become very frightened\f + \ft Or: alarmed \f* when he hears reports about what is happening in the east and in the north. So
he will become very angry, and send his army to fight furiously and kill many
\add of their enemies\add*. 
\v 45 The \add king of Syria\add* will set up his royal tents in the area between the
\add Mediterranean\add* Sea and the hill \add in Jerusalem\add* on which the temple exists\f + \ft Or: was built \f*. But he will be killed
there, because there will be no one to help him."
