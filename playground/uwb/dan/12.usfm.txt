\c 12  
\s When this world will end 
\p
\v 1  \add The angel also said to me\add*, “After those things happen, the great angel Michael, who protects the
\add Israeli\add* people, will appear. Then there will be a time when there will be great troubles\f + \ft Or: suffering \f*. The troubles will
be greater than any troubles\f + \ft Or: suffering \f* since the nations began. At that time, all of your people whose names have been written
in the book \add containing the names of those who have eternal life\add* will be saved.
\v 2 Many of those who have died \f + \ft euphemism \f* will become alive again. Some of them will live eternally
\add with God\add*, and some will be eternally shamed\f + \ft Or: disgraced \f* \add in
hell\add*. 
\v 3 Those who were wise will shine as brightly as the sky \add is bright when the sun is
shining\add*. And those who have shown to others the way to live righteously will shine forever, like the stars \f + \ft simile \f*.
\v 4 But as for you, Daniel, close up the scroll\f + \ft Or: book \f* \add in which you are
writing\add*, and seal it \add in order that no one can open it\add* until the end
\add of the world\add* is near. At that time\f + \ft Or: Meanwhile \f*, many people will travel rapidly here and there, leaning more and more
\add about many things\add*.” 
\p
\v 5 When \add that angel finished speaking\add*, I, Daniel, looked up, and suddenly I saw two other
\add angels\add*. One was standing on the side of the river \add where I
was\add*, and one was standing on the other side. 
\v 6 One of them \add called to\add* the other one, who was wearing linen\f + \ft Or: white \f* clothes, who was now standing further up \f + \ft Or:
above) the river, “How long will it be until these amazing( Or: frightening ) events end?”
\p
\v 7 The angel who was on the other side of (OR, above \f* the river raised his hands toward the sky, and solemnly promised, with
the authority \f + \ft metonymy \f* of God, who lives forever, “It will be three and a half years. All these things will end after God's people
stop fighting against those who persecute\f + \ft Or: cause trouble for, Or: cause suffering for \f* them.”
\p
\v 8 I heard \add what he said\add*, but I did not understand it. So I asked, “Sir, what will be the result when these things
end?” 
\p
\v 9 He replied, “Daniel, you must leave now. \add I cannot answer your
question\add* because what it means must be kept secret\f + \ft Or: not be revealed \f* \f + \ft doublet \f* until the time when everything ends.
\v 10 Many people will thoroughly purify their inner beings \f + \ft doublet \f*. But wicked people will not understand these things. They
will continue to be wicked. Only those who are wise will understand
\add these things\add*. 
\v 11  \add But I can tell you that before everything ends\add*, there will be 1290 days, from the time that people are
prevented from offering sacrifices each day, that is, from the time that the abominable\f + \ft Or: disgusting \f* thing is put in the temple.
\v 12 God will be pleased with those who remain faithful until 1335 days are ended.
\p
\v 13 So \add now I say\add* to you, continue to faithfully \add trust
God\add* until \add your life on earth\add* ends. You will die \f + \ft euphemism \f*, but when everything ends, you will receive your reward
\add from God\add*.”
