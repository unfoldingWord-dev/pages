\c 9  
\s Daniel's prayer 
\p
\v 1  \add Several years later\add* Darius, who was from the Mede people-group, and who was the son of Xerxes, became the king
of Babylonia. 
\v 2 During the first year that he was the king, I, Daniel, was studying/reading in the holy books/Scriptures the message that
Yahweh had given to the prophet Jeremiah. In that message Jeremiah had written that Jerusalem would
\add be destroyed and\add* remain ruined for seventy years. 
\v 3  \add After I read that\add*, I pleaded to Yahweh my God \add to help
us\add*, praying and ◄fasting/abstaining from eating food►. \add While doing that, I was
wearing\add* rough cloth and sitting in ashes \add to show that I was very sad about what had happened to
us\add*. 
\p
\v 4 I confessed the sins that we had committed, and this is what I prayed:
\b
\pi Lord, you are great and awesome! You have faithfully done what you said that you would do for us. You faithfully love those
who love you and who do what you have commanded \add that we should
do\add*. 
\v 5 But we \add Israelis\add* have sinned. We have done things that are wrong. We have done wicked things, and we have
rebelled against you. We have turned away from \add obeying\add* your commands [DOU].
\v 6 Your prophets spoke for you [MTY], \add giving your messages
to\add* our kings, to our other rulers, to our other ancestors, and to all the Israeli people, but we have not ◄paid attention
to/heeded► those prophets. 
\pi
\v 7 Lord, you always do what is righteous/just/fair, but we have caused ourselves to be ashamed [IDI]. This is still true
about all of the Israelis who live in Jerusalem and who live in other places in Judea. It is also true about all us Israelis
whom you scattered, who \add were taken to\add* other countries, some near here and some far away, because we were very
unfaithful/disloyal to you. 
\v 8 Lord, we and our kings and our other rulers and our other ancestors have done very shameful things and have sinned against
you. 
\v 9 Although we have rebelled against you, you act mercifully toward us and you
\add are willing/ready\add* to forgive us. 
\v 10 Yahweh our God, when you gave your laws to your prophets who served you, and they told us to conduct our lives according
to those laws, we did not ◄listen to/heed► you. 
\v 11 All of us Israeli people have disobeyed your laws, and we have turned away from
\add obeying\add* what you said. We have sinned against you. As a result, you have caused us to experience the terrible things
that your servant Moses said/wrote \add would happen to us\add* if we sinned against you.
\pi
\v 12 You warned us and our rulers that you would punish Jerusalem severely by causing a great disaster there, a disaster that
would be worse than any disaster that any other city had ever experienced, and you have done what you said that you would do.
\v 13 You punished us just like Moses wrote that you would do. But Yahweh our God, we still have not tried, by turning away
from our sinning and by heeding your truth, to persuade you to act mercifully toward us.
\v 14 So, because we did not obey you, you prepared to punish us, and then you did punish us, because you always do what is
righteous/just/fair. 
\pi
\v 15 Lord our God, you brought your people out of Egypt by your great power [MTY], and by doing that you have caused people
from that time until the present time to know that you are great [IDI]
\add even though\add* we have sinned and done wicked things. 
\v 16 Lord, Jerusalem is your city, and \add your temple was built
there\add* on your sacred hill. Now all the people who live in nearby countries/nations despise Jerusalem and us your people
because of our sins and because of the evil things that our ancestors did. But now, because you do what is righteous/just,
\add we request you to\add* not be angry with Jerusalem any longer.
\pi
\v 17 Lord our God, listen to what I am praying and pleading for you to do. ◄For your own sake/In order that people will know
that you are very great►, act kindly [IDI] concerning your temple, which was destroyed
\add by the armies of Babylonia\add*. 
\v 18 My God, listen to \add my prayer\add*. Look at us and see our troubles, and see that this city that belongs to you [MTY]
is ruined/destroyed. We are praying to you because you are merciful, not because we have done what is right/good.
\v 19 Lord, listen to us! Lord, forgive us! Lord, this city and these people belong to you, so
\add we plead with you to\add* heed what we are saying and act \add to help
us\add* right now, ◄for your own sake/in order that people will know that you are very great►!
\s Gabriel told what would happen in the future 
\p
\v 20 I continued praying and confessing the sins that I and my people had committed, and pleading with Yahweh my God that he
would restore \add the temple on\add* the sacred hill \add in Jerusalem\add*.
\v 21 While I was praying, Gabriel, the angel/one whom I had seen in the vision previously, came flying rapidly to me, at the
time in the evening when the priests offered sacrifices. 
\v 22 He said to me, “Daniel, I have come to you to enable you to understand [DOU] clearly
\add the message that God gave to Jeremiah\add*. 
\v 23 When you began to plead with God, he gave me a message \add to give to
you\add*. He loves you very much, so \add he has sent me\add* to tell you what he said to me. So now ◄pay attention/listen
carefully► in order that you may understand the meaning of what he revealed
\add to Jeremiah\add*. 
\p
\v 24 God has determined/declared that there will be 490 years until he frees/saves your people from
\add the guilt of\add* their sins and to atone for the evil things that they have done. Then God will rule everyone justly, and
he will do that forever. And what you saw in the vision and what
\add Jeremiah\add* prophesied will ◄come true/be fulfilled►, and the sacred temple will be dedicated
\add to God again\add*. 
\p
\v 25 You need to know and understand this: there will be 49 years from the time that
\add the king\add* commands that Jerusalem should be rebuilt until the leader/king that God has chosen will come. Then 434
years later, Jerusalem will be rebuilt, and it will have streets and will have a ◄moat/deep ditch filled with water► around it
\add to protect the city\add*. But that will be a time when \add God's
people\add* have a lot of troubles/difficulties/suffering. 
\v 26 After those 434 years, the leader/king whom God has appointed will be killed ◄unjustly/without having done anything
wrong►. After that, the temple will be destroyed by \add the army
of\add* a powerful ruler. The city and the temple will be destroyed like a flood [MET]
\add destroys everything\add*. That will be the beginning of the war and destruction that
\add God\add* has decreed will happen. 
\v 27 That ruler will make a strong agreement with many people. He will promise to do what he has said in that agreement for
seven years. But when that time is half finished, he will prevent priests from giving any more offerings and sacrifices to God.
A disgusting idol will be put on the highest part of the temple, and it will stay there until
\add God\add* gets rid of the one who put it there, which is what he said that he would do.”
