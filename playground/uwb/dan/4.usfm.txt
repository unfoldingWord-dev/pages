\c 4  
\s Nebuchadnezzar dreamed about a tree 
\p
\v 1  \add Several years after\add* Nebuchadnezzar \add started to
rule\add*, he sent this message to the people of every nation and people-group and who spoke every language in his empire. He
wrote, 
\b
\pi I wish\f + \ft Or: hope \f* that all things go very well with you! 
\b
\pi
\v 2 I want you to know about all the wonderful miracles \f + \ft doublet \f* that the Supreme God has performed for me.
\b
\q
\v 3 He performs great miracles, 
\q2 and does wonderful things. 
\q His kingdom will last forever; 
\q2 his rule \add over people\add* will never end. 
\b
\pi
\v 4 I, Nebuchadnezzar, was living in my palace. I was living luxuriantly, and everything was going very well for me.
\v 5 But one night I had a dream that caused me to be very afraid. I saw visions that terrified me as I lay on my bed.
\v 6 So I summoned all the wise men in Babylon, in order that they would come and tell me what it meant.
\v 7 All the men who worked magic, the fortune-tellers, the men who worked sorcery, and men who studied the stars came to me. I
told them what I had dreamed, but they could not tell me what it meant.
\v 8 Finally, Daniel came to me, and I \add decided to\add* tell him what I had dreamed. One of my officials had given him a
new name, Belteshazzar, to honor my own god. I knew that the spirit of the holy gods was in him.
\pi
\v 9 So, \add using the name I had given him\add*, I said, “Belteshazzar, you are the most important of all my fortune-tellers.
I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you, and that you can reveal all mysteries. There is none that is too difficult
for you. So, tell me what my dream means. 
\v 10 This is what I dreamed while I was lying on my bed: I saw a large tree
\add growing\add* in the middle of the land. 
\v 11 The tree was very strong and had grown very tall; \add it seemed
that\add* its top reached up to the sky, with the result that everyone in the world \f + \ft hyperbole \f* could see it.
\v 12 It had beautiful leaves, and it had produced a lot of fruit for people to eat. Wild animals rested in the shade of that
tree, and birds built nests in its branches. All the living creatures everywhere in the world got food from that tree.
\pi
\v 13 While I was lying on my bed, I saw a vision. In the vision I saw a holy angel coming down from heaven.
\v 14 The angel shouted, ‘Cut down the tree, and cut off its branches. Strip\f + \ft Or: Shake \f* off all of its leaves, and scatter its
fruit. Chase away the animals that are lying in the shade of the tree, and the birds that are in its branches.
\v 15 But leave the stump of the tree and its roots in the ground. Fasten a band of iron and bronze around the stump, and allow
it to stay there with grass around it.’ 
\pi
\v 16  \add That tree seems to have represented a man, because the angel also
said\add*, ‘Cause that man to live \add out in the fields\add* among the animals and plants. Cause the dew from the sky to make
his body damp \add each morning\add*. Do not allow him to \add continue
to\add* have a mind like humans; instead, cause him to have a mind like animals have, for seven years.’
\pi
\v 17 The holy angels have decided what must happen. They want to inform everyone that the Supreme God rules over all the
kingdoms in this world. He is the one who chooses who will rule these kingdoms. He
\add sometimes\add* allows very unimportant people to become rulers.
\pi
\v 18 Belteshazzar, that is what I, King Nebuchadnezzar, saw in my dream. Now tell me what the dream means. No one else can
tell me. \add I asked\add* all the very wise men in my kingdom to tell me what It means, but they were unable to do that. But
you can tell me, because the spirit of the holy gods is in you.”
\s Daniel explained the dream 
\pi
\v 19 After I, whose new name was Belteshazzar, did not say anything for some time, because I was very worried\f + \ft Or: disturbed \f* about
the meaning of the dream. Finally, the king said to me, “Belteshazzar, do not be afraid about the dream and about what it
means.” I replied, “Sir, I wish that the events that were predicted in your dream would happen to your enemies, and not to you.
\pi
\v 20  \add In your dream\f + \ft Or: vision \f*\add* you saw a very strong and very tall tree. It seemed to reach to the sky, with the result
that everyone in the world could see it. 
\v 21 It had beautiful leaves and it had produced a lot of fruit for people to eat. Wild animals rested in the shade of that
tree, and birds built nests in its branches. 
\v 22 Your majesty\f + \ft Or: O King \f*, that tree \add represents\add* you! You have become very powerful.
\add It is as though\add* your greatness reaches up to the sky, and you rule people all over the world.
\pi
\v 23 But you saw a holy angel coming down from heaven. That angel said, ‘Cut down the tree, and cut off its branches.
Strip\f + \ft Or: Shake \f* off all of its leaves, and scatter its fruit. But leave the stump of the tree and its roots in the ground. Fasten a
band of iron and bronze around the stump and allow it to stay there with grass around it. Cause the dew from the sky to make
this man damp \add each morning\add*. Cause him to live in the fields with the animals for seven years.’
\pi
\v 24 Your Majesty\f + \ft Or: O King \f*, this is what your dream means. This is what the Supreme God has declared will happen to you.
\v 25  \add Your advisors\add* will force you to live away from other people. You will live in the fields with the wild
animals. You will eat grass like cows do, and dew from the sky will cause your body to be damp\f + \ft Or: wet \f*
\add every morning\add*. You will live that way for seven years, until you learn that it is the Supreme God who rules over the
kingdoms of the world, and he appoints the ones whom he chooses \add to rule
them\add*. 
\v 26 But the stump of the tree and its roots were left in the ground. That means that you will rule your kingdom again when
you learn that it is God \f + \ft metonymy \f* who is really the ruler. 
\v 27 Your Majesty\f + \ft Or: O King \f*, please do what I am telling you to do. Stop sinning, and do what is right. Turn away from your
evil behavior. Act mercifully to poor people. If you do that, perhaps you will continue to be sucessful.”
\s The dream was fulfilled 
\pi
\v 28 But \add the king refused to do\add* these things. So they did happen to him.
\v 29 Twelve months later, \add one day\add* he was walking \add on the flat
roof\add* of his palace in Babylon. 
\v 30 As he looked out over\f + \ft Or: across \f* the city, he said \add to those around
him\add*, “I have built this great city of Babylon to be the place where I rule! I have built it with my own power, in order
\add to show people\add* my glory, to show them that I am very great!”
\pi
\v 31 While he was still saying this, God \f + \ft metonymy \f* spoke from heaven and said, “King Nebuchadnezzar, this is what I am saying must
happen: you are no longer the ruler of this kingdom! 
\v 32 Your advisors will force you to live away from other people. You will live in the fields with wild animals, and you will
eat grass like cows do. You will live that way for seven years, until you learn that it is I, the Supreme God, who rules over
the kingdoms of this world, and I appoint the ones whom I have chosen to rule them.”
\pi
\v 33 Immediately what God predicted happened. Nebuchadnezzar \add could not think like normal people
think\add*, and his advisors forced him to live away from other people. He ate grass like cows do, and dew from the sky caused
his body to be damp\f + \ft Or: wet \f* \add every morning\add*. He lived like that until his hair was as long as eagles' feathers, and his
fingernails became like birds' claws. 
\b
\pi
\v 34 After those seven years ended, I, Nebuchadnezzar, looked up toward heaven,
\add and I acknowledged that what God said was true\add*. Then I could think correctly again. I praised and worshiped the
Supreme God, and I honored him, the one who lives forever. 
\b
\q He rules forever; 
\q2 his kingdom will never end. 
\q
\v 35 All the people in the world are very insignificant; 
\q2 we are not like him. 
\q He has the power to do whatever he wants to do, 
\q2 among the angels in heaven and among us people who live on the earth.
\q So no one can stop him \f + \ft synecdoche \f*, 
\q2 and no one can challenge him, 
\q2 saying to him, “Why \add are you doing these things\add*?” 
\b
\pi
\v 36 When I was able to think correctly again, I was honored again, and I was able to rule my glorious\f + \ft Or: great \f* kingdom again. My
advisors came to me again \add to talk about what should be done\add*, and I became greater and more powerful than I was
before. 
\v 37 Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and honor \f + \ft doublet \f* God, the king who rules in heaven. All of his actions are just and right.
And he is able to cause to become humble those who are proud, \add like I
was\add*.
