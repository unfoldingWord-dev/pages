\c 8  
\s Daniel's vision of a ram and a goat 
\p
\v 1 During the third year that Belshazzar was the king \add of Babylonia\add*, I had another vision
\v 2 In that vision I was in Susa, the capital city of Elam Province. I was standing alongside the Ulai Canal.
\v 3 I looked up and saw a ram that was standing alongside the canal. It had two long horns, but the one that grew last was
longer than the one that grew first. 
\v 4 The ram butted\f + \ft Or: knocked \f* away \add with its horns\add* everything that was west and everything that was north and everything
that was south of it. There were no other animals that were able to oppose it, and none that could rescue\f + \ft Or: save \f* other animals
from its power. The ram did whatever it wanted to do and became very powerful.
\p
\v 5 While I thinking \add about what I had seen\add*, I saw a goat come from the west. It ran across the land very quickly,
\add with the result that it seemed that\add* its feet did not touch the ground. This goat had one very large horn between its
eyes. 
\v 6 It was very angry, and it ran straight toward the ram that I had seen previously, the ram that was standing alongside the
canal. 
\v 7 The goat struck the ram furiously and broke off its two horns, with the result that the ram had no power
\add to defend itself\add*. So the goat knocked the ram down and trampled on it. No one could rescue the ram from the goat's
power. 
\v 8 The goat became very powerful. But when its power was very great, its horn was broken off. But four other large horns took
its place. They each pointed in a different direction. 
\p
\v 9 Then from one of those large horns appeared a little horn, which became very big, and pointed toward the south and then
toward the east and then toward the beautiful \add land of Israel\add*.
\v 10  \add The man who was represented by\add* that horn became very strong, with the result that he attacked some of the
\add soldiers of the\add* army of heaven, and \f + \ft Or: meaning \f* the stars in the sky
\add which represented God's people\add*. He threw some of them to the ground and trampled on them.
\v 11 He defied\f + \ft Or: considered himself to be greater than \f* the leader of the army of heaven, and prevented priests from offering
sacrifices to him. He also defiled the temple\f + \ft Or: caused the temple to become unholy \f*.
\v 12 Then God's people allowed the \add man who was represented
by\add* that horn to control\f + \ft Or: rule \f* them, with the result that they sinned by offering sacrifices to him. And he threw to the
ground the \add laws that contained the\add* true religion. Everything that he did was successful.
\p
\v 13 Then I heard two angels who were talking to each other. One of them asked, “How long will the things\f + \ft Or: events \f* that were in
this vision continue? How long will the man who rebels against God and causes
\add the temple\add* to be defiled be able to prevent priests from offering sacrifices? How long will he trample on the temple
and on the armies of heaven?” 
\p
\v 14 The other angel replied, “It will continue for 1150 days. During each of those days,
\add people will not be permitted to offer sacrifices\add* in the morning or in the evening. After that, the temple will be
purified.” 
\s Gabriel explained the vision 
\p
\v 15 While I, Daniel, was trying to understand what the vision meant, suddenly
\add an angel\add* who resembled a man stood\f + \ft Or: appeared \f* in front of me.
\v 16 And I heard a man call out from the \add other side of\add* the Ulai Canal, saying, “Gabriel, explain to him the meaning
of the vision that he saw!” 
\p
\v 17 So Gabriel came and stood beside me. I was very terrified, with the result that I fell onto the ground. But he said to
me, “Man, it is necessary for you to understand that \add the events that you saw
in\add* the vision will occur \add near\add* the time that \add the
world\add* will end.” 
\p
\v 18 While he was speaking, I fainted. I lay there, unconscious, with my face still on the ground. But Gabriel put his hand on
me and lifted me up in order that I could stand again. 
\p
\v 19 Then he said, “I \add have come here to\add* tell you what will happen because of
\add God\add* being angry. These things will happen near the time when
\add the world\add* will end. 
\v 20 As for the ram with two horns that you saw, those horns \add represent\add* the kingdoms of Media and Persia.
\v 21 The goat \add that you saw represents\add* the kingdom of Greece, and the horn that appeared between its eyes
\add represents\add* its first king. 
\v 22 As for the four horns that grew after the first horn was broken off, they
\add represent\add* four kingdoms into which that first kingdom will be divided
\add after the first king dies\add*. Those four kingdoms will not be as strong\f + \ft Or: powerful \f* as the first kingdom was.
\p
\v 23 The people in those kingdoms will become very wicked, with the result that it will be necessary for them to be punished.
But near the time when those kingdoms will end, one of those kingdoms will have a king who will be very proud\f + \ft Or: defiant \f* [IDI]. He
will also be very fierce and very deceitful. 
\v 24 He will become very powerful, but it will not be because of what he himself does. He will terribly destroy things in many
places, and he will succeed in doing everything that he wants to. He will get rid of many powerful men, and also some of God's
people. 
\v 25 Because he is very cunning\f + \ft Or: clever \f*, he will succeed by doing things that deceive many people. He will be proud of himself.
He will get rid of many people when they think that they are safe. He will also rebel against
\add God\add* \f + \ft euphemism \f*, who is the greatest king. But \add God\add* will destroy him, without the help \f + \ft metonymy \f* of any human being.
\p
\v 26 What you saw in the vision about \add priests being prevented from
making\add* sacrifices in the morning and in the evening, which I explained to you, will surely happen. But
\add for the present time\add*, do not reveal the vision \add to
others\add*, because it will be many years before those things happen.”
\p
\v 27 Then I, Daniel, became weak, and I was sick for several days. Then I arose and returned to doing the work that the king
had given to me, but I was perplexed\f + \ft Or: confused \f* about the vision, and I could not understand it.
