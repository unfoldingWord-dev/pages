\s Daniel's vision at the Tigris River 
\p
\v 1 During the third year that Cyrus was the king of Persia, I Daniel,
\add to whom the king had given the\add* name Belteshazzar, received
\add another\add* message \add from God\add*. The message was true, but it was very difficult for me to understand it. But
\add later\add* I understood the message because of the vision that I had seen.
\p
\v 2 At that time I had been sad for three weeks \add about what had happened to
Jerusalem\add*. 
\v 3 I did not eat any tasty food or any meat or drink any wine. I did not even put any perfumed oil on
\add my face or hair\add* for those three weeks. 
\p
\v 4  \add When those three weeks ended\add*, on April 23, \add my companions
and\add* I were standing on the bank of the great Tigris River. 
\v 5 I looked up and saw someone there who was wearing fine white\f + \ft Or: linen \f* clothes and a belt
\add made of\add* pure gold. 
\v 6 His body \add shone\add* like a precious beryl stone. His face was
\add as bright as\add* a flash of lightning. His eyes were\f + \ft Or: shone \f* like flaming torches. His arms and legs
\add shone\add* like polished bronze. And his voice was \add very
loud\add*, like the roar of a huge crowd. 
\p
\v 7 I, Daniel, was the only one who saw this vision. The men who were with me did not see anything, but
\add they sensed that someone was there, and they\add* became terrified. They ran away and hid themselves.
\v 8 So I was left there by myself, looking at this very unusual vision. I had no strength left. My face became very pale, with
the result that no one would have recognized me. 
\v 9 I saw a man there, and when I heard him speak, I fell to the ground. I ◄fainted\f + \ft Or: became \f* unconscious►,
\add and I lay there\add* with my face on the ground. 
\p
\v 10 Suddenly someone's hand took hold of me and lifted me, with the result that I was on my hands and knees,
\add but I was still\add* trembling. 
\v 11 The man said to me, “Daniel, God loves you very much. Stand up and listen to what I am going to say to you, because
\add God\add* sent me to you.” When he said that, I stood up, but I was still trembling.
\p
\v 12 Then he said to me, “Daniel, do not be afraid. God has heard what you have prayed ever since the first day that you
determined to humble yourself in order to understand \add the vision\add*. I have come to you because of what you prayed.
\v 13 The \add evil spirit who\add* rules the kingdom of Persia resisted\f + \ft Or: hindered \f* me for 21 days, but Michael, who is one of
God's chief angels, came to help me. I left him there in Persia \add to
resist\add* that evil spirit who rules there. 
\v 14 I have come here to enable you to understand what will happen to the Israeli people in the future.
\add Do not forget that\add* the vision \add that you saw\add* is about
\add things that will happen in\add* the future, \add not about things that will happen very
soon\add*.” 
\p
\v 15 While he was saying that, I stared at the ground and was unable to say anything
\add because I was very afraid\add*. 
\v 16 Suddenly \add the angel\add*, who resembled a human, touched my lips. Then
\add I was able to speak, and\add* I said to him, “Sir, because \add I have
seen\add* this vision, I have become very weak, with the result that I cannot stop trembling.
\v 17 I am not able \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* to talk to you, my master. I have no strength left, and it is very difficult for me to breathe.”
\p
\v 18 But he took hold of me again, and enabled me to become stronger again.
\v 19 He said to me, “Man, God loves you very much. So do not be afraid. I desire\f + \ft Or: want \f* that things will go well for you and
that you will be encouraged.” When he had said that, I felt even stronger, and I said, “Sir, tell me what you want to tell me.
You have enabled me to feel stronger.” 
\p
\v 20-21 Then he said, “◄Do you know why I came to you?\f + \ft Or: I \f* will tell you why I came to you.► \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* It is to reveal to you what
is written in the book which reveals\f + \ft Or: contains \f* God's truth. But now I must return to fight against the evil spirit who rules the
kingdom of Persia. After I have defeated him, the evil angel who guards Greece will appear
\add and I must defeat him\add*. Michael, who guards you \add Israeli
people\add*, will help me, but there is no one else to help me.”
