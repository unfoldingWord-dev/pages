\c 11  
\s Acts 11:1-3 
\s Some Jewish believers criticized Peter. 
\p
\v 1 The apostles and \add other\add* believers who lived in various towns in Judea
\add province\add* heard people say that \add some\add* non-Jewish people had believed the message
\add from\add* God \add about Jesus\add*. 
\v 2 So when Peter \add and the six other believers\add* returned
\add from Caesarea\add* to Jerusalem, \add some\add* Jewish believers criticized Peter,
\add because they thought that Jews should not associate with non-Jews\add* [MTY].
\v 3 They said to him, “Not only was it wrong for you(sg) to visit non-Jewish people, you
\add even\add* ate with them!” 
\s Acts 11:4-10 
\s Peter told about his vision. 
\p
\v 4 So Peter began to explain exactly \add what had happened concerning
Cornelius\add*. 
\v 5 He said, “I was praying \add by myself\add* in Joppa \add town\add* and in a trance I saw a vision. I saw that something
like a large sheet was being lowered from heaven. \add It was tied with
ropes\add* at its four corners, and it came down to where I was.
\v 6 As I was looking intently into it, I saw some tame animals \add but also animals that our laws forbid us to eat,
including\add* wild animals, snakes, and wild birds. 
\v 7 Then I heard God [MTY] commanding me, ‘Peter, rise up, kill
\add some of these\add*, and \add cook and\add* eat \add their meat\add*!’
\v 8 But I replied, ‘Lord, \add you(sg)\add* surely do not \add really want me to do
that\add*, because I have never eaten [MTY] meat \add from any animal\add* that
\add our laws say\add* that we\add (exc)\add* must not eat [SYN]!’
\v 9 God spoke from heaven \add to me\add* a second time, ‘\add I
am\add* God, \add so\add* if I have made something acceptable \add to
eat\add*, do not say that it is not acceptable \add to eat\add*!’
\v 10 Then \add after that happened three times, the sheet with\add* all
\add those animals and birds\add* was pulled up into heaven again.”
\s Acts 11:11-17 
\s Peter said that the Holy Spirit came to be with the non-Jewish believers. Peter accepted those non-Jews as fellow believers.
\p
\v 11 “At that exact moment, three men who had been {whom \add Cornelius\add* had} sent from Caesarea arrived at the house
where I was staying. 
\v 12  \add God's\add* Spirit told me that I should be willing to go with them
\add even though they were not Jews\add*. These six \add Jewish\add* believers
\add from Joppa\add* went with me \add to Caesarea\add*, and then
we\add (exc)\add* went into that \add non-Jewish\add* man's house.
\v 13 He told us that he had seen an angel standing in his house. The angel told him, ‘Tell some
\add men\add* to go to Joppa and bring back Simon whose other name is Peter.
\v 14 He will tell you\add (sg)\add* how you and everyone [MTY] else in your house will be saved {how
\add God\add* will save you and everyone [MTY] else in your house}.’
\v 15 After I started to speak, the Holy Spirit \add suddenly\add* came down on them, just like he had first [MTY] come on us
\add during the Pentecost festival\add*. 
\v 16 Then I remembered what the Lord had said: ‘John caused people to be baptized in water, but
\add God\add* will cause the Holy Spirit \add to enter you and change your
lives.’\add* 
\v 17 God gave those non-Jews the same Holy Spirit that he had given to
us\add (inc)\add* after we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ. So,
◄\add I\add* could not \add possibly\add* tell God that he did wrong\add when he gave them the Holy
Spirit!\add*/how could I \add tell\add* God that he did wrong\add when he gave them the Holy
Spirit\add*?► [RHQ] \add He was showing that he had received them!\add*”
\s Acts 11:18 
\s They praised God that he also saves non-Jewish people. 
\p
\v 18 After \add those Jewish believers\add* heard what Peter said, they stopped criticizing
\add him. Instead\add*, they praised God, saying, “Then it is \add clear to us
that\add* God has also accepted the non-Jews so that they will have eternal life, if they turn from their sinful behavior
\add and believe in Jesus\add*.” 
\s Acts 11:19-21 
\s Many non-Jews in Antioch believed in the Lord Jesus. 
\p
\v 19 After \add people had killed\add* Stephen, many of the believers left
\add Jerusalem and went\add* to other places because people were causing them to suffer
\add there in Jerusalem. Some of\add* them went to Phoenicia \add region\add*, some went to
Cyprus\add Island\add*, and others went to Antioch \add city in Syria province. In those
places\add* they were continually telling people the message \add about
Jesus\add*, but they told only other Jewish people. 
\v 20 Some of the believers were men from Cyprus \add Island\add* and Cyrene
\add city in north Africa\add*. They went to Antioch \add city\add*,
and\add although they told other Jews about\add* the Lord Jesus, they also told non-Jewish people
\add there\add*. 
\v 21 The Lord \add God\add* [MTY] was powerfully enabling those
\add believers to preach effectively. As a result\add*, very many
\add non-Jewish\add* people believed \add their message and\add* trusted in the Lord
\add Jesus\add*. 
\s Acts 11:22-24 
\s Barnabas encouraged the believers at Antioch. 
\p
\v 22 The group of believers in Jerusalem heard [MTY] \add people say that many people in Antioch were believing in Jesus.
So\add* the \add leaders\add* of the congregation in \add Jerusalem\add* asked Barnabas to go to Antioch.
\v 23 When he got \add there\add*, he realized that God had acted kindly toward
\add the believers. So\add* he was very happy, and he continually encouraged all of the
\add believers\add* to continue to trust completely in the Lord \add Jesus\add*.
\v 24 Barnabas was a good man \add whom\add* the Holy Spirit completely controlled, one who trusted
\add God\add* completely. \add Because of what Barnabas did\add*, many people
\add there\add* believed in the Lord \add Jesus\add*. 
\s Acts 11:25-26 
\s Barnabas and Saul taught many believers at Antioch. 
\p
\v 25 Then Barnabas went to Tarsus \add city in Cilicia province to
try\add* to find Saul. 
\v 26 After he found him, Barnabas brought him \add back to\add* Antioch
\add to help teach the believers. So during\add* a whole year \add Barnabas and
Saul\add* met \add regularly\add* with the congregation \add there\add* and taught many of them
\add about Jesus. It was\add* at Antioch that the believers were first called Christians
{\add that people\add* first called the believers Christians}. 
\s Acts 11:27-30 
\s Believers in Antioch helped needy believers in Judea. 
\p
\v 27 During the time \add that Barnabas and Saul were\add* at Antioch, some
\add believers who were\add* prophets arrived there from Jerusalem.
\v 28 One of them, whose name was Agabus, stood up \add in order to
speak\add*. \add God's\add* Spirit enabled him to prophesy ◄that there would soon be a famine in many countries/that
\add people\add* in many countries [HYP] would soon \add suffer because
they\add* would not have enough \add food\add* to eat►. (That famine happened when Claudius was the
\add Roman Emperor\add*.) 
\v 29 When the believers \add there heard what Agabus said\add*, they decided that they would send
\add money\add* to help the believers who lived in Judea \add province\add*. Each
\add of them decided to give as much money\add* as he was able \add to
give\add*. 
\v 30 They sent \add the money\add* with Barnabas and Saul to the leaders of the congregation
\add in Jerusalem\add*.
