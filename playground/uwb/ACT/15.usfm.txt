\s Acts 15:1-2 
\s Some Jewish believers said that God will save only people who are circumcised.
\p
\v 1  \add Then\add* some \add Jewish\add* believers went down from Judea
\add province\add* to Antioch. They started teaching the \add non-Jewish\add* believers
\add there, and said\add*, “\add You\add* ◄\add must\add* be circumcised/must have God's mark put on you►
\add to indicate you belong to God\add*, as Moses \add commanded\add* in the laws that
\add he received from God\add*. If you do not do that, you will not be saved
{\add God\add* will not save you}.” 
\v 2 Paul and Barnabas strongly disagreed with those Jews and started arguing
\add with them. So the believers at Antioch\add* appointed Paul and Barnabas and some of the other believers to go to
Jerusalem, in order that they would/could discuss this matter with the apostles and
\add other spiritual\add* leaders. 
\s Acts 15:3-4 
\s Paul and Barnabas reported what God had enabled them to do. 
\p
\v 3 After Paul, Barnabas, and the others were given things for their trip by the congregation
\add at Antioch\add* {After the congregation \add at Antioch\add* gave Paul, Barnabas, and the others things for their trip},
they traveled through Phoenicia and Samaria \add provinces. When they stopped at different places in those
provinces\add*, they reported \add to the believers\add* that \add many\add* non-Jews
\add in Antioch\add* had become believers. As a result, all the believers
\add in those places\add* rejoiced greatly. 
\v 4 And when Paul, Barnabas, and the others arrived in Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the apostles, the
\add other\add* elders, and the \add other members of the\add* congregation
\add there\add* {the apostles, the \add other\add* elders, and the
\add other members of the\add* congregation \add there\add* welcomed them}. Then Paul and Barnabas reported the things that God
had enabled them to do \add among non-Jewish people\add*. 
\s Acts 15:5 
\s Some Jewish believers said that non-Jewish believers must obey Moses' laws.
\p
\v 5 But some of the \add Jewish\add* believers who belonged to the Pharisee sect stood up
\add among the other believers and\add* said to them, “The non-Jews
\add who have believed in Jesus\add* must be circumcised, and they must be told to obey the laws
\add that God gave to\add* Moses.” 
\s Acts 15:6-11 
\s Peter told about non-Jews becoming believers when he preached to them.
\p
\v 6 Then the apostles and \add the other\add* elders met together in order to talk about this matter.
\v 7 After they had discussed it for a long time, Peter stood up and spoke to them. He said, “Fellow believers, you
\add all\add* know that a long time ago God chose me from among you
\add other apostles, in order that\add* the non-Jewish people might
\add also\add* hear me [SYN] tell \add them\add* the good message
\add about the Lord Jesus\add*, so that they could hear \add it\add* and believe
\add in him. So Paul and Barnabas are not the first ones to tell non-Jews about
Jesus\add*. 
\v 8 God knows \add and judges\add* people according to what they think,
\add not according to who their ancestors were\add*. By sending the Holy Spirit to
\add the non-Jews\add*, just like \add he had\add* also done for
us\add (inc)\add* Jews, he showed \add me and others\add* that he had accepted them
\add to be his people\add*. 
\v 9  \add God\add* saved us \add Jews\add* and those \add non-Jews\add* similarly, making them clean inside simply as a result
of their believing \add in the Lord Jesus. That was exactly how he has forgiven
us\add*. 
\v 10  \add You are wanting to force the non-Jewish believers to obey our Jewish rituals and
laws\add*—laws that God has shown that he does not require them to obey [MET].
\add Your doing that is like\add* putting a heavy burden on their necks! So then, ◄stop making God angry by doing that!/why are
you making God angry by doing that?► [RHQ] Our ancestors and we\add (inc)
Jews\add* have never been able to bear \add the burden of obeying those
laws!\add* 
\v 11 But we\add (inc) know that it is not because\add* we\add (inc) try to obey those laws that God saves us(inc) Jews. On the
contrary\add*, we\add (inc)\add* know that it is because of what the Lord Jesus did for
us\add (inc)\add* that we did not deserve that we\add (inc)\add* are saved {that
\add God\add* saves us} \add from the guilt of our sins. God saves us
Jews\add* exactly like \add he saves\add* those \add non-Jews who believe in the Lord
Jesus\add*.” 
\s Acts 15:12 
\s Barnabas and Paul reported what God had helped them to do among the non-Jews.
\p
\v 12 All the people \add there\add* became silent \add after Peter had
spoken\add*. Then they \add all\add* listened to Barnabas and Paul,
\add as the two of\add* them told about the many great miracles that God had enabled them to do among the non-Jewish people,
\add miracles that showed that God had accepted the non-Jews\add*.
\s Acts 15:13-21 
\s James recommended what they should tell the non-Jewish believers.
\p
\v 13 When Barnabas and Paul had finished speaking, James, \add the leader of the group of believers there in
Jerusalem\add*, spoke to them. \add He said\add*, “Fellow believers, listen to me.
\v 14 Simon \add Peter\add* has told you how God previously blessed the non-Jews. God did that by choosing from among them a
people who would belong to him [MTY]. 
\v 15  \add These\add* words that \add God spoke\add*, words that were written by
\add one of\add* the prophets {that one of the prophets wrote} \add long
ago\add*, agree with that, 
\q
\v 16 Later on I will return and I will re-establish the kingdom [MET] that David
\add ruled\add* and that has been {that \add people\add* have} destroyed. My
\add doing that will be like\add* rebuilding\add a house\add* that has been {that
\add people\add* have} torn down. 
\v 17 I will do that in order that all other people might seek\add me\add*, the Lord
\add God. I will do that in order that\add* all the non-Jews whom I have called
\add to belong\add* to me [MTY] might seek me. \add You can be certain that this will happen because
I\add* the Lord\add God\add*, who will do those things, have spoken\add these
words\add*. 
\v 18 I \add caused my people to know about them\add* long ago.”
\p
\v 19  \add James continued by saying\add*, “Therefore I have decided
\add that we(inc)\add* should stop bothering the non-Jewish people who are turning
\add away from their sins and turning\add* to God. \add That is, we should stop demanding that they
obey\add* all \add our laws\add* and rituals. 
\v 20 Instead, we should write \add a letter\add* to them, \add one requiring only four things: They
should\add* not eat \add meat/food that people\add* have offered to idols, they should not have sex with someone to whom they
are not married, they should not \add eat meat from animals that have been killed
by\add* being strangled {\add people have strangled\add*}, and \add they should not
eat\add* the blood \add of animals\add*. 
\v 21 In many cities, for a very long time people have been proclaiming
\add the laws that\add* Moses \add wrote\add* [MTY], \add laws prohibiting those
things\add*. And every ◄Sabbath/Jewish day of rest► \add those laws\add* are read {someone reads
\add those laws\add*} in the Jewish meeting places. \add So if the non-Jews want to know more about those laws, they can find
out in our meeting houses\add*.” 
\s Acts 15:22-29 
\s The church leaders sent messengers with a letter to non-Jewish believers.
\p
\v 22 The apostles and the \add other\add* elders, along with all the
\add other\add* members of the congregation, accepted \add what James had
said\add*. Then they decided that they should choose men from among themselves and that they should send them, along with Paul
and Barnabas, to Antioch, to \add let the believers there know what the
leaders\add* at Jerusalem had decided. So they chose Judas, who was also called Barsabbas, and Silas, who were leaders among
the believers \add at Jerusalem\add*. 
\v 23 Then they wrote the following letter \add that they asked Judas and Silas to take to the believers at
Antioch\add*: “\add We(exc)\add* apostles and \add other\add* leaders who are your fellow believers
\add send our greetings to you as we write this to you\add* non-Jewish believers
\add who live\add* in Antioch and \add other places in\add* Syria and Cilicia
\add provinces\add*. 
\v 24 People have told us that some men from among us went \add to
you\add*, although we had not told \add them to do that\add*. They troubled/distressed you [SYN]
\add by telling you things\add* that confused your thinking. 
\v 25 So \add while we(exc) met together here\add*, we decided to choose some men and ask them to go to you, along with
Barnabas and Paul, whom we\add (exc)\add* love very much. 
\v 26 Those two have put their lives in danger because of their \add serving\add* our Lord [MTY] Jesus Christ.
\v 27 We\add (exc) have also chosen\add* Judas and Silas to go to you. They will tell you the same things
\add that we are writing\add*. 
\v 28 The Holy Spirit and \add also\add* we decided that you should not be required {that we should not require you} to obey a
lot of burdensome \add Jewish\add* laws. Instead, \add we\add* only
\add require you to obey\add* the following instructions, 
\q
\v 29 You should not eat food that people have sacrificed to idols.
\q You should not eat blood from animals, and you should not eat meat from animals that people have killed by strangling them.
\q Also, you should not have sex with someone to whom you are not married.
\p Those things \add especially offend Jewish believers. So if\add* you avoid doing them, you will be doing what is right. That
is all/Goodbye.” 
\s Acts 15:30-32 
\s The letter and messengers encouraged the believers at Antioch.
\p
\v 30 The \add four\add* men whom \add they\add* had chosen went
\add from Jerusalem\add* down to Antioch \add city. When\add* all the believers
\add there\add* had assembled together, \add Judas and Silas\add* gave the letter to them.
\v 31 When the believers there read the letter, they rejoiced, \add because its
message\add* encouraged them. 
\v 32  \add Just like Paul and Barnabas were\add* ◄\add prophets/men who spoke messages from
God\add*►. Judas and Silas were also prophets. They spoke a lot and encouraged the believers
\add there\add*, and helped them to trust more strongly \add in the Lord
Jesus\add*. 
\s Acts 15:33-35 
\s Paul and Barnabas continued to teach and preach in Antioch. 
\p
\v 33-34 After \add Judas and Silas\add* had stayed there for some time
\add and were ready to return to Jerusalem\add*, the believers \add at
Antioch\add* wished them well, and the believers \add prayed that
God\add* would protect \add them as they traveled. So the two men\add* started to go back to the leaders
\add in Jerusalem\add* who had asked them to go \add to Antioch\add*.\f + 
\fqa just before they left, Silas decided to stay there \fqa in Antioch.” Each translator should choose between this text and
the implied information that we have given in verse 40. Each should choose the way to translate that seems the most
preferable.\f* 
\v 35 However, Paul and Barnabas continued to stay in Antioch. \add While they were
there\add*, they, along with many others, were teaching \add people\add* and preaching to them the message about the Lord
\add Jesus\add*. 
\s Acts 15:36-41 
\s Paul and Barnabas separated, and Paul chose Silas. 
\p
\v 36 After some time Paul said to Barnabas, “Let's go back and visit the fellow believers in every city where we
\add previously\add* proclaimed the message about the Lord \add Jesus. In that way, we will
know\add* how \add well\add* they are continuing \add to believe in the Lord
Jesus\add*.” 
\v 37 Barnabas \add agreed with Paul, and said that he\add* wanted to take John, whose other name was Mark, along with them
\add again\add*. 
\v 38 However, Paul \add told Barnabas that he\add* thought that it would not be good to take Mark
\add with them, because\add* Mark had deserted them when they were previously in Pamphylia
\add region\add*, and had not continued to work with them. 
\v 39 Paul and Barnabas strongly disagreed \add with each other about
that\add*, so they separated from each other. Barnabas took Mark
\add along with him and they got\add* on a ship and went to Cyprus\add Island\add*.
\v 40 Paul chose Silas, \add who had returned to Antioch, to work with
him\add*. The believers \add there\add* asked the Lord \add God\add* to graciously help
\add Paul and Silas. Then\add* the two of them departed \add from
Antioch\add*. 
\v 41 Paul continued traveling \add with Silas\add* through Syria and Cilicia
\add provinces\add*. In those places he was helping the congregations to trust strongly
\add in the Lord Jesus\add*.
