\c 23  
\s After Sarah died, Abraham bought a burial place for her 
\p
\v 1 When Sarah was 127 years old, 
\v 2 she died at Kiriath-Arba, which is now called Hebron \add city\add*, in Canaan land. After Abraham mourned and cried over
her, 
\v 3 he left the body of his wife and spoke to some of the descendants of Heth, saying,
\v 4 “I am a foreigner \f + \fr doublet \f* living among you, \add so I do not own any land
here\add*. Sell me some land here so that I can bury my wife's body.”
\v 5 They replied to him, 
\v 6 “Sir, you are a powerful prince among us. Choose one of our finest tombs and bury your wife's
\add body\add* in it. None of us will refuse to sell land to you for a tomb for your wife's body.”
\v 7 Then Abraham stood up and bowed \add in respect\add* in front of the people who owned the land, the descendants of Heth.
\v 8 He said to them, “If you say that you are willing for me to bury my wife's body here, listen to me, and ask Ephron, the
son of Zohar for me, 
\v 9 so that he will sell to me the cave in the Machpelah area, which is at the end of his field. Ask him to sell it to me for
the full price he wants, so that I can have a burial ground among you.”
\v 10 Ephron was sitting among the people near the city gate where many \f + \fr hyperbole \f* descendants of Heth had gathered. He heard what
Abraham said to them. 
\v 11  \add So, just to make the customary reply to start the real discussion about a
price\add*, Ephron said, “No, sir, listen to me. I will give to you the field and the cave in it, without charge, with the
people here as witnesses.” 
\v 12 Abraham again bowed before the people who lived in the land,
\v 13 and said to Ephron, as all the others were listening, “\add No\add*, listen to me. If you are willing, I will pay for the
field. You tell me what the price is, and I will give it to you. If you accept it, the field will become mine, and I can bury
my wife's body there.” 
\v 14 Ephron answered Abraham, saying to him, 
\v 15 “Sir, listen to me. The land is worth 400 pieces of silver. But the price is not important to you and me. Give me the
money and bury your wife's body there.” 
\v 16 Abraham agreed with Ephron about the price, and weighed for Ephron the 400 pieces of silver he had suggested, as everyone
was listening, using the standard weights for silver used by people who sold things.
\p
\v 17 So Ephron's field in the Machpelah area, near Mamre, and the cave in the field, and all the trees that were in the field
inside the boundaries of the land, became Abraham's possession. 
\v 18 It became Abraham's property as all the descendants of Heth were listening there at the city gate.
\v 19 After that, Abraham buried his wife Sarah's body in the cave in the field in the Machpelah area near Mamre, which is now
called Hebron \add city\add*, in Canaan land. 
\v 20 So the field and the cave in it were officially sold to Abraham by the descendants of Heth, to be used as a burial
ground.
