\c 9  
\s God made an agreement with Noah 
\p
\v 1 Then God blessed Noah and his sons, saying to them, “I want you to have many children who will live all over the earth.
\v 2 All the wild animals on the earth and all the birds, all the creatures that move close to the ground, and all the fish,
will be very afraid \f + \fk doublet \f* of you. 
\v 3 Just as I previously said you could eat green plants for food, now I am saying you can eat everything that lives and
moves. 
\v 4 It is blood that causes creatures to be alive, therefore you must not eat meat that still has blood in it after the animal
is killed. After you have drained the blood out, you may eat it.
\v 5 I insist that murderers must be executed. Animals that kill people must also be executed. The reason that everyone who
murders someone else must be executed is that 
\v 6 I made people to be like myself \add in many ways\add*. So someone who murders another human being must be executed by
others, \add because he killed someone who is like me\add*. 
\p
\v 7 As for you, I want you to produce many children, in order that they and their descendants may live all over the earth.”
\p
\v 8 God also said to Noah and his sons, 
\v 9 “Listen carefully. I am now making a solemn promise to you and with your descendants,
\v 10 and with all the living creatures that are with you—including the birds, the livestock, and the wild animals—every living
creature on the earth that came out of the boat with you. 
\v 11 This is the promise that I am making to you: I will never again destroy all living creatures by a flood, or destroy
everything else on the earth by a flood.” 
\v 12 Then God said to him, “This is the sign to guarantee that I will keep the promise that I am making to you and to all
living creatures, a promise that I will keep forever: 
\v 13 From time to time I will put a rainbow in the sky. It will be the sign of my promise to you and everything on the earth.
\v 14 When I cause rain to fall from the clouds, and a rainbow appears in the sky,
\v 15 it will remind me about the promise that I have made to you and all living creatures, my promise that there will never
again be a flood that will destroy all living creatures. 
\v 16 Whenever there is a rainbow in the sky, I will see it, and I will think about the promise that I have made to every
living creature that is upon the earth, a promise that I will keep forever.”
\p
\v 17 Then God said to Noah, “The rainbow will be the sign of the promise that I have made to all the creatures that live on
the earth.” 
\p
\v 18 The sons of Noah who came out of boat were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Ham later became the father of Canaan.
\v 19 All the people on the earth are descended from these three sons of Noah.
\s What happened after Noah got drunk 
\p
\v 20 Noah was a farmer. He planted grapevines. 
\v 21 After they produced grapes, he made wine from them. One day, when he drank too much of the wine, he became drunk, and he
lay naked in his tent. 
\v 22 Ham, the father of Canaan, saw his father lying naked in the tent. So he went outside and told his two older brothers
what he had seen. 
\v 23 Then Shem and Japheth took a large cloth and placed it across their backs, and walked backwards into the tent. They
covered their father's naked body with the cloth. Their faces were turned away from their father, so they did not see him
naked. 
\v 24 When Noah woke up and was sober again, he found out how wrongfully Ham, his youngest son, had behaved toward him.
\v 25 He said, “I am cursing Ham's youngest son, Canaan, and his descendants. They will be like slaves to their uncles.
\v 26 I will ask God to enlarge the territory that belongs to Japheth, and allow his descendants to live peacefully among the
descendants of Shem \f + \fk metonymy \f*. 
\v 27 And I will ask that Canaan's descendants will be like slaves of Japheth's descendants.”
\p
\v 28 Noah lived 350 more years after the flood. 
\v 29 He died when he was 950 years old.
