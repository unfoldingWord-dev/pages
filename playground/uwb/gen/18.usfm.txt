\c 18  
\s Yahweh appeared to them and promised again that they would have a son
\p
\v 1 One day during that year when it was hot, Yahweh appeared to Abraham again near the big trees that belonged to Mamre,
while Abraham was sitting in the entrance to his tent. 
\v 2 Abraham looked up \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* and was surprised to see three men standing near him.
\add Actually, one was Yahweh, and the other two were angels\add*. When he saw them, he ran to meet them. He prostrated himself
with his face on the ground in respect, 
\v 3 and said \add to one of them\add*, “Sir, if you are pleased with me, stay here for a little while \\f + \\ft litotes \\f*.
\v 4 Allow my servants to bring a little water and wash your feet, and rest under this tree.
\v 5 Since you have come here to me, allow me to bring you some food \\f + \\ft synecdoche \\f* so that you can feel refreshed before you leave.”
Yahweh replied, “All right, do as you have said.” 
\v 6 So Abraham quickly went into the tent and said to Sarah, “Quick, get some of our best flour and make some loaves of
bread!” 
\v 7 Then he ran to the herd of cattle and selected a calf whose meat would be tender and tasty. He gave it to one of his
servants who hurried to kill and cook it. 
\v 8 When the meat was cooked, Abraham brought some curds and milk and the meat that had been prepared, and set them in front
of them. Then he stood near them, under a tree, while they ate. 
\v 9 They asked him, “Where is Sarah, your wife?” He replied, “She is in the tent.”
\v 10 Then the leader of the group said, “I will return to you ◄about this time\f + \ft Or: in \f* the springtime► next year, and to your
amazement, your wife Sarah will have an infant son.” It happened that Sarah was listening at the entrance of the tent, which
was behind the one who was speaking. 
\v 11 Abraham and Sarah were very old, and Sarah was far past the time of ◄menopause\f + \ft Or: when \f* she could bear children►.
\v 12 So Sarah laughed to herself, thinking, “My body is worn out, and my husband is old. So how can I have the pleasure of
having a baby?” \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* 
\v 13 Yahweh said to Abraham, “Why did Sarah laugh? Why was she thinking, ‘I am too old, so how can I hear a child?’
\v 14 I am Yahweh! ◄Is there anything too difficult for me?\f + \ft Or: There \f* is nothing too difficult for me!► \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* I will return about
this time next year in the springtime, and Sarah will have an infant son.”
\v 15 Then Sarah was afraid, so she lied and said, “I did not laugh.” But Yahweh said, “Don't deny it! You did laugh.”
\s Abraham tried to intercede for the wicked people of Sodom 
\p
\v 16 When the three men got up to leave, they looked down into the valley toward Sodom
\add city\add*. Abraham was walking with them to say “Farewell” to them.
\v 17 Yahweh said to himself, “It is not right for me to prevent Abraham from knowing what I plan to do \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f*.
\v 18 Abraham's descendants \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* will become a great and powerful nation. And people of \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* all nations will be blessed
because of what I do for him. 
\v 19 I have chosen him in order that he will direct his children and their families so that they will obey me and do what is
right and fair, so that I can do for Abraham what I promised.” 
\v 20 So Yahweh said to Abraham, “I have heard the terrible things that have been said about the people of \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* Sodom and
Gomorrah. Their sins are very great. 
\v 21 So I will go down now, and I will see if all the terrible things that I have heard are true or not true.”
\v 22 Then the two men turned and started walking toward Sodom. But Yahweh remained, standing in front of Abraham.
\v 23 Abraham came closer to him and said, “Will you really destroy righteous people along with wicked ones?
\v 24 What will you do if there are 50 righteous people in the city? Will you really get rid of them all, and not spare the
place\f + \ft Or: city \f* for the sake of the 50 righteous people who are in the city?
\v 25 It would certainly not be right for you to do such a thing, to kill righteous people along with wicked ones, and treat
righteous people and wicked people the same way. You could not do that, because you, who are the judge of everyone on the
earth, will certainly do what is right \add regarding the people of
Sodom\add*!” \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* 
\v 26 Yahweh replied, “If I find 50 righteous people in Sodom, I will spare the whole place\f + \ft Or: city \f* for their sake.”
\v 27 Abraham replied, “I should not be bold like this and speak to you, God, because I am as worthless as dust and ashes
\\f + \\ft metaphor \\f*. 
\v 28 But what will you do if there are only 45 righteous people? Will you destroy everyone in the whole city because there are
only 45 and not 50 righteous people?” Yahweh replied, “I will not destroy it if I find that there are 45 righteous people.”
\v 29 Abraham continued to speak to him like this, saying, “What will you do if you find that there are only 40 there?” Yahweh
replied, “I will not destroy them all, for the sake of the 40”. 
\v 30 Abraham said, “God, please don't be angry now. Let me speak again. What will you do if there are only 30 righteous
people?” He replied, “I will not do it if I find that there are 30 there.”
\v 31 Abraham said, “I should not be bold and speak to you like this, God. But what will you do if you find that there are only
20 there?” He replied, “I will not destroy the whole city, for the sake of those 20.”
\v 32 Abraham said, “God, don't be angry now. Just let me speak one time more. What will you do if you find that there are only
ten righteous people there?” Yahweh answered, “I will not destroy the city for the sake of those ten.”
\v 33 Abraham said no more, and as soon as Yahweh finished speaking with Abraham, he left, and Abraham returned home.
