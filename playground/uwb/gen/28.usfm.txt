\c 28  
\s Isaac gave instructions to Jacob 
\p
\v 1 Then Isaac summoned Jacob, and gave him a blessing. He told him this: “Do not marry a woman from the women of the Canaan
people-group. 
\v 2 Instead, go right away to Paddan-Aram\f + \ft Or: Mesopotamia \f*, to the house of your mother's father Bethuel. Ask one of the daughters
of your mother's brother Laban to marry you. 
\v 3 I will pray that God Almighty will bless you, and enable you to have many descendants, in order that they will become many
people-groups. 
\v 4 I also will pray that he will bless you and your descendants by enabling you to possess\f + \ft Or: seize \f* the land in which you are
now living as a foreigner, the land that God promised to give to Abraham and his descendants.”
\v 5 So Isaac sent Jacob to Paddan-Aram, to live with Rebekah's brother Laban, the son of Bethuel, who belonged to the Aram
people-group. 
\s Esau married Ishmael's daughter 
\p
\v 6 Esau found out that his father Isaac had blessed Jacob and then sent him to Paddan-Aram. He also found out that when he
blessed Isaac, he told him, “Do not marry a woman of the Canaan people-group,”
\v 7 and that Jacob had obeyed his father and mother, and had gone to Paddan-Aram.
\v 8 Esau also realized that his father Isaac did not approve of women from the Canaan people-group.
\v 9 Because of that, Esau went to see his cousin Ishmael, and married Mahalath, the daughter of Ishmael. Mahalath was the
sister of Nabaioth and the granddaughter of Abraham. 
\s God made a promise to Jacob in a dream 
\p
\v 10 Meanwhile, Jacob left Beersheba and started walking along the road to Haran.
\v 11 When he arrived at a certain place, he stopped there, because the sun had gone down. He took one of the stones there and
put it under his head to use as a pillow. Then he lay down and slept there.
\v 12 While he was sleeping, he had a dream, in which he was surprised to see a stairway. The bottom of the stairway was on the
earth and the top was in the sky. Jacob also saw that God's angels were going up and down the stairway.
\v 13 And he was surprised to see Yahweh standing at the top of the stairway, saying “I am Yahweh God, whom your grandfather
Abraham worshiped, and whom Isaac worships. I will give to you and to your descendants the land on which you are lying.
\v 14 Your descendants will be as numerous as the particles of dust\f + \ft Or: dirt \f* that are on the earth, and their territory will be
very large. It will extend in all directions, to the east and to the west, to the north and to the south. And people of all
people-groups on earth will receive blessings because of \add what happens
to\add* you and to your descendants. 
\v 15 I will help you and protect you wherever you go, and I will bring you back to this land. I will not leave you; I will
continue to do for you all that I have promised to do.” 
\p
\v 16 During the night, when Jacob woke up from sleeping, he thought, “Surely Yahweh is in this place, and until now I was not
aware of it!” 
\v 17 He was afraid, and he said, “This place is very awesome! This is surely the place where God lives, and this is the
entrance to heaven!” 
\v 18 The next morning Jacob got up and took the stone that he had put under his head and set it up on its end to show that the
place was a holy place. He poured some olive oil on top of the stone to dedicate it to God.
\v 19 He named that place Bethel, \add which means 'house of God.'\add* Previously its name was Luz.
\p
\v 20 Jacob solemnly promised God, saying, “God, if you will help me and protect me while I am taking this journey, and if you
give me enough food to eat and clothes to wear, 
\v 21 in order that I can later return safely to my father's house, then you, Yahweh, will be the God that I will worship.
\v 22 This stone that I have set up will mark the place where people can worship you. And I will give back to you a tenth of
everything that you give to me.”
