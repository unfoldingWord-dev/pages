\s Jacob and Esau met peacefully 
\p
\v 1  \add Then Jacob joined the rest of his family\add*. Later that day Jacob looked up and saw Esau coming, and there were
400 men with him. \add Jacob was worried because of that\add*, so he separated the children. He put Leah's children with Leah,
Rachel's children with Rachel, and the two female slaves' children with their mothers.
\v 2 He put the two female slaves and their children in front. He put Leah and her children next. He put Rachel and Joseph at
the rear. 
\v 3 He himself went ahead of them all, and as he continued to approach his older brother, he prostrated himself with his face
on the ground seven times. 
\v 4 But Esau ran to Jacob. He hugged him, put his arms around his neck, and kissed him on the cheek. And they both cried.
\v 5 Then Esau looked up and saw the women and the children. He asked, “Who are these people who are with you?” Jacob replied,
“These are the wives and children that God has graciously/kindly given to me.”
\v 6 Then the female slaves and their children came near and bowed in front of Esau.
\v 7 Then Leah and her children came and bowed down. Finally Joseph and Rachel came near and bowed down.
\p
\v 8 Esau asked, “What is the meaning of all the animals that I saw?” Jacob replied, “I am giving them to you, sir, so that you
will feel good toward me.” 
\v 9 But Esau replied, “My younger brother, I have enough animals! Keep for yourself the animals that you have!”
\v 10 But Jacob said, “No, please, if you feel good toward me, accept these gifts from me. You have greeted me very kindly.
Seeing your smiling face assures me \add that you have forgiven me\add*. It is like seeing the face of God!
\v 11 Please accept these gifts that I have brought to you, because God has acted kindly toward me, and I still have plenty of
animals!” Jacob kept on urging him to accept the animals, and finally he accepted them.
\p
\v 12 Then Esau said, “Let's continue traveling together, and I will show the road to you.”
\v 13 Jacob \add had no intention to go with Esau\add*, but he said, “You know, sir, that the children are weak, and that I
must take care of the female sheep and cows that are ◄sucking their mother's milk/nursing their young►. If I force them to walk
fast for a long distance in just one day, the animals will all die.
\v 14 You go ahead of me. I will lead the animals slowly, but I will walk as fast as the children and animals can walk. I will
catch up with you in Seir, \add in the land where the descendants of Edom
live\add*.” 
\v 15 Esau said, “Then allow me to leave with you some of the men who came with me, to protect you.” But Jacob replied, “◄Why
do that?/There is no need to do that!► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* The only thing that I want is for you to feel good toward me.”
\v 16 So on that day Esau left to return to Seir. 
\v 17 But \add instead of going to Seir\add*, Jacob and his family went to Succoth. There he built a house for himself and his
family, and built shelters for his livestock. That is the reason they named the place Succoth, which means 'shelters.'
\p
\v 18 Some time later, Jacob and his family left Paddan-Aram in Mesopotamia, and they traveled safely to Canaan land. There
they set up their tents in a field near Shechem city. 
\v 19 One of the leaders of the people in that area was named Hamor. Hamor had several sons. Jacob paid the sons of Hamor a
hundred pieces of silver for the piece of ground on which they set up their tents.
\v 20 He built a stone altar there, and named it El-Elohe Israel, which means 'God, the God of Israel.'
