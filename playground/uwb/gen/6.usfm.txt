\c 6  
\s People became very evil and did many evil actions 
\p
\v 1 When people began to become very numerous all over the earth, and many daughters were born to them,
\v 2 some of the men who ◄belonged to/believed in► God saw that some of the women who did not ◄belong to/believe in► God were
very beautiful. So they took whichever ones they chose to become their wives.
\v 3 Then Yahweh said, “My Spirit will not remain in people forever \f + \fr (OR, the breath of life will not remain in people forever).
They will die eventually. They will live not more than 120 years before they die (OR, there will be only 120 more years before
they die).” 
\p
\v 4 There were \add giants called\add* Nephils who lived on the earth at that time and later. During that time
\add some of the Nephil\add* men who ◄belonged to/believed in► God had sex \f + \fr euphemism \f* with women who did not ◄belong to/believe in►
God, and they gave birth to children. The Nephils were considered to be heroic fighters, and they became famous.
\p
\v 5 Yahweh saw that people on the earth had become very wicked, and everything they thought in their inner beings was evil
continually. 
\v 6 Yahweh was sorry that he had made people on the earth. 
\v 7 So Yahweh said, “I will completely destroy the people I made. I will also destroy all the animals and the creatures that
move close to the ground and the birds. None of them will remain on the earth, because I regret that I made them.”
\s Noah pleased God, so God planned to spare him 
\p
\v 8 But Yahweh was pleased with Noah. 
\v 9 This is what happened: Noah was a man whose behavior was always righteous. No one who lived at that time could criticize
him about anything. Noah lived in close fellowship with God. 
\v 10 Noah became the father of three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
\p
\v 11 At that time God considered that everyone else on earth was very wicked, and everywhere on the earth, people \f + \fr metonymy \f* were
acting cruelly and violently toward each other. 
\v 12 God was dismayed when he saw how evil people \f + \fr metonymy \f* were, because all people (OR, all living creatures) on the earth had
begun to behave in an evil way. 
\v 13 So God said to Noah, “I have decided to destroy all people, because all over the earth people are acting violently toward
each other. So I am about to get rid of them as well as everything else on the earth.
\v 14 Make for yourself a large boat from cypress wood. Make rooms inside it. Cover the outside and the inside with tar to make
it ◄waterproof/so that water cannot get in and sink the boat►. 
\v 15 This is the size you must make it: it shall be 150 yards/meters long, 25 yards/meters wide, and 15 yards/meters high.
\v 16 Make a roof for the boat. Leave a space of about ◄18 in./half a meter► between the sides and the roof to let air and
light enter (OR, the middle of the roof should be 18 inches higher than the sides). Make it with three decks inside, and put a
door in one side. 
\v 17 Listen carefully! I am about to bring a flood that will destroy every creature that lives beneath the sky. Everything on
the earth will die. 
\v 18 But I will make my agreement with you(sg) \f*: you and your wife, your sons and their wives will enter the boat.
\v 19 And I want to save all kinds of creatures. So you must also bring two of all living creatures, a male and a female, into
the boat with you, so that they also may remain alive. 
\v 20 Two of every kind of creature will come to you in order that by putting them in the boat you will keep them alive. They
will include two of each kind of bird and each kind of animal and each kind of creature that moves close to the ground.
\v 21 You must also take some of every kind of food that you and all these creatures will need, and store it in the boat.”
\v 22 So Noah did everything that God told him to do.
