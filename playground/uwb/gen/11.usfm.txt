\c 11  
\s Yahweh caused people to speak many different languages after they started to build a tower at Babel
\p
\v 1 At first, all the people in \f + \ft metonymy \f* the world spoke the same language \f + \ft doublet \f*.
\v 2 As people moved further east, they arrived at a plain in Babylonia region and began to live there.
\v 3 Then they said to each other, "Hey\f + \ft Or: Come on \f*, let's form bricks and burn them to make them hard, for building!" So they
used bricks instead of stones, and used tar instead of mortar\f + \ft Or: a mixture of cement, sand and lime \f* to hold them together.
\v 4 They said, "Hey, let's build a city for ourselves! We also ought to build a very high tower that reaches up to the sky! In
that way we will become famous! If we do not do this, we will be scattered all over the earth!"
\p
\v 5 So they began to build the city and the tower. Then Yahweh looked down and saw the city and the tower that those puny men
were building. 
\v 6 Yahweh said, "These people are one group that all speak the same language. If they have begun to do this now, then there
is nothing that they will decide to do that will be impossible for them\f + \ft Or: they will be able to do whatever they decide to do \f*
\f + \ft litotes \f*! 
\v 7 So, okay\f + \ft Or: now \f*, we will go down there and cause there to be many different languages, so that they will not be able to
understand what each other is saying." 
\p
\v 8 So Yahweh did that. As a result, the people stopped building the city, and Yahweh caused them to disperse all over the
earth. 
\v 9 The city was called Babel which means 'confusion,' because there Yahweh caused the people to become confused because the
people \f + \ft metonymy \f* all over the earth no longer spoke just one language. From there Yahweh caused them to disperse all over the
earth. 
\s Shem's descendants 
\p

\v 11 After Arpachshad was born, Shem lived 500 more years and became the father of more sons and daughters.
\v 12 When Arphachshad was 35 years old, he became the father of Shelah.

\v 15 After Eber was born, Shelah lived 403 more years and became the father of other sons and daughters.

\v 17 After Peleg was born, Eber lived 430 more years and became the father of other sons and daughters.

\v 25 After Terah was born, Nahor lived 119 more years and became the father of other sons and daughters.
\v 26 When Terah was 70 years old, his son Abram was born. Later, two other sons, Nahor and Haran were born.
\s Terah's descendants 
\p
\v 27 This is\f + \ft Or: I will now give \f* a list of the descendants of Terah: Terah's sons were Abram, Nahor, and Haran. Haran's son was
named Lot. 
\v 28 Haran died before his father died. He died in Ur \add city\add* in Chaldea land, where he was born.
\v 29 Abram and Nahor both married. Abram's wife was named Sarai, and Nahor's wife was named Milcah. Milcah and her younger
sister Iscah were the daughters of Haran. 
\v 30 Sarai was unable to bear any children. 
\v 31 Terah decided to leave Ur and go to live in Canaan land. So he took his son Abram and his grandson Lot, the son of Haran,
and Abram's wife Sarai with him. But instead of going to Canaan, they stopped at Haran
\add town\add* and lived there. 
\v 32 When Terah was 205 years old, he died there in Haran.
