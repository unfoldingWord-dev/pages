\c 13  
\s Abram and Lot separated 
\p
\v 1 So Abram and Sarai left Egypt, and they took along all his possessions, and Lot went with them to the Negev
\add desert\add*. 
\v 2 Abram was very rich. He owned a lot of livestock, silver and gold.
\v 3 They continued traveling from place to place from the Negev
\add desert\add* toward Bethel \add town\add* 
\v 4 to the place between Bethel and Ai where they had previously set up their tents, and where Abram had made a stone altar
and worshiped Yahweh. 
\v 5 Lot, who was traveling with Abram, also had flocks of sheep and goats and herds of cattle and tents.
\v 6-7 But they had so many animals that they could not all stay in the same area. There was not enough land to provide water
and food for all their animals. Furthermore, the descendants of Canaan and Perez were also living in that area, and the land
really belonged to them. So the men who took care of Abram's animals started quarreling about the herd with the men who took
care of Lot's animals. 
\v 8 Then Abram said to Lot, “Since we are close relatives, it is not good for us to quarrel, or for the men who take care of
your animals to quarrel with the men who take care of my animals.
\v 9 There is plenty of land for both of us. So we should separate. You can choose whatever part you want \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*. If you want
the area over there, I will stay here. If you want the area here, I will go over there.”
\v 10 Lot looked around toward Zoar \add town\add*, and saw that there was plenty of water all over the plain near the Jordan
\add River\add*. It was like the park/garden in Eden, and like the land in Egypt
\add near the Nile River\add*. [That was before Yahweh destroyed the towns of Sodom and Gomorrah which were on that plain.]
\v 11 So Lot chose the land in the plain of the Jordan \add River\add*. He left his uncle, Abram, and moved east.
\v 12 Abram stayed in the Canaan area, and Lot started to live near the cities in the plain of the Jordan
\add River\add*, and he set up his tents near Sodom \add city\add*.
\v 13 You need to know that people who lived there were extremely wicked.
\s Abram moved to Hebron 
\p
\v 14 After Abram and Lot separated, Yahweh said to Abram, “Look around at this whole area where you are. Look north and south,
look east and west. 
\v 15 I will give to you and your descendants all the land that you see; I will give it to you forever.
\v 16 I will cause your descendants to be as numerous as particles of dust! It will be easier to count the particles of dust
than it will be to count your descendants \f + \fr hyperbole \f*. 
\v 17 Walk through the land in every direction, because I am going to give it all to you.”
\v 18 So Abram took down the tents and moved to Hebron and started to live by the huge tree of Mamre. He placed a stone altar
there to make sacrifices to Yahweh.
