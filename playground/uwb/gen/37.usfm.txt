\c 37  
\s Joseph had two dreams about himself and his brothers 
\p
\v 1 Jacob continued to live in Canaan land, where his father had lived previously.
\v 2 ◄This is/I will now tell you► what happened to Jacob's family.
\p When his son Joseph was seventeen years old, he was taking care of the flocks of sheep and goats with some of his older
brothers. They were sons of his father's ◄concubines/female slaves that he had taken to be his secondary wives►. Joseph
sometimes told his father about bad things that his brothers were doing.
\p
\v 3 Jacob loved Joseph more than he loved any of his other children, because Joseph had been born when Jacob was an old man.
Jacob made for Joseph a long pretty robe that had long sleeves. 
\v 4 When Joseph's older brothers realized that their father loved him more than he loved any of them, they hated him. They
never spoke kindly to him. 
\p
\v 5 One night Joseph had a dream. He told his brothers about the dream.
\v 6 He said to them, “Listen to the dream I had! 
\v 7 In the dream, we were tying up bundles of wheat in the field. Suddenly my bundle stood up straight, and surprisingly, your
bundles gathered around my bundle and bowed down to it!” 
\v 8 His brothers said to him, “Do you think that some day you will rule over us? Are you going to be our king?” \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* They
hated him even more than before because of what he had told them about his dream.
\p
\v 9 Later he had another dream, and again he told his older brothers about it. He said, “Listen to this! I had another dream.
In this dream, the sun and moon and eleven stars were bowing down to me!”
\v 10 He also told his father about it. His father rebuked him, saying “What are you suggesting by that dream \f + \fk rhetorical question \f*? Do you
think it means that your mother and I and your older brothers will some day bow down to the ground in front of you?” \f + \fk rhetorical question \f*
\v 11 Joseph's older brothers were furious/angry with him, but his father just kept thinking about what the dream meant.
\p
\v 12 One day Joseph's older brothers went to take care of their father's sheep and goats that were eating grass near Shechem.
\v 13 Some time later, Jacob said to Joseph, “Your brothers are taking care of the sheep and goats near Shechem \f + \fk rhetorical question \f*. I am
going to send you there to see them.” Joseph replied, “Okay.” 
\v 14 Jacob said, “Go and see if they are doing okay, and if the flocks are doing okay. Then come back and give me a report.”
So Jacob sent Joseph from the valley where they were living, the valley where Hebron is located, to go north to find his
brothers. 
\p When Joseph arrived near Shechem \add city\add*, 
\v 15 while he was wandering around in the fields looking/searching for his brothers, a man saw him and asked him, “Whom are
you looking/searching for?” 
\v 16 Joseph replied, “I am looking for my older brothers. Can you tell me where they are taking care of their sheep and
goats?” 
\v 17 The man replied, “They are not here anymore. I heard one of them saying, ‘Let's take the sheep and goats and go to Dothan
town.’ ” 
\s Joseph was taken to Egypt after his brothers sold him. 
\p So Joseph left there and went north, and found his older brothers near Dothan.
\v 18 But they saw him when he was still far away, and they decided to kill him.
\v 19 They said to each other things like, “Here comes that dreamer!”
\v 20 “Hey, let's kill him, and then throw his body into one of the pits/cisterns. Then we will tell people that a
ferocious/wild animal attacked and killed him and ate him. And then we will ◄find out whether his dreams come true/make sure
that his dreams do not come true►!” 
\p
\v 21 Reuben heard what they were saying, so he tried to persuade them not to kill \f + \fk metonymy \f* Joseph. He said, “No, we should not
kill him. 
\v 22 Do not even shed his blood! We can throw him into this pit/cistern in the desert, but we should nor harm him \f + \fk metonymy \f*.” He
said that, and then left them, planning to rescue Joseph later and take him back to his father.
\p
\v 23 So when Joseph arrived where his older brothers were, they seized him and ripped off his pretty robe with long sleeves.
\v 24 Then they took him and threw him into the pit/cistern. But the pit/cistern was dry; there was no water in it.
\p
\v 25 After they sat down to eat some food, they looked up and saw a ◄caravan/group of travelers►, descendants of Ishmael,
coming from the Gilead area. Their camels were loaded with bags of spices and nice-smelling resins. They were going down to
Egypt to sell those things there. 
\v 26 Judah said to his \add older and younger\add* brothers, “If we kill our younger brother and hide his body, ◄what will we
gain?/we will not gain anything!► \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* 
\v 27 So, instead of harming him, let's sell him to these men who are descendants of Ishmael. Don't forget, he is our own
younger brother!” So they all agreed to do that. 
\p
\v 28 When those traders from the Midian area came near, Joseph's brothers pulled him up out of the pit/cistern. Then they sold
him to the men from Midian for 20 pieces of silver. The traders then took Joseph to Egypt.
\p
\v 29 When Reuben returned to the pit/cistern, he saw that his younger brother was not there. He was so grieved that he tore
his clothes. 
\v 30 He went back to his \add younger\add* brothers and said, “The boy is not in the pit/cistern! What can I do now?” \f + \fk rhetorical question \f*
\p
\v 31 They did not dare to tell their father what they had done. So, they decided to invent a story about what had happened.
They got Joseph's robe. Then they killed a goat and dipped the robe in the goat's blood.
\v 32 They took that pretty robe back to their father and said, “We found this robe! Look at it. Is it your son's robe?”
\v 33 He recognized it, and he said, “Yes, it is my son's robe! Some ferocious/wild animal must have attacked and killed him! I
am sure that the animal has torn Joseph to pieces!” 
\p
\v 34 Jacob was so grieved that he tore his clothes. He put on ◄sackcloth/clothes that people wear when they are mourning for
someone who has died►. He mourned/cried for his son for many days.
\v 35 All of his children came to try to comfort him, but he did not pay attention to what they said. He said, “No, I will
still be mourning/crying when I die and go to be with my son.” So Joseph's father continued to cry because of what had happened
to his son. 
\p
\v 36 In the meantime, the men/traders from Midian took Joseph to Egypt and sold him to Potiphar, who was one of the king's
officials. He was the captain of the soldiers who protected the king.
