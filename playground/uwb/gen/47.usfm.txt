\c 47  
\s Jacob blessed the king of Egypt 
\p
\v 1-2 Joseph chose five of his \add older\add* brothers to go with him to talk to the king. He introduced his
\add older\add* brothers to the king, and then he said, "My father and my
\add older\add* brothers \add and younger brother\add* have come from Canaan land. They have brought all their sheep and goats
and cattle and everything else that they own, and they are living now in Goshen region."
\v 3 The king asked the brothers, "What work do you do?" They replied to the king, "We are shepherds, just as our ancestors
were." 
\v 4 They also said to him, "We have come here to live for a while in this land, because the famine is very severe in Canaan,
and our animals have no pasture\f + \ft Or: grass to eat \f* there. So now, please let us live in the Goshen region."
\p
\v 5 The king said to Joseph, "I am happy that your father and your
\add older\add* brothers \add and younger brother\add* have come to you.
\v 6 They can live wherever you want in the whole country of Egypt. Give your father and your brothers the best part of the
land. They can live in Goshen. And if you know that any of them have any special ability to work with livestock, have them be
in charge of my own livestock, too." 
\p
\v 7 Then Joseph brought his father Jacob into the palace and introduced him to the king. Jacob asked God to bless the king.
\v 8 Then the king asked Jacob, "How old are you?" 
\v 9 Jacob replied, "I have been traveling around for 130 years. I have not lived as long as my ancestors, but my life has been
full of troubles." 
\v 10 Then Jacob again asked God to bless the king and left him.
\p
\v 11 That is how Joseph enabled his father and \add older\add* brothers
\add and younger brother\add* to start living in Egypt. As the king had commanded, he gave them property in the best part of
the land, in Goshen, which is now called Rameses. 
\v 12 Joseph also provided food for all his father's family. The amounts that he gave them were according to how many children
each of them had. 
\s Joseph arranged for people to buy grain from him during the famine
\p
\v 13 There was no food growing in the whole region, because the famine was very severe. The people of Egypt and Canaan \f + \ft metonymy \f*
became weak because they did not have enough food to eat. 
\v 14 Joseph collected all the money that the people in Egypt and Canaan paid for the grain they were buying from him, and he
brought the money to the king's palace. 
\v 15 When the people of Egypt and Canaan had spent all their money for grain, they all kept coming to Joseph and saying,
"Please give us some food! If you do not give us grain, we will die \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*! We have used all our money to buy food, and we have
no money left!" 
\v 16 Joseph replied, "Since your money is all gone, bring me your livestock. If you do that, I will sell you food in exchange
for your livestock." 
\v 17 So they brought their livestock to Joseph. He gave them food in exchange for their horses, their sheep and goats, their
cattle, and their donkeys. 
\p
\v 18 When that year was ended, the next year they came to him and said, "We cannot hide this from you: we have no more money,
and now our livestock belongs to you. We have only our bodies and our land to give to you. We have nothing else left.
\v 19 If you do not give us some food, we will die!\f + \ft Or: Do you want to watch us die? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* If you do not give us seeds, our
fields will become useless [IDI]. Buy us and our land in exchange for food. Then we will be the king's slaves, and he will own
the land. Give us seeds that we can plant and grow food, in order that we will not die, and in order that our land will not
become like a desert." 
\p
\v 20 So Joseph bought all the farms in Egypt for the king. The people of Egypt each sold their land to him because the famine
was very severe, and they had no other way to get money to buy food. So all the farms became the king's farms.
\v 21 As a result, Joseph caused all the people from one border of the country to the other to become the king's slaves.
\v 22 But he did not buy the priests' land, because they received food from the king regularly, so the food that the king gave
them was enough for them. That is the reason they did not sell their land to him.
\p
\v 23 Joseph said to the people who sold themselves and their land to him, "Listen to me! Today I have bought you and your land
for the king. So here are seeds for you so that you can plant them in the ground.
\v 24 But when you harvest the crop, you must give one-fifth of the crop to the king. The rest of the crop you can keep, to be
seed to plant in the fields, and to be food for you and your children and for everyone else in your household to eat."
\v 25 They replied, "You have saved our lives! We want you to be pleased with us. And we will be the king's slaves."
\p
\v 26 So Joseph made a law about all the land in Egypt, stating that one-fifth of the crops that are harvested belongs to the
king. That law still exists. Only the land that belonged to the priests did not become the king's land.
\p
\v 27 Jacob and his family started to live in Egypt, in the Goshen region. They acquired property there. Many children were
born to them there. As a result, their population increased greatly.
\s Jacob made Joseph promise to not bury him in Egypt after he died.
\p
\v 28 Jacob lived in Egypt seventeen years. Altogether he lived 147 years.
\v 29 When it was almost time for him to die, he summoned his son Joseph and said to him, "If I have pleased you, put your hand
between my thighs to solemnly promise that you will be kind to me and faithfully do what I am now asking you: when I die, do
not bury me here in Egypt. 
\v 30 Instead, when I die and join my ancestors who have died previously, take my body out of Egypt, and bury it in Canaan
where my ancestors are buried." Joseph replied, "I will do what you have said."
\v 31 Jacob said, "Swear\f + \ft Or: Solemnly promise \f* to me that you will do it!" So Joseph swore to do it. Then Jacob turned over in
bed, bowed his head, and worshiped God.
