\c 3  
\s Those first people sinned by disobeying God 
\p
\v 1 The snake was more cunning than all the other wild animals that Yahweh God had made.
\add One day Satan gave to\add* the snake \add the ability to talk to the
woman\add*. He said to her, "Did God really say to you, 'Do not eat the fruit from any of the trees in the park\f + \ft Or: garden \f*'?"
\v 2 The woman replied, "\add What God said was\add*, 'Do not eat the fruit from the tree that is in the middle of the
park\f + \ft Or: garden \f* or touch it. If you do that, you will die. 
\v 3 But you can eat fruit from any of the other trees.' " 
\v 4 The snake said to the woman, "No, you will certainly not die. God said that
\v 5  \add only\add* because he knows that when you eat fruit from that tree,
\add you will understand new things. It will be as though\add* your eyes are opened \f + \ft metaphor \f*, and you will know what is good
\add to do\add* and what is evil \add to do\add*, just as God does."
\v 6 The woman saw that the fruit on that tree was good to eat, and it was very beautiful, and she desired it because
\add she thought\add* it would make her wise. So she picked some of the fruit and ate it. Then she gave some to her husband,
and he ate it. 
\v 7 Immediately \add it was as though\add* their eyes were opened, and they realized that they were naked, so they were
ashamed. So they \add picked\add* some fig leaves and fastened them together to make clothes for themselves.
\p
\v 8  \add Late that afternoon\add*, when a cool breeze was blowing, they heard the sound\f + \ft Or: footsteps \f* of Yahweh as he was walking
in the park\f + \ft Or: garden \f*. So the man and his wife hid themselves among the bushes in the park\f + \ft Or: garden \f*,
\add so that Yahweh God would not see them\add*. 
\v 9 But Yahweh God called to the man, saying to him, "Why are you
\add trying to hide from me\add*?" 
\v 10 The man replied, "I heard the sound of your \add footsteps\f + \ft Or: walking \f*\add* in the garden, and I was naked, so I was afraid
and I hid myself." 
\v 11 God said, "How did you find out you were naked \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*? It must be because you ate some of the fruit
\add from the tree\add* that I told you, 'Do not eat its fruit.' " \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 12 The man said, "You gave me this woman to be with me. She is the one who gave me some of the fruit from that tree, and so
I ate it." 
\v 13 Then Yahweh God said to the woman, "Why did you do such a thing?" The woman replied, "I ate it because the snake deceived
me." 
\v 14 Then Yahweh God said to the snake, "Because you did this, of all the livestock and the wild animals, I will curse\f + \ft Or: punish \f*
you alone. As a result, you \add and all other snakes\add* will move very close to the ground on your bellies, and so what you
eat will have dirt \add on it\add* as long as you live. 
\v 15 And I will cause you and the woman to act hostilely toward each other, and I will cause your brood and her descendants to
act hostilely toward each other. You will strike at the heel \add of one
descendant\add* of hers, but he will strike your head." 
\v 16 Then Yahweh said to the woman, "You will have great pain when you give birth to children; you will suffer great pain as
your children are being born \f + \ft doublet \f*. You will greatly desire your husband
\add to show affection for you\add*, but he will rule over you."
\v 17 Then he said to the man, "You heeded what your wife said, and you ate some of the fruit
\add of the tree\add* concerning which I commanded you saying, 'Do not eat it.' So I will make it difficult
\add to grow things in\add* the ground because of what you did. You will have to work hard as long as you live to produce
things from the ground to eat. 
\v 18 Thornbushes and thistle plants and other weeds will grow \add and prevent what you have planted from
growing\add*. And for food, you will have to eat things that just grow in your fields.
\v 19  \add All your life\add* you will sweat as you work hard to produce food to eat. Then you will die \f + \ft euphemism \f*, and your
\add body will be buried\add* in the ground. I made you from soil, so, since I made your body from soil, when you
\add die and are buried your body will decay\add* and become soil again."
\p
\v 20  \add The man, whose name was\add* Adam, named his wife Eve,
\add which means 'living'\add*, because she became the ancestor of all living people.
\v 21 Then Yahweh God \add killed some animals and\add* made clothes from their skins for Adam and his wife.
\p
\v 22 Then Yahweh said, "Look! Those two have become like us because they know what is good to do and what is evil
\add to do\add*. So now, it will not be good if they reach out and pick and eat
\add some of the fruit from\add* the tree \add which enables people who eat
it\add* to live \add forever\add*!" 
\v 23 So Yahweh God expelled the man and his wife from the garden of Eden. Yahweh God had created Adam from the ground, but now
he forced him to till that same ground \add to produce food to eat\add*.
\v 24 After he expelled them, on the east side of the garden he placed cherubim\f + \ft Or: creatures with wings \f* and an angel holding a
flaming sword which flashed back and forth, in order to block the entrance, so that people could not go back to the tree that
enables people \add who eat its fruit\add* to live \add forever\add*.
