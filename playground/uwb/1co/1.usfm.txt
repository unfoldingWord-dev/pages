\v 1 I, Paul, \add am writing this letter\add*. Sosthenes, our fellow believer, is with
\add me as I write it\add*. \add God\add* appointed me to be an apostle of Christ Jesus because that is what God desired.
\v 2  \add I am sending this letter\add* to you who belong to the congregations of God in Corinth
\add city\add*. You have been set apart \add by God\add* {\add God\add* has set you apart} for himself because of your close
relationship with\f + \ft Or: you \f* belong to Christ Jesus. God has appointed you to be his people and to live in a morally pure way, just
like he has appointed all the people everywhere who belong to him to live in a morally pure way. You and they have trusted in
the Lord Jesus Christ \f + \ft metonymy \f*. He is their sovereign Lord as well as the sovereign Lord of all of
us\add (inc)\add* who have trusted in him. 
\p
\v 3 We\add (exc)\add* desire that God, who is our \add heavenly\add* Father, and Jesus Christ, who is our sovereign Lord, will
continue to act kindly toward you and cause you to experience \add inner\add* peace.
\s 1 Corinthians 1:4-9 
\s I thank God for you and for all the spiritual abilities that he has given you.
\p
\v 4 I very often \f + \ft hyperbole \f* thank God concerning you because he has acted toward you kindly, acting in ways that you do not
deserve. He has done this because of your having a close relationship with\f + \ft Or: being united to \f* Christ Jesus.
\v 5 That is, \add God\add* has very abundantly \f + \ft hyperbole \f* helped you spiritually because of your having a close relationship
with\f + \ft Or: being united to \f* Christ. Specifically, God has abundantly \f + \ft hyperbole \f* enabled you to speak messages
\add that his Spirit revealed to you\add*, and he has abundantly enabled you to know many things \f + \ft hyperbole \f* that his Spirit revealed
to you. 
\v 6 In that way, \add he\add* confirmed to you that what we\add (exc)\add* proclaimed about Christ is true.
\v 7 As a result, while you wait for our Lord Jesus Christ to return, within your group you truly possess \f + \ft litotes \f* every ability
that \add God's\add* Spirit gives \add to believers\add*. 
\v 8 God will also cause you to steadfastly \add trust Christ to the very end of your
lives\add* \f + \ft euphemism \f*. The result will be that God will not consider you guilty
\add of any sin\add* when our Lord Jesus Christ returns to earth \f + \ft metonymy \f*.
\v 9 You can depend on God to do that. He is the one who chose you to become intimately associated with his Son, Jesus Christ,
who is our Lord. 
\s 1 Corinthians 1:10-17 
\s Stop dividing into groups in your congregations on the basis of which Christian leader you favor.
\p
\v 10 My fellow believers, by the authority of \f + \ft metonymy \f* our Lord Jesus Christ, I urgently appeal to all of you to agree with one
another. What I mean is, stop dividing into groups. Instead, be united \f + \ft metaphor \f* concerning what you understand
\add about spiritual matters\add* and be united in what you decide.
\v 11 My fellow believers, \add I urge this\add* because some members of Chloe's household have told me that you are quarreling
among yourselves. 
\v 12 That is, some of you say, "Paul is the one to whom we \add are
loyal\add*," and others say, "Peter is the one to whom we \add are
loyal\add*," and still others say, "Christ is the one to whom we
\add are loyal\add*." 
\v 13  \add It is ridiculous that\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add you are quarreling
and\add* dividing up \add into groups instead of being loyal to\add* Christ alone. Christ certainly has not divided himself
into parts and distributed those parts out \add to groups of people who oppose each
other\add*!\f + \ft Or: Has Christ divided himself into parts and distributed those parts out
\add to groups of people who oppose each other\add*? \f* \f + \ft metaphor, rhetorical question \f* I, Paul, certainly did not die on the cross for you!\f + \ft Or: Did I,
Paul die on the cross for you? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* When you were baptized {When someone baptized you}, you certainly did not promise that
you were submitting to me!\f + \ft Or: did you promise that you were submitting to me? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 14 I thank \add God\add* that Crispus and Gaius were the only ones from among you whom I baptized.
\v 15 As a result, no one \add there in Corinth except those two\add* can say, "Paul baptized me so that I would become his
disciple\f + \ft Or: submissive to him \f*." 
\v 16  \add Now I remember that\add* I also baptized the household of Stephanas, but I do not remember baptizing anyone else
\add there\add*. 
\v 17 Christ sent me not \add primarily\add* to baptize people but to preach the good message about him. When I do that, he
does not want me to use words that human philosophers \add consider\add* wise \f + \ft irony \f*. I do not want the message about
\add what\add* he \add accomplished when he was nailed to\add* the cross \f + \ft metonymy \f* to lose its power.
\s 1 Corinthians 1:18-19 
\s The message about Christ dying on the cross is the means of saving us who believe it.
\p
\v 18 Those who are perishing spiritually \add because they do not believe that message
consider\add* that the message \add about what Christ accomplished when he was nailed to
the\add* cross \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add is\add* foolish. But to us who are being saved {whom
\add God\add* is saving} \add spiritually because we believe that
message\add*, it \add demonstrates that\add* God acts powerfully
\add in order to save us\add*. 
\v 19  \add It is like what God said that\add* a prophet wrote long ago,
\p \add By the things that I will do\add*, I will show that the ideas of those who
\add think\add* \f + \ft irony \f* they are wise are completely useless. I will ignore the ideas that they think are \f + \ft irony \f* so smart.
\s 1 Corinthians 1:20-25 
\s Some people think that the message about Christ is foolish, but to us whom God has chosen, it shows God's power.
\p
\v 20 So, do you know \add what God thinks\add* about what \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* people who \f + \ft irony \f* consider themselves to be wise and scholars
and philosophers say? \add He does not pay attention to what they say,
because\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* he has shown clearly that what unbelievers \add think
is\add* \f + \ft irony \f* wise is \add not wise at all\add*, but is really foolish.
\v 21 God, acting very wisely, made it impossible for unbelievers to know God by doing what they thought was \f + \ft irony \f* wise.
Instead, he was happy to save those who trust \add in Christ\add* as the result of their hearing
\add the message that\add* was proclaimed to them, a message that others consider to be foolish.
\v 22 The Jews want \add people to prove, by performing\add* miracles,
\add that their message is true\add*. The non-Jews want to hear only messages consisting of talk that they consider to be very
wise. 
\v 23 As for us, we proclaim \add the message about what\add* Christ
\add accomplished for us when\add* he was nailed {\add when they\add* nailed him} to the cross. That message offends Jews
\add because they do not think that the Messiah will die, and\add* non-Jews think it is \f + \ft irony \f* a foolish message.
\v 24 But to us whom God has chosen to belong to himself, both Jews and non-Jews, that message shows that God acted powerfully
and wisely \add by sending\add* Christ \add to die\add* for us. 
\v 25  \add Unbelievers may think\add* \f + \ft irony \f* \add that\add* God was
\add acting\add* foolishly \add by doing that\add*, but \add the truth is
that\add* he was acting more wisely than unbelievers who \add think
that\add* \f + \ft irony \f* they are wise. And unbelievers may think that God was
\add acting\add* weakly \add by sending his son to die\add*, but he was acting more powerfully than unbelievers who
\add think\add* \f + \ft irony \f* \add that they\add* act powerfully. 
\s 1 Corinthians 1:26-31 
\s God chose mostly despised, not important, people to belong to Christ; so you should boast only about him.
\p
\v 26 My fellow believers, remember what \add kind of people you\add* were when God chose you.
\add Not many of you\add* whom he chose are people whom \add unbelievers considered to
be\add* wise. Very few of you were considered to be important. Very few of you came from families with a high social standing.
\v 27 Instead, it was \add usually\add* those whom \add unbelievers considered to
be\add* foolish whom God chose. He did that in order to shame\f + \ft Or: discredit \f* those whom
\add unbelievers consider\add* \f + \ft irony \f* wise. It was \add usually\add* those
\add whom unbelievers\add* considered \f + \ft irony \f* unimportant whom God chose, in order to shame\f + \ft Or: discredit \f* those whom unbelievers
consider important. 
\v 28 It was usually those who are despised and considered {whom
\add unbelievers\add* despise and consider} worthless whom God chose, in order to make completely ineffective those
\add whom unbelievers consider to be important\add*. 
\v 29  \add He did that\add* in order that no one could boast to God about being wise or important.
\v 30 It is because of what God \add has done\add* that you have a close relationship with\f + \ft Or: belong to \f* Christ Jesus. God
\add accomplished\add* his wise \add plan to save us\add* by what Christ did for us. As a result of what Christ did, God erases
the record of our sins, sets us apart for himself, and frees us from our being guilty
\add for our sins\add*. 
\v 31 So, it is \bd the Lord\bd* whom we should boast about, \add not about one spiritual leader being better than
another\add*. We should do as \add a prophet\f + \ft Or: Jeremiah\add* \f* wrote
\add in the Scriptures that we should do\add*: 
\q Those who boast should boast \add only\add* about what the Lord
\add has done\add*.
