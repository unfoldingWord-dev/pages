\c 4  
\s 1 Corinthians 4:1-7 
\s Stop judging your leaders' value; do not be proud of one and despise another.
\p
\v 1 So, people ought to consider us \add apostles\add* (OR, Apollos and me) to be
\add merely\add* servants of Christ. God has given to us\add (exc) the work
of\add* telling others the message that God has now revealed to us.
\v 2 With respect to doing that, those who are given work are required {give others some work to do require them} to do that
work faithfully. 
\v 3 I am not concerned whether you or \add the judges in\add* some court decide whether I have done my work faithfully or not.
I do not even judge myself \add about that\add*. 
\v 4 I do not think that I have done anything wrong, but that does not prove that I have done nothing wrong. The Lord is the
one who judges me. 
\v 5 So stop judging any of us\add (exc)\add* before the time \add when God judges
everyone\add* [MTY]! Do not judge us before the Lord comes. He is the one who will reveal the sinful things that people have
done secretly. He will even reveal what people have thought in their minds. At that time God will praise each person
as\add each one of them deserves\add*. 
\p
\v 6 My fellow believers, I have \add told you\add* all these things as illustrations of myself and Apollos. I have done this
for your sake, in order that you may learn \add to live according
to\add* the saying, “Do not act contrary to what is {what they have} written
\add in the Scriptures\add*.” If you follow that rule, you will not be proud of one
\add spiritual leader\add* and despise another. 
\v 7 ◄No one has made any of you superior to others!/Why do any of you think that you are superior to others?► [RHQ]
\add All the abilities\add* that you have, ◄you received\add from
God\add*./did you not receive them \add from God\add*?► [RHQ] So if you received them all
\add from God\add*, ◄you should not boast \add thinking\add*, “I got these abilities
\add from myself\add*, \add not from God\add*!”/why do you boast
\add thinking\add*, “I got these abilities \add from myself\add*,
\add not from God\add*?”► [RHQ] 
\s 1 Corinthians 4:8-13 
\s It is disgusting that you are so proud of your spiritual gifts and that you despise us apostles.
\p
\v 8  \add It is disgusting that you act as though\add* [IRO] you have already received everything that you need
\add spiritually\add*. You act as though [IRO] you were \add spiritually\add* rich (OR, you had received all
\add the spiritual gifts you need\add*). You act as though [IRO] you had already begun to rule as kings with Christ. Well, I
wish that you really were ruling \add with him\add*, in order that we
\add apostles\add* might also rule with you! 
\v 9 But it seems as though God has put us \add apostles\add* on display at the end of the line.
We\add (exc)\add* are like men who have been condemned to die, who have been put in the arena where everyone can see
\add the wild animals\add* killing them. And not only people, but even angels all over the world
\add are watching us, as people\add* watch those who are performing a play
\add in a theater\add*. 
\v 10 Many people consider us to be [IRO] fools because \add we preach
about\add* Christ, but you proudly \add think [IRO] that\add* you are wise because ◄of your close relationship with/you belong
to► Christ. Many people \add consider us\add* [IRO] to be unimpressive, but you
\add proudly think that you\add* impress others. People respect you, but they do not respect us.
\v 11 Up to this present time we have often been hungry. We have often been thirsty. We have ragged clothes. Often we have been
beaten {others have beaten us}. We \add have traveled so much that
we\add* have no regular homes to live in. 
\v 12 We work very hard \add to earn a living\add*. When we are cursed
\add by people\add* {When \add people\add* curse us}, we \add ask God
to\add* bless them. When we are persecuted {When \add people\add* cause us to suffer}, we endure it.
\v 13 When we are slandered \add by people\add* {When \add people\add* slander us}, we reply kindly to them. Up to this present
time \add unbelievers\add* \add consider us to be worthless\add* [MET],
\add as though we were\add* garbage and a rubbish heap. 
\s 1 Corinthians 4:14-17 
\s Imitate the way in which I serve Christ. 
\p
\v 14 I am writing this to you, not to make you feel ashamed, but instead to warn you as
\add though you were\add* my dear children. 
\v 15 I say that because as \add an apostle of\add* Christ Jesus I
\add was the first one who\add* proclaimed the good message to you. As a result, I was the one who enabled you to receive
eternal life. So even if there were thousands of Christians who instruct you [MET], I am the only one who became
\add like\add* a father to you. 
\v 16 So I urge you to \add live for Christ\add* the way I do. 
\v 17 In order to \add help you do that\add*, I have sent/will be sending Timothy to you. I love him
\add as though he were\add* my son. He serves the Lord faithfully. He will remind you of the way I conduct my life
\add as one who\add* ◄has a close relationship with/belongs to► the Lord. The way I conduct my life is the same as how I teach
\add others to live\add* in all the congregations \add to whom I have
spoken\add*. 
\s 1 Corinthians 4:18-21 
\s I hope you will change your thinking, so I do not have to punish you when I come there.
\p
\v 18 Some of you have become proud, thinking that I will not come there
\add to rebuke your congregation about what they are doing\add*.
\v 19 But if the Lord wants me to come, I will come to you soon. Then I will not
\add pay any attention to\add* what those proud people say. Instead, I will find out
\add whether they have God's\add* power. 
\v 20 Remember that God \add judges whether or not we are letting
him\add* rule \add our lives\add*, not by \add listening to how we\add* talk, but
\add by seeing whether his\add* power \add is present\add* ◄\add among us/in our
lives\add*►. 
\v 21 So which do you prefer? Do you want me to come to you and punish you
\add because you have not changed your ways\add*, or shall I come to you and act lovingly and gently toward you
\add because you have done what I told you to do?\add*
