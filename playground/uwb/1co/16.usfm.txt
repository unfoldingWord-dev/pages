\c 16  
\s 1 Corinthians 16:1-4 
\s You should set aside funds each week for the offering to be sent to believers in Jerusalem.
\p
\v 1 Now \add I will reply to another question that you asked. You
asked\add* about the \add money you are\add* collecting \add to send\add* to God's people
\add in Jerusalem\add*. Do what I told the congregations in Galatia to do.
\v 2 Every Sunday each of you should set aside \add at home\add* some funds \f + \ft euphemism \f*
\add for this purpose\add*, in proportion to how much \add God\add* has prospered you. Then you should save it up, so that when
I arrive there, you will not need to collect \add any more money. Choose some men whom you approve of, to
take\add* this money to Jerusalem. 
\v 3 Then, when I arrive, I will write letters stating that you have authorized these men to take the funds there.
\v 4 And if \add you\add* \f + \ft Or: \add I\add* \f* think that it is appropriate, I will go with them.
\s 1 Corinthians 16:5-12 
\s I plan to spend some time with you. Treat Timothy respectfully when he arrives. Apollos plans to visit you later.
\p
\v 5 Now I plan to travel through Macedonia \add province\add*. I
\add plan to\add* come to see you, but I want to go through Macedonia first.
\v 6 Perhaps I will stay with you for a short while, or I may stay with you for the whole winter, in order that you yourselves
can provide some of the things \add that I will need\add* \f + \ft euphemism \f* for my next trip.
\v 7 I do not want to see you just for a short time and then continue my trip. I am hoping to stay with you for a while, if the
Lord \add Jesus\add* allows me to do that. 
\v 8 But I will stay \add here\add* in Ephesus \add city\add* until
\add after\add* the Pentecost \add festival\add*. 
\v 9  \add I want to do that\add* because \add God\add* has given me a great opportunity \f + \ft metaphor \f*
\add to proclaim his good message here\add*. \add As a result of my work here, he is
producing\add* great results. I also want to stay here because there are many people here who oppose
\add my work, and I need to oppose them\add*. 
\p
\v 10 When Timothy arrives \add there in Corinth\add*, treat him respectfully \f + \ft litotes \f*, because he is working for the Lord just as
I am. 
\v 11 Do not let anyone despise him. And when he leaves there, give him some of the things that he needs
\add for his trip\add* \f + \ft euphemism \f* \add here\add*, and also \add ask God
to\add* bless him. I am waiting for him to come, along with the other fellow believers
\add who have been traveling with him\add*. 
\p
\v 12  \add You also asked\add* about our fellow believer, Apollos. I urged him strongly that he should go back to you with the
three fellow believers \add who came here from Corinth\add*. He was not at all willing to go
\add now\add*, but he will go later, when he has an opportunity.
\s 1 Corinthians 16:13-24 
\s I give you my final instructions, greetings from others, and my final blessings.
\p
\v 13 Be on guard \add against anything that would hinder you spiritually\add*. You have believed
\add the true message\add*; continue believing it firmly. Be courageous. Keep strong
\add in your relationship with God\add*. 
\v 14 Act in a loving \add way\add* in everything that \add you do\add*.
\p
\v 15 You know that Stephanas and his family were the first ones
\add there\add* in Achaia \add province to believe in Christ\add* \f + \ft idiom \f*. They have devoted themselves to helping God's people.
\v 16 My fellow believers, I urge you to submit yourselves to them and to people like them who do
\add God's\add* work and who work hard. 
\v 17 I was glad when Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus arrived here
\add from Corinth\add*, because \add they did things for\add* me that you were not able to do
\add because you were not with me\add*. 
\v 18 They comforted and encouraged me \f + \ft synecdoche \f*, and \add I expect that this news from
me\add* will do the same for you. You should honor \add them, and you should also
honor\add* others like them. 
\p
\v 19 The congregations \add here\add* in Asia \add province\add* send their greetings to\f + \ft Or: say that they are thinking fondly
of \f* you. Aquila and \add his wife\add* Priscilla and the congregation that meets in their house send their warm greetings
to\f + \ft Or: say that they are thinking fondly of \f* you because both they and you belong to the Lord.
\v 20 All your fellow believers \add here\add* send their greetings to\f + \ft Or: say that they are thinking of \f* you. Greet each other
affectionately, as fellow believers \add should\add*. 
\p
\v 21 Now I, Paul, having taken the pen from the hand of my secretary, write with my own hand to say that I am thinking fondly
of you\f + \ft Or: to \f* give you my greetings. I do this to show you that this letter really comes from me.
\p
\v 22 I pray that God will\f + \ft Or: May God \f* curse, Or: cause bad things to happen to anyone who does not love the Lord Jesus. I pray that
our Lord will come soon\f + \ft Or: May our Lord come soon \f*! 
\p
\v 23 I pray that our Lord Jesus will\f + \ft Or: May \f* our Lord Jesus continue to act toward you all kindly\f + \ft Or: in ways that you do not
deserve. \f* 
\p
\v 24 I love all of you who have a close relationship with Christ Jesus.
