\c 2  
\s 1 Corinthians 2:1-5 
\s God showed that my message was true by the powerful things that he did, not because I spoke in a way that would make people
think highly of me. 
\p
\v 1 My fellow believers, when I came to you, I proclaimed to you the message that God had revealed to me. But I did not
proclaim it using eloquent words that would make people think highly of me, nor did I argue in a way that unbelievers would
think was very wise. 
\v 2 I did that because I decided that I would speak only about Jesus Christ. Specifically, I told you
\add what he accomplished for us when\add* he was killed by being nailed
{\add when they\add* killed him by nailing him} to a cross. 
\v 3 Furthermore, when I was with you, I felt that I was not adequate
\add to do what Christ wanted me to do\add*. I was afraid \add that I would not be able to do
it\add*, and because of that I was trembling very much. 
\v 4 When I taught you and preached to you, I did not speak words that
\add unbelievers would consider\add* \f + \ft irony \f* wise in order to convince them that my message was true. Instead,
\add God's\add* Spirit showed that it was true by \add enabling me
to\add* powerfully \add perform miracles\add*. 
\v 5  \add I taught and preached that way\add* in order that you might believe
\add my message\add*, not because you heard words that people \add considered to
be\add* \f + \ft irony \f* wise, but \add because you realized\add* God's power.
\s 1 Corinthians 2:6-16 
\s Unbelievers do not consider that my message is wise, because I speak what God's Spirit reveals to me.
\p
\v 6 I do teach a message that people who are \add spiritually\add* mature
\add consider to\add* be wise. But I do not teach a message that unbelievers
\add consider to be\add* wise. I also do not teach a message that unbelieving rulers in the world consider to be wise.
\add What they think about it does not matter\add*, because \add some
day\add* they will Â…lose their power\f + \ft Or: not be ruling anymore \f*. 
\v 7 Instead, I teach about what God planned wisely \add long ago\add*. It is something that people did not know about
previously because \add God\add* did not reveal it previously. But God determined before he created the world that he would
greatly benefit us by his wise plan. 
\v 8 None of those who rule this world knew that wise plan. If they had known it, they would not have nailed our wonderful Lord
to the cross. 
\v 9 But \add we believers need to remember these words that a prophet\add* wrote
\add in the Scriptures\add*: 
\q Things that no one has ever seen, 
\q things that no one ever heard, 
\q things that no one ever thought could happen, 
\q those are the things that God has prepared for those who love him.
\p
\v 10 God has caused his Spirit to reveal those things to us\add (inc)\add* believers. His Spirit can do that because he knows
thoroughly the meaning of all things. He even knows the things about God that are very difficult to understand.
\v 11 Only a person himself \f + \ft Or: a person's spirit) knows what he is thinking. Similarly, only God's Spirit knows what God is
thinking. 
\v 12 It was not the ideas that unbelievers teach that we accepted. Instead, it was the Spirit who came from God that we
received, in order that we might know the things that God has freely done for us.
\v 13 Those are the things that I tell you about. As I do that, I do not tell you things that someone
\add whom others thought\add* was \f + \ft irony \f* wise taught me. Instead, I tell you truths that
\add God's\add* Spirit taught \add me\add*, and I explain those spiritual truths to people whose thinking is guided by God's
Spirit (OR, I teach spiritual \add truths to\add* spiritual \add people\add*).
\v 14 Those who are unbelievers reject the truths that \add God's\add* Spirit teaches
us\add (inc \f*\add*, because they \add consider those truths to be\add* foolish. They cannot understand them, because it is God's
Spirit who enables us to evaluate those truths correctly, \add and those people do not have God's
Spirit\add*. 
\v 15 We who have God's Spirit can judge correctly the \add value
of\add* all truths \add that the Spirit reveals\add*, but \add unbelievers\add* cannot evaluate us correctly.
\v 16 As \add one of our prophets wrote: \add* 
\q No human \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* has known what the Lord is thinking. 
\q No human \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* is able to instruct him. 
\q But we believers are able to think about things \f + \ft metonymy \f* in the way that Christ thinks about them,
