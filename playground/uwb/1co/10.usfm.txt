\c 10  
\s 1 Corinthians 10:1-5 
\s Our Jewish ancestors all experienced God's power, but almost all of them died in the desert because they sinned against him.
\p
\v 1 My fellow believers, I want to remind you that all our \add Jewish\add* ancestors were under the cloud
\add by which God miraculously led them and protected them when they left Egypt with
Moses\add*. All those ancestors crossed the Red Sea \add after God miraculously made the water separate so that they could walk
through it\add*. 
\v 2 God caused all of them to begin to live under the authority of \f + \ft metonymy \f* Moses
\add when they walked\add* under that cloud and \add walked through the
Red\add* Sea. 
\v 3 All \add those ancestors of ours ate the same food that God\add* miraculously
\add provided\add*. 
\v 4 They all drank water that \add God\add* miraculously\add provided\add*. That is, they all drank water that God
miraculously made come out of the rock. That rock was \add a symbol
of\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* Christ, who went with them. \add So we conclude that God helped all of those people in many
ways\add*. 
\v 5 However, \add we also conclude that\add* God was angry \f + \ft litotes \f* with most of those people
\add because they sinned against him. He caused almost all of them to die, and
as\add* a result their bodies were scattered in the desert. 
\s 1 Corinthians 10:6-13 
\s What happened to our Jewish ancestors was a warning of what will happen to us if we give in to temptation.
\p
\v 6 Those things \add that happened long ago\add* became examples to teach us
\add the following things\add*: We should not desire to \add do\add* evil things as those people desired to do.
\v 7 We should not worship idols as many of those people did. \add Remember that
Moses\add* wrote, "The people sat down. They ate and drank\add to honor the golden calf that they had just
made\add*. Then they got up to dance \add immorally\add*." 
\v 8 We should not have sexual relations with someone to whom we are not married, as many of them did. As a result, God
\add punished them by\add* causing twenty-three thousand people to die in
\add only\add* one day. 
\v 9 We should not try to see how much we can sin without the Lord punishing us. Some of them did that, and as a result they
died because \add poisonous\add* snakes \add bit them\add*. 
\v 10 We should not complain \add about what God does\add*. Some of them did that, and as a result an angel destroyed them.
\add So God will certainly punish us if we sin like they did\add*.
\p
\v 11 All those things \add that happened to our ancestors long ago\add* are examples for us.
\add Moses\add* wrote those things to warn us \add who are living
now\add*. We are the people for whom God has fulfilled \add the things that he purposed
in\add* the previous periods of time. 
\v 12 So \add I say this to\add* all those who confidently \add think that they will
always\add* steadfastly continue to \add believe what God said and will never disobey what he
commanded\add*: Be careful that you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* do not sin \add when you are
tempted\add*. 
\v 13  \add Remember that\add* your desires to sin are the same desires that other people have. But when you are tempted to
sin, you can trust God \add to help you\add*. He will not permit you to be tempted {anything to tempt you} more than you are
able to resist. Instead, when you are tempted {things tempt you}, he will also provide a way
\add for you\add* to endure it \add without sinning\add*. 
\s 1 Corinthians 10:14-22 
\s God will punish us if we participate in demon worship by eating food sacrificed to demons when we eat the Lord's Supper.
\p
\v 14 So, \add I say to\add* you people whom I love, \add avoid\add* worshipping idols
\add just like you would\add* run away from \add anything that is
dangerous\add*. 
\v 15 It is to people who \add think that they\add* are wise that I write. So, you, as wise people, judge whether what I am
writing \add is true\add*. 
\v 16  \add During the Lord's Supper, after we ask God to\add* bless the
\add wine\add*\f + \ft Or: the \add grape juice\add* \f* \add in the\add* cup, we give thanks for it
\add and drink it\add*. By doing that, we certainly are \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* sharing in what Christ
\add did for us when\add* his blood \add flowed from his body when he died. During the Lord's Supper, when we
break\add* the bread\add and eat it\add*, we are certainly sharing in \f + \ft metonymy \f* what Christ
\add did for us when\add* his body \add suffered for us on the cross\add*.\f + \ft Or: are we not sharing in ( metonymy ) what Christ
\add did for us when\add* his body \add suffered for us on the cross?\add* \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 17 Because it is one loaf of bread that we \add break and eat during the Lord's Supper, it symbolizes
that\add* we who are many are one group, because we all eat from the one loaf.
\p
\v 18 Consider \add what happens when\add* the Israelite people \add eat the food that the
priests\add* sacrifice on the altar \add outside the Temple\add*. They participate in
\add what the priests do at\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* the altar.\f + \ft Or: Are they not participating in
\add what the priests do at\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* the altar? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add Similarly, if you eat food that non-believers have offered to an
idol in a temple, you are participating in their worship of the idol
there\add*. 
\v 19 By saying that, \add I\add* do not mean that offering food to an idol makes it anything
\add more than just ordinary food.\f + \ft Or: do I mean\add* that offering food to an idol makes it anything
\add more than just ordinary food\add*? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* I do not mean that an idol is anything
\add more than just an idol\add*. 
\v 20 No! Instead, I mean that what people sacrifice \add to idols\add*, they are sacrificing to demons, not to God. So,
\add if you eat food that has been sacrificed to idols, you are participating in worshipping the demons that the idols
represent\add*. And I do not want you to participate in worshipping demons!
\v 21 When you drink the \add grape juice\f + \ft Or: wine \f* in\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* the cup
\add at the Lord's Supper\add*, you cannot participate in the \add blessings
that\add* the Lord \add Jesus\add* brought to us and at the same time drink the
\add wine in the\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* cup that people offer to demons! When you eat at the Lord's table, you cannot participate in the
blessings the Lord provided \f + \ft metonymy \f* when he died for us and at the same time participate in the things that represent demons
\add by eating food that has been sacrificed to idols\add*! 
\v 22  \add If you participate in honoring demons in that way\add*, you will certainly make the Lord very angry.\f + \ft Or: will not you
make the Lord very angry? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* Remember that you are certainly not stronger than he is.\f + \ft Or: Do you think that you are stronger
than he is? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add Certainly not, so you will not escape his punishing you if you honor demons in that
way!\add* 
\s 1 Corinthians 10:23-11:1 
\s It is all right to eat food offered to idols, but we should not do so if it would offend those who think that it is wrong.
\p
\v 23  \add Some people say\add*, "\add God\add* permits \add believers to
do\add* anything." But \add I say that\add* not everything that people do benefits
\add those who do it! Yes, some people say\add*, "God permits \add believers to
do\add* all things." But not everything that people do helps them to become
\add spiritually\add* mature. 
\v 24 No one should try to benefit \add only\add* himself. Instead, each person should try to benefit other people
\add spiritually\add*. 
\v 25  \add This is what you should do\add*: Eat any \add food\add* that is sold {that people sell} in the market. Do not ask
questions \add to find out if that food has been offered\add* {\add someone offered that
food\add*} \add to idols, just\add* because you think it would be wrong
\add to eat such food\add*. 
\v 26  \add Remember that the Psalmist wrote\add*, "Everything on the earth belongs to
\add the\add* Lord \add God because he created it!\add*" \add So, food that has been offered to idols belongs to the Lord, not
to the idols, and you may eat it\add*. 
\v 27 If a non-believer invites you to a meal, go if you want to, and eat any food that is set {that
\add he\add* sets} before you. Do not ask \add whether it was offered to idols,
just\add* because you think that it would be wrong \add to eat such
food\add*. 
\v 28 But if someone says to you, "This is food that was sacrificed
\add to an idol\add*," do not eat it, for the sake of the person who told that to you, and also because someone may think that
it is wrong \add to eat such food\add*. 
\v 29 I do not mean that you \add should be concerned about whether it is all right to eat such
food\add*. What I mean is that you should be concerned about others who may think that it is wrong to eat such food. Since I
know that I am free\f + \ft Or: have the right \f* \add to eat such food without God punishing
me\add*, no one should \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* say that what I am doing is wrong just because he himself thinks that it is wrong.
\v 30 If I thank \add God\add* for the food when I eat \add food that has been offered to an
idol\add*, no one should criticize me for eating food for which I have thanked God \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*!
\p
\v 31 So \add I say to you in conclusion\add*, when you eat \add food\add*, or drink
\add something\add*, or do anything else, do everything in order that
\add people will\add* praise God. 
\v 32 Do not do anything that would hinder Jews or Greeks \add from becoming
believers\add*, and do not do things that would encourage members of God's congregations to sin.
\v 33  \add Do as I do\add*. I try to please everyone in every way. I do this by not seeking to benefit myself. Instead, I try
to benefit many others, in order that they may be saved {that \add God\add* may save them}
\add from the guilt of their sins\add*.
