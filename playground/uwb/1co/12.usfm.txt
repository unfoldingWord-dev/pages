\c 12  
\s 1 Corinthians 12:1-3 
\s It is only God's Spirit who enables people to say that Jesus is Lord.
\p
\v 1 Now, my fellow believers, \add I will answer what you asked\add* about the things God's Spirit
\add enables believers to do\add*. I want you to know clearly \f + \ft litotes \f*
\add about these things\add*. 
\v 2 You know that before you became Christians, various things led you to
\add worship\add* idols, which are unable to tell you \add any of God's
message\add*. 
\v 3 So \add the first thing\add* that I will tell you now is that it is not the Spirit of God who would cause anyone to say,
“Jesus deserved to die,” and that the Holy Spirit is the only one who can enable anyone to say, “Jesus is
\add truly\add* the Lord.” 
\s 1 Corinthians 12:4-11 
\s God's Spirit gives believers special abilities as he desires.
\p
\v 4 There are various things \add that God's\add* Spirit enables
\add us believers to do\add*, but it is that same Spirit \add who enables all of us to do
them\add*. 
\v 5 There are many different ways to serve \add the Lord\add*, but it is the same Lord
\add whom we all are serving\add*. 
\v 6  \add We believers\add* have the power to do various \add tasks\add*, but it is the same God who gives all of us the power
\add to do\add* these things. 
\p
\v 7  \add God's\add* Spirit gives his power to each believer in order to benefit all the other
\add believers\add*. 
\v 8 To some, the Spirit gives the ability to speak very wise messages. To others, the same Spirit gives the ability to know
\add things that he reveals to them\add*. 
\v 9 To others, the same Spirit gives the ability to believe \add that God will work
miracles\add*. To others, the Spirit gives the ability to heal \add sick
people\add*. 
\v 10 To others, he gives the power \add to perform\add* miracles. To others, he gives the ability to speak messages that come
directly from God. To others, he gives the ability to tell \add if a message is really from God or
not\add*. To others he gives the ability to speak messages in languages \f + \ft metonymy \f*
\add that they have not learned\add*. To others, he gives the ability to tell the meaning of those messages \f + \ft metonymy \f*.
\v 11 It is the same one Spirit who gives all these abilities. He gives whatever abilities he wants to give, to whatever person
he wants to give them. 
\s 1 Corinthians 12:12-31 
\s A congregation needs all the abilities that God's Spirit gives to its members, but you should especially desire the ones
that help others the most. 
\p
\v 12 Although a person's body has many parts, all the parts form just one body \f + \ft doublet \f*. It is like that
\add with those who belong to\add* Christ. 
\v 13 When we were baptized {When people baptized us}, the one \add Holy\add* Spirit caused us to become one group
\add of believers\add*. It does not matter whether we are Jews or non-Jews. It does not matter whether we are slaves or not
slaves. \add When we believed in Christ\add*, the one Spirit came to live \f + \ft metaphor \f* within all of us.
\p
\v 14  \add Our\add* bodies do not have only one part. They have many parts
\add with various functions\add*. 
\v 15 If our foot could \add talk and\add* say \add to us\add*, “Because I am not
\add your\add* hand, I am not a part of \add your\add* body,” it would still be a part of
\add our\add* body. 
\v 16 If our ear could \add talk and\add* say, “Because I am not
\add your\add* eye, I am not a part of your body,” it would still be a part of our body.
\v 17 If our body were only an eye, we would not be able to hear.\f + \ft Or: how could we hear? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* If our body were only an ear, ◄we
would not be able to smell \add anything\add*!\f + \ft Or: how \f* could we smell
\add anything\add*?► \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* 
\v 18 But the truth is that God has put all the parts of our bodies together exactly as he wanted to put them.
\v 19 If \add our body\add* had only one part, it would not be a body.\f + \ft Or: how would it be a body? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 20 But the truth is that there are many parts \add in our body\add*, but it is still only one body.
\v 21 That is why if our eye \add could talk\add*, it should never say to our hand, “I do not need you!” And if our head
\add could talk\add*, it should not say to our feet, “I do not need you!”
\v 22 Instead, the parts of our body that seem to be weaker are the ones that are absolutely necessary.
\v 23 And the parts that we do not think highly of are the parts that we clothe carefully. And we protect carefully those parts
that we do not show to people. 
\v 24 The parts that are \add all right to\add* show people, we do not need to protect. Instead, God, who has put all the parts
of our bodies together, causes us to care for in a special way the parts that we think are less important.
\v 25 He does that in order that all the parts of our body will work together harmoniously \f + \ft litotes \f*, and so that all the parts
will care for all the other parts equally. 
\v 26 If one part of our body hurts, \add it is as though\add* all the parts of our body are hurting. If we pay special
attention to one part of our body, \add it is as though\add* all the parts of our body feel pleasure \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\p
\v 27  \add Everything I have just said about how the parts of our bodies relate to each other applies to
how\add* all of you who belong to Christ \add should relate to each
other\add*. Each of you belongs to him, \add but you have not all been given the same abilities and
work\add*. 
\v 28 God has placed apostles in our congregations. Apostles are first
\add in rank\add*. Next \add in rank\add* are those who speak messages which come directly from God. Next
\add in rank\add* are those who teach \add spiritual truth\add*. Then there are those who have the power to work miracles,
those who have the ability to heal \add sick people\add*, those who have the ability to help
\add others\add*, those who have the ability to govern \add the affairs of the
congregation\add*, and those who have the ability to speak \add messages\add* in languages \f + \ft metonymy \f*
\add that they have not learned\add*. 
\v 29 ◄Certainly not all \add believers\add* are apostles.\f + \ft Or: Are \f* all
\add believers\add* apostles?► \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* ◄They all do not have the ability to speak messages that come directly from God.\f + \ft Or: Do \f* they
all have the ability to speak messages that come directly from God?► \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* ◄They do not all have the ability to teach
\add spiritual truth\add*.\f + \ft Or: Do \f* they all have the ability to teach
\add spiritual truth\add*?► \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* ◄They do not all have the power to work miracles.\f + \ft Or: Do \f* they all have the power to work
miracles?► \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* 
\v 30 They do not all have the ability to heal people.\f + \ft Or: Do they all have the ability to heal people? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* ◄They do not all
have the ability to speak \add messages\add* in languages \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add they have not
learned\add*.\f + \ft Or: Do \f* they all have the ability to speak \add messages\add* in languages \f + \ft metonymy \f*
\add that they have not learned\add*?► \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* ◄They do not all have the ability to tell others the meaning of those messages.\f + \ft Or: Do \f*
they all have the ability to tell others the meaning of those messages?► \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\add Certainly not!\add* 
\v 31 But you should eagerly desire to have \add the abilities that will help other
believers\add* the most (OR\add , the abilities that God considers\add* to be the most important). But now I will tell you the
best way \add to use the abilities that God's Spirit has given you\add*.
