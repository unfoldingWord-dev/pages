\c 6  
\s 1 Corinthians 6:1-6 
\s It is disgusting that you prosecute fellow believers and let judges who are not believers decide your cases.
\p
\v 1  \add Now another matter:\add* When any of you\add believers\add* accuses another believer about some matter, he takes
that matter to judges who are not believers, \add for them to decide the
case\add*, instead of asking God's people \add to decide it\add*. ◄That is disgusting!/Why do you do that?► \f + \fk rhetorical question \f*
\v 2 ◄\add I want\add* you to know that \add we who are\add* God's people will
\add some day\add* judge those who are unbelievers./Do you not know that
\add we who are\add* God's people will \add some day\add* judge those who are unbelievers?► \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* So, since you will be judging
unbelievers, ◄you certainly are capable of judging between \add believers who disagree
on\add* small matters!/are you not you capable of judging between
\add believers who disagree on\add* small matters?► \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* 
\v 3 ◄You should keep in mind that we will even judge angels!/Do you not know that we will even judge angels?► \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* So we
certainly should be able to judge about \add matters that relate to how
we\add* conduct our lives here on earth! 
\v 4 Therefore, when you \add believers\add* have a dispute, ◄you should certainly not choose as judges
\add to decide your case\add* people whom the congregation cannot respect
\add because those judges are not believers!/\add*why do you choose as judges
\add to decide your case\add* people whom the congregation cannot respect
\add because those judges are not believers\add*?► \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* 
\v 5 I am saying this to make you ashamed. ◄Surely there is someone among you who is wise enough to judge disputes between
believers!/Is there no one among you who is wise enough to judge disputes between believers?► \f + \fk rhetorical question \f*
\v 6 But instead, some believers \add among you\add* accuse other believers in a legal court. And what is worse, you let the
cases be judged by unbelievers {unbelievers judge the cases}! 
\s 1 Corinthians 6:7-11 
\s God has freed you from your former sinful behavior, so remember that he will exclude from his kingdom those who engage in
all kinds of sinful behavior. 
\p
\v 7 The fact that you have any lawsuits among you \add shows that\add* you have completely failed
\add as Christians\add* \f + \ft (OR, \add allowed Satan to\add* defeat you) \f*. ◄You should
\add allow other believers\add* to wrong you \add without taking them to
court!\add*/Why do you not \add allow other believers\add* to wrong you
\add without taking them to court\add*?► \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* ◄You should not accuse them when
\add they\add* cheat you!/Why do you accuse them when \add they\add* cheat you?► \f + \fk rhetorical question \f*
\v 8 But\add what is happening is that\add* some of you are cheating others and doing wrong to them.
\add That is bad\add*. But you are doing that to fellow believers,
\add and that is worse!\add* 
\p
\v 9 ◄You should keep in mind that wicked people will not become
\add members of\add* the group over whom God will rule./Do you not know that wicked people will not become
\add members of\add* the group over whom God will rule?► \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* Do not be deceived {Do not deceive yourselves}
\add by thinking wrongly about these matters\add*. People who are sexually immoral, or who worship idols, or who ◄commit
adultery/have sex with someone to whom they are not married►, or who happily allow others to commit homosexual acts with them,
or who take the initiative in committing homosexual acts, 
\v 10 or who are thieves, or who desire and forcefully seize things that belong to others, or who are drunkards, or who slander
others, or who are swindlers, will not enter the place where God rules.
\v 11 Some of you previously did things like that. But \add God\add* has freed/cleansed you \f + \fk metaphor \f*
\add from your sinful behavior\add*. \add He\add* has set you apart for himself.
\add He\add* has erased the record of your sins \add because you
trusted\add* \f + \fk metonymy \f* in the Lord Jesus Christ and because of what the Spirit of our God
\add has done for you\add*. 
\s 1 Corinthians 6:12-20 
\s Because the Lord wants us to use our bodies in ways that please him, we must avoid all sexually immoral acts.
\p
\v 12  \add Some of you may say\add*, “God allows us to do anything
\add that he does not forbid\add*.” But \add I would reply\add*,
“\add That is true\add*, but not everything that God permits us to do helps us.”
\add Yes, as some of you say\add*, God permits us to do anything
\add that he does not forbid\add*. But as for me, I will not let anything make me
\add its slave; that is, I will not do anything that will gain control over me in such a way that I will not be able to stop
doing it\add*. 
\v 13  \add Some of you may also say\add*, “Food is just for \add us to put
in\add* the stomach, and the stomach is just for \add us to put\add* food
\add in\add*. And since God will do away with food and stomachs \add when he gives us our new bodies, what we do with our
bodies sexually does not affect us anymore than eating food does.” But what you have concluded is wrong,
because\add* the Lord does not \add want us to use\add* our bodies to do sexually immoral things. Instead, the Lord
\add wants us to use our bodies in ways that please him\add*. Also, the Lord
\add wants us to do what is good\add* for our bodies. 
\v 14 God, by his power, caused the Lord \add Jesus\add* to live again after he died, and he will cause us to live again after
we die, \add which shows that he is very concerned about our bodies\add*.
\p
\v 15 ◄You should keep in mind that your bodies belong to Christ./Do you not know that your bodies belong to Christ?► \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* So,
should I \add or any other believer\add* \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* take our body, which belongs to Christ, and join it
\add sexually\add* to a prostitute? No, certainly not! 
\v 16 When a man has sexual relations \f + \fk euphemism \f* with a prostitute, \add it is as
though\add* their two bodies become one body. ◄You should never forget that!/Do you not know that?► \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* What
\add Moses\add* wrote \add about people who join together sexually
is\add*, “The two of them will become \add as though they are\add* one body.”
\v 17 But anyone who is united {who joins himself} to the Lord becomes one with him spiritually.
\p
\v 18 Always ◄run away from/avoid► committing sexually immoral acts. Other sins that people commit do not affect their bodies,
but those who commit sexually immoral acts sin against their own bodies.
\v 19 ◄Keep in mind that your bodies are \add like\add* \f + \fk metaphor \f* temples of the Holy Spirit./Do you not know that your bodies are
\add like\add* \f + \fk metaphor \f* temples of the Holy Spirit?► \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* The Spirit, whom God gave you, lives within you. You do not belong to
yourselves. You belong to God, 
\v 20  \add because when his Son died for you it was as though\add* \f + \fk metaphor \f*
\add God\add* paid a price for you. So honor God by \add how you
use\add* your bodies!
