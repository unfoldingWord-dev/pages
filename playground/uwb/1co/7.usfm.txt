\c 7  
\s 1 Corinthians 7:1-7 
\s Married people should not deprive their spouses of sexual relations, except under special conditions.
\p
\v 1 Now \add I will reply to\add* the things that you wrote to me about.
\p It is good for people not to get married. 
\v 2 But because many people are committing sexual immorality, \add which God
detests\add*, every man should have his own wife \add with whom he can have sexual
relations\add*, and every woman should have her own husband \add with whom she can have sexual
relations\add*. 
\v 3 Every man must continue having sexual relations \f + \ft euphemism \f* with his wife, and every woman must continue having sexual relations
with her husband. 
\v 4 A man's wife does not have the right over her own body \add to be the only one to decide about having sexual relations
with her husband\add*. Instead, her husband also has a right \add to decide about
that\add*. Similarly, a woman's husband does not have the right over his own body
\add to be the only one to decide about having sexual relations with his
wife\add*. Instead, his wife also has a right \add to decide about
that\add*. 
\v 5 You may refuse \add to have sexual relations with\add* each other \f + \ft euphemism \f* only if you both first agree to do that for a
short time, in order that you may both have more time to pray. Then after that, begin having sexual relations again \f + \ft euphemism \f* in
order that Satan will not be able to persuade you \add to have sex with someone
else\add* because you are unable to control your sexual desires.
\p
\v 6 I am telling you these things to say that \add God\add* allows
\add you to get married, but he\add* does not say that you must \add get
married\add*. 
\v 7 I myself wish that all people would stay \add unmarried\f + \ft Or: single \f*\add*, as I am. But God has enabled each person to live in
different ways. He has enabled some people to \add live without getting
married\add*, and he has enabled other people to \add get married\add*.
\s 1 Corinthians 7:8-16 
\s It is all right to get married, but it is wrong to get divorced. However, you should not force an unbelieving spouse to keep
living with you. 
\p
\v 8 Now I want to say this to you unmarried people and to you whose spouses have died: It would be good for you to remain
\add unmarried\add* as I am. 
\v 9 But if you cannot control your \add sexual desires\add* \f + \ft euphemism \f*, you should get married. It is better to be married
\add so that you can satisfy your sexual desires with your spouse\add* than to constantly have a strong desire \f + \ft euphemism \f*
\add for sexual relations\add*. 
\p
\v 10 And now I will give a command for \add believers who are\add* married. This is not a command from me alone; it also comes
from the Lord Jesus. You married women must not separate from\f + \ft Or: divorce \f* your husbands!
\v 11 But if any of you do that, you must remain unmarried, or else you should be reconciled with your husband
\add and live with him again\add*. Similarly, men must not separate from\f + \ft Or: divorce \f* their wives.
\p
\v 12 Now I say this to the rest of you, \add to those who became believers after they were married. This is
what\add* I \add am saying\add*, not what the Lord \add has commanded\add*. If someone has a wife who is not a believer, if she
is willing to keep living with him, he must not divorce her. 
\v 13 Similarly, if a woman has a husband who is not a believer, if he is willing to keep living with her, she must not divorce
him. 
\v 14  \add I say that\add* because God has set apart every woman's unbelieving husband
\add for himself\add* because of his wife \add being a believer\add*, and God has set apart every man's unbelieving wife
\add for himself\add* because of her husband \add being a believer\add*. If that were not true,
\add God would consider\add* their children unacceptable. But, the fact is that
\add God does consider\add* them acceptable to him. 
\p
\v 15 However, if a woman's husband who is not a believer or a man's wife who is not a believer wants to leave, let
\add him or her\add* do so. If that happens, the husband or wife who is a believer should not force the other one to stay. God
has chosen us in order that we may live peacefully. 
\v 16  \add You women believers should allow your unbelieving spouses to leave you if they want
to\add*, because ◄there is no way that you can be sure that God will save your husband if you stay together.\f + \ft Or: how \f* can you be
sure that God will save your husband if you stay together?► \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \f + \ft Or: perhaps God will save your husband if you stay
together.) Similarly, you men \add who are believers\add*, there is no way that you can be sure that God will save your wives
if you stay together\f + \ft Or: how can you be sure that God will save your wives if you stay together? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* (OR, perhaps God will save
your wives if you stay together.) 
\s 1 Corinthians 7:17-24 
\s In general, each person should remain in the status that he had before he became a believer.
\p
\v 17 However, each person should continue in the status that the Lord gave him, the status that he had when the Lord called
him \add to belong to him\add*. That is the rule that I tell people in all the congregations
\add where I speak\add*. 
\v 18 If a man had already been circumcised \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* when he became a Christian, he should not
\add try to pretend that he is not\add* circumcised. If a man had not been circumcised \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* before he became a Christian, he
should not become circumcised. 
\v 19  \add You should not try to change your status that way\add*, because it means nothing
\add to God\add* whether someone is circumcised or not. What is important is that we obey what God has commanded.
\v 20  \add Generally\add*, each person should remain in the status that he had when he became a Christian.
\v 21 If one of you was a slave when you\add (sg)\add* became a Christian \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*, do not be concerned about it. However, if you
get an opportunity to be free, do \add what you need to do to become
free\add*! 
\v 22  \add Do not worry about your previously being a slave\add*, because those who were slaves before they became Christians,
the Lord has freed them \add from Satan's control\add*. Similarly, those who were not slaves before they became Christians,
\add it is as though\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* they are Christ's slaves \add because they must do what he tells them to
do\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. 
\v 23  \add Christ\add* paid a price to buy you \add when he died for
you\add*. So do not \add act as if you are evil people's\add* slaves
\add by doing the evil things that they tell you to do\add*. 
\v 24 My fellow believers, \add I repeat that in general\add* each believer, being in fellowship with God, should continue in
the status that he had before he became a Christian. 
\s 1 Corinthians 7:25-28 
\s It is not sinful to get married, but married people will have a lot of problems.
\p
\v 25 Now \add I will answer your question\add* about women who have never married. There is nothing that the Lord has
commanded me \add to write about them\add*, but I am writing this to tell you what I think
\add is best\add*, because the Lord \add Jesus\add* has mercifully enabled what I
\add say\add* to be reliable. 
\v 26 There are a lot of distressing events \add happening\add* now (OR, that will soon happen), so I think that it is better
for people to remain in the status that they now have. 
\v 27 If any of you \add men\add* are married \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*, do not try to divorce your wife. If any of you are unmarried \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*, do not
seek a wife. 
\v 28 But if \add any of\add* you \add men\add* get married, you have not committed a sin
\add by doing that\add*. Likewise, if an unmarried woman gets married, she has not committed a sin
\add by doing that\add*. However, those who get married will have many troubles,
\add so I am urging you to remain unmarried in order that\add* you may not experience
\add such troubles\add*. 
\s 1 Corinthians 7:29-31 
\s We believers should not devote our time to the affairs of this life.
\p
\v 29 My fellow believers, this is what I mean: There is not much time left
\add before Christ returns\add*. So, from now on those men who are married should
\add devote themselves to serving the Lord as much\add* as they would if they were not married.
\v 30 Those who are sad should \add devote themselves to serving the Lord as
much\add* as they would if they were not sad. Those who are rejoicing
\add should devote themselves to serving the Lord as much\add* as they would if they were not joyful.
\v 31 Those who are buying things should \add devote themselves to serving the Lord as
much\add* as they would if they did not possess those things. Because this world as it exists now will soon be gone, those who
are actively involved in the affairs of this life \add should not devote all their
time\add* to be involved in those things. 
\s 1 Corinthians 7:32-35 
\s It is better to remain unmarried because married people are more concerned about pleasing their spouses than about how to
please the Lord. 
\p
\v 32  \add Another reason why\add* I \add encourage you to remain unmarried is
that\add* I desire that none of you be anxious \add about the everyday affairs of this
life\add*. Unmarried men are \add able to be primarily\add* concerned about serving the Lord Jesus and trying to please him.
\v 33 But married men are \add often\add* greatly concerned about the affairs of this life. Specifically, they are concerned
about pleasing their wives. 
\v 34 So their thinking is divided. Unmarried women are \add able to
be\add* concerned about serving the Lord. They want to set apart their minds and their bodies for the Lord. But married women
are \add often\add* concerned about the affairs of this life. Specifically, they are concerned about how to please their
husbands. 
\v 35 I am telling you this for your own good. I am not saying it in order to restrict you. Instead, I am saying it in order
that you may do what is proper and be able to serve the Lord without being distracted {things distracting you}.
\s 1 Corinthians 7:36-38 
\s It is better for a man to decide that his daughter should remain unmarried than that she should get married, but either
decision is all right. 
\p
\v 36  \add Some of you men have asked about your unmarried daughters\add*.
\add I suggest that\add* if any man thinks that he may be treating his daughter unfairly
\add by keeping her from marrying\add*, and if it is already past
\add the right\add* time for her to get married, and if he thinks that she ought to be married, he should do what he wants to
do. He should let her get married. He will not be sinning \add by doing
that\add*. 
\v 37 But if a man feels absolutely sure \add that it is better that his daughter not get
married\add*, and if nothing is forcing \add her to get married\add*, and if he is free to do what he decides to do on the
matter, if he decides that his daughter should not get married, he is doing what is right in
\add keeping her from marrying\add*. 
\v 38 So any man who decides that his daughter should get married is doing what is good, but if he decides that she should not
get married, he is doing something even better. (OR, \vp 36\vp* \add Some of you men have asked about the women to whom you are
engaged to marry\add*. If any man thinks that he may be treating that woman unfairly
\add by not marrying her\add*, and if it is already past \add the
right\add* time for her to get married, and if he wants to marry her very much, he should do what he wants to do. He should
marry her. He will not be sinning \add by doing that\add*. \vp 37\vp* But if a man feels absolutely sure
\add that it is better\add* for him not to get married, and if nothing is forcing
\add them to get married\add*, if he is free to make his own decision on the matter, if he decides not to get married, he is
doing what is right. \vp 38\vp* So any man who decides that he should get married to the woman he is engaged to is doing what
is good, but if he decides that he should not get married, he is doing something even better. \f*
\s 1 Corinthians 7:39-40 
\s Women whose husbands have died are free to get remarried, but only to believers. However, they will probably remain happier
if they do not marry again. 
\p
\v 39 Women must remain married to their husbands while their husbands are still alive. But if a woman's husband dies, she is
free to marry any \add unmarried\add* man whom she wants to marry, but he must belong to the Lord.
\v 40 However, I think that she will be happier if she does not marry again. And I believe that the Spirit of God is
\add directing\add* me \add as I say that\add*.
