\c 9  
\s 1 Corinthians 9:1-2 
\s As your apostle I am free to do anything that God allows me to do.
\p
\v 1 ◄I am certainly free \add to do all the things that God allows me to do./Do you not think
that\add* I am free \add to do all the things God allows me to do\add*?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* ◄I am an
apostle./\add Do you not know\add* I am an apostle?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* \add ◄You\add*
certainly\add know that\add* I have seen Jesus our Lord./Have not
\add I told you that\add* I have seen Jesus our Lord?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* ◄It is a result of my work that you
\add have believed in\add* the Lord \add Jesus\add*./Isn't it a result of my work that you
\add have believed in\add* the Lord \add Jesus\add*?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* 
\v 2 And even though other people may think that I am not an apostle, you certainly should know that I am an apostle.
\add Remember that\add* your having become Christians \f + \fr metaphor \f* \add as a result of my telling you
about\add* the Lord ◄confirms/shows that it is true► that I am an apostle.
\s 1 Corinthians 9:3-7 
\s Barnabas and I have the same right to receive financial support that the other apostles have.
\p
\v 3 In order to defend myself, this \add is what I say\add* to those who criticize me
\add by claiming that I do not act like an apostle\add*. 
\v 4 As for Barnabas and me, ◄we certainly have the right \add as
apostles\add* to receive \add from you and other congregations\add* food and drink
\add for our work\add*./do we not have the right to receive \add from you and other
congregations\add* food and drink \add for our work\add*?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*
\v 5  \add We have the\add* same right\add that\add* the other apostles and the Lord Jesus'
\add younger\add* brothers and \add especially\add* Peter have. They all take along a wife who is a believer
\add when they travel various places in order to tell people about Christ. And they have a right that the people whom they work
among will support their wives, too\add*. So ◄Barnabas and I certainly have those same rights./do not Barnabas and I have those
same rights?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* 
\v 6 ◄It would be ridiculous to think that Barnabas and I are the only apostles who must work to earn money to pay our expenses
\add while we are doing God's work!/Do you think that\add* Barnabas and I are the only apostles who must work to earn money to
pay our expenses \add while we are doing God's work\add*?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*
\v 7 ◄Soldiers certainly do not pay their own wages./Do soldiers pay their own wages?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* ◄Those who plant a vineyard would
certainly eat some of the grapes \add when they become ripe\add*./Do not those who plant a vineyard eat some of the grapes
\add when they become ripe\add*?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* ◄Those who care for sheep would certainly drink the milk from those sheep./Do not those
who care for sheep drink the milk from those sheep?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* \add Similarly, those who tell others about Christ certainly have a
right to receive\add* ◄\add financial help/food\add*► \add from the people to whom they
preach\add*. 
\s 1 Corinthians 9:8-18 
\s God's servants have always had the right to receive financial help from others, but we have not insisted on that right
because we want to preach the gospel without charge. 
\p
\v 8 ◄I am saying that, not only because people think that it is right./Am I saying that only because people think that it is
right?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* \add No\add*, I am \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* saying it because it is what
\add God said\add* in the laws \add that he gave to Moses\add*. 
\v 9 Moses wrote in one of those laws, “While an ox is threshing\add grain\add*, you must not tie its mouth shut
\add so that it cannot eat the grain\add*.” ◄God was not only concerned about oxen
\add when he gave that law\add*./Was God \add only\add* concerned about oxen
\add when he gave that law\add*?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* 
\v 10  \add No\add*, he was \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* concerned about us, also! Yes,
\add God caused Moses to\add* write those words \add because he is
concerned\add* about us! Those who plow the ground confidently expect
\add to eat some of\add* the crop \add that grows\add*. Those who thresh grain confidently expect
\add to eat some of the grain that they thresh. Similarly, we who proclaim the message about Christ have the right to
confidently expect to receive financial help for our work\add*. 
\v 11 And because we have proclaimed God's message to you, ◄we certainly have the right to receive from you the things that we
need for our bodies \f + \fr metaphor \f*!/do we not have the right to receive from you the things that we need for our bodies?► [MET, RHQ]
\v 12 Since other people \add who preached to you\add* had that right, ◄certainly Barnabas and I have the same right./do
Barnabas and I not have the same right?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* 
\p However, neither of us insisted \add that you give us the things
that\add* we have a right \add to receive from you\add*. Instead, we were willing to endure anything in order that we not
hinder \add anyone from believing\add* the message about Christ.
\v 13 ◄You should keep in mind that \add the priests and servants\add* in the Temple eat
\add some of the food that people bring to\add* the Temple./Do you not know that
\add the priests and servants\add* in the Temple eat \add some of the food that people bring
to\add* the Temple?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* Specifically, the priests who work at the altar eat some of
\add the food that the people bring to sacrifice on\add* the altar.
\v 14 So the Lord has commanded that those who proclaim the good message
\add about him\add* should receive from \add those who hear that\add* message what they need to live on.
\p
\v 15 However, I have not requested that you \add give me\add* those things that I have a right
\add to receive from you\add*. Furthermore, I am writing this to you, not in order to request you to begin
\add giving me financial help now\add*. I would rather die than to
\add receive help from you\add*. I do not want anyone to prevent me from boasting
\add about my proclaiming God's message to you without receiving financial help from
you\add*. 
\v 16 When I proclaim the message about Christ, I cannot boast \add about doing
it\add*, because \add Christ\add* has commanded me \add to do it\add*. I would be very miserable \f + \fr (OR,
\add I am afraid that\add* God would punish me) \f* if I did not proclaim that message.
\v 17 If I had decided by myself to proclaim it, \add God\add* would reward me. But I did not decide by myself to do that. I am
simply doing the work that \add God\add* entrusted to me. 
\v 18 So ◄perhaps you wonder what my reward is./are you wondering what my reward is?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*
\add I will tell you\add*. When I proclaim the good message \add about
Christ\add*, I do not ask people for financial help. It \add makes me very happy not to ask for help, and being happy is
the\add* reward I get. I do not want to use the rights that I have
\add when I proclaim\add* the good message. 
\s 1 Corinthians 9:19-27 
\s I have adopted the code of conduct of whatever group I have been among, in order to bring more people to Christ.
\p
\v 19 I am not obligated to do what anyone else thinks that I should do. Nevertheless, when I have been with any group of
people, I have made myself \add do what they believed that I should do, just like a slave does what his master wants him to
do\add*. I have done that in order that I might convince more people
\add to trust in Christ\add*. 
\v 20 Specifically, when I was with fellow Jews, I did the things that Jews
\add think that people should do\add*. I did that in order that I might convince some of them
\add to trust in Christ\add*. Although I am now not obligated to obey the Jewish laws and rituals, when I was with those who
believe that they are obligated to obey those laws, I did the things that they
\add think that people should do\add*. I did that in order to convince some of them
\add to trust in Christ\add*. 
\v 21 When I was with ◄non-Jews/those who do not know those laws►, I did the things that non-Jews
\add think that people should do\add*, in order that I might convince some of them
\add to trust in Christ\add*. I do not mean that I disobey God's laws. No, I obey the things that Christ commanded us to do.
\v 22 When I was with those who doubt \add whether God will permit them to do certain things that
others\add* ◄\add disapprove of/think it is not right to do\add*►, I
\add avoided doing those things\add*, in order that I might convince some of them
\add to trust in Christ\add*. In summary, I have done all the things
\add that the people I have been with think that others should do\add*, in order that by every possible means I might convince
some of them \add to trust in Christ\add*. 
\v 23 I do all these things in order that \add more people will believe\add* the message about Christ, and in order that I,
along with other believers, may receive the good things \add that God promises to give
us\add*. 
\p
\v 24 When people run in a race, they all run, but only one of them wins the race and as a result gets a prize. ◄You certainly
know that./Do you not know that?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* So, \add just like\add* runners
\add exert themselves fully to win a race\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f*, \add you should exert yourselves fully to do the things that God wants
you to do\add*, in order that you may receive the reward \add that God wants to give
you\add*. 
\v 25 All athletes exercise their bodies strenuously in many ways. They do that in order to receive a wreath
\add as a reward to wear on their heads\add*. Those wreaths fade, but we will receive a reward that will last forever \f + \fr litotes \f*.
\v 26 For that reason, I \add try hard to please God\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f*,
\add like a\add* runner who runs toward the goal \f + \fr litotes \f*. I \add try hard to accomplish what God wants me to accomplish,
like\add* a boxer tries hard to hit his opponent, not to miss hitting him.
\v 27 I beat my body \add to make it do what I want it to do\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f*,
\add as\add* slaves \add obey their masters\add*, in order that, after I have proclaimed
\add God's message\add* to others, he will not \add say that I do\add* not deserve to receive a reward.
