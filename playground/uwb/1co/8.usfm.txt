\c 8  
\s 1 Corinthians 8:1-3 
\s We should not be proud about knowing the truth about idols. 
\p
\v 1 Now \add I will answer what you asked\add* about \add us believers\add* eating meat that has been sacrificed to idols.
\add We know what some of you say, that God has enabled\add* all of
us\add to\add* know \add the truth about things such as idols. But often we
become\add* proud because we say that we know \add all those things\add*. But instead of being proud about what we know, we
should show that we love \add our fellow believers by helping them
to\add* become spiritually mature. 
\v 2 Those who think that they thoroughly know something do not yet know it as they should.
\v 3 But as for those who love God, they know that they belong to him.
\s 1 Corinthians 8:4-6 
\s There are many idols that people think are gods, but there is only one true God.
\p
\v 4 So \add I will tell you\add* about eating meat that people have sacrificed to idols. We know that it is true,
\add as you say\add*, that idols are not really alive. We also know that there is only one real God.
\v 5 It is true that there are gods whom people think live in the heavens or whom they think live on earth. Truly, there are
many beings that \add people\add* call gods, and whom \add they\add* call lords.
\v 6 But for us \add believers\add* there is only one real God. He is
\add our heavenly\add* Father who created everything. He is the one whom we
\add worship and serve\add*. Also, for us believers Jesus Christ is the one and only Lord. He is the one whom
\add God caused\add* to create everything. It is because of what he
\add has done\add* that we have \add spiritual\add* life. 
\s 1 Corinthians 8:7-13 
\s Do not eat meat offered to idols if that would encourage other believers to eat that food contrary to their conscience.
\p
\v 7 Nevertheless, some people do not understand \add that idols are not really
alive\add*. In the past, some among you who are believers now were accustomed to believing that idols
\add were really alive\add*. As a result, when they eat such meat
\add now\add*, they still think that it was sacrificed to an idol
\add that is alive\add*. They are not sure \add that God allows believers to eat meat that has been offered to
idols\add*. So, \add when they eat such meat\add*, they think that they have sinned.
\v 8 But God will not think more highly about us \add if we eat certain\add* foods, or if we do not eat
\add certain foods\add*. That is, we are not more acceptable to God if we do not eat certain foods, nor are we more acceptable
to him if we eat those foods. 
\v 9 However, be sure that you do not do anything that God allows you to do, if by doing that you would encourage any of
\add your fellow believers to do something that\add* they are not sure
\add God allows them to do\add*. As a result, you would be causing them to sin.
\v 10 For example, you know \add that idols are not really alive\add*. Suppose that in a temple
\add where they worship\add* idols you eat \add food that has been sacrificed to
idols\add*. Suppose that someone who is not sure whether God allows us to eat that food sees you eating it.
◄\add You\add* would be encouraging him to eat it, too./Wouldn't
\add you\add* be encouraging him to eat it, too?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* 
\v 11 As a result, you who know that \add idols are not really alive\add*, might cause that fellow believer, one for whom
Christ died, ◄to be ruined \add spiritually\add*/to stop believing
\add in Christ\add*►. 
\v 12 By sinning against your fellow believer by causing him to do something that he thinks God does not allow us to do,
\add it is as though\add* you are sinning against Christ himself!
\v 13 So if \add I, Paul, think that by\add* eating a certain food I might cause a fellow believer to be ruined spiritually, I
will never eat such food again. I do not want to cause any fellow believer ◄to be ruined spiritually/to stop believing in
Christ►. \add And you should\add* ◄\add do as I do/imitate my example\add*►.
