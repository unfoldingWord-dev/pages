\s 1 Corinthians 3:1-4 
\s I was unable to teach you difficult concepts, because you were controlled by your self-directed nature, as evidenced by your
quarreling about which leader to whom you are loyal. 
\p
\v 1 My fellow believers, \add when I was with you previously\add*, I was not able to teach you as
\add I would teach people who are controlled by the Holy\add* Spirit
{\add whom the Holy\add* Spirit\add controls\add*}. Instead, \add I had to teach you as I would
teach\add* people whom their self-directed nature controls. \add I taught very simple concepts to you who had recently
believed\add* in Christ, \add as a parent would speak very simple
words\add* to a baby. 
\v 2 I did not \add teach\add* you \add things that were difficult for you to understand, just like a woman does
not\add* give \add her baby\add* solid food \add that the baby cannot chew and
digest\add*. \add And just like a woman\add* ◄\add gives her baby milk/breast-feeds her
baby\add*►\add , I taught you simple spiritual concepts\add*, because at that time you were not able to understand difficult
things. And you are still not able to understand difficult concepts,
\v 3 because you are still controlled by your self-directed nature. Some of you are jealous and quarreling. ◄That shows that
your self-directed nature is controlling you!/Does not that prove your self-directed nature is controlling you?► \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* It shows
that \add you are acting like\add* unbelievers act. 
\v 4 By some of you saying, “I am \add loyal to\add* Paul,” and others saying, “I am
\add loyal to\add* Apollos,” ◄you show that \add you are acting like\add* unbelievers./does not it show that
\add you are acting like\add* unbelievers?► \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* 
\s 1 Corinthians 3:5-9a 
\s I preached the gospel to you first, and Apollos followed, but we are both serving God equally.
\p
\v 5  \add So what you really ought to think about\add* Apollos and me \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* is that we(dl) are merely men who serve God. As a
result of our \add telling you the message about Christ\add*, you trusted in him. Both of
us\add (dl)\add* are merely doing the work that the Lord appointed us to do.
\v 6 I was \add the first one who preached God's message to you. I was
like\add* \f + \fk metaphor \f* someone who plants seeds. \add Later\add*, Apollos
\add taught you more of God's message. That was like\add* \f + \fk metaphor \f* someone who waters plants
\add after they start to grow\add*. But it is God who \add enables people to grow spiritually, just like he is the one
who\add* causes \add plants\add* to grow. 
\v 7 So \add the person who first preaches God's message to people is not important, and the person who later teaches people
more of God's message is not important, just like\add* \f + \fk metaphor \f* it is not the person who plants
\add the seeds\add* or the person who waters \add the plants\add* who is important. Instead, it is God, who causes plants to
grow\add and who causes people to grow spiritually, who is important\add*.
\v 8 The person \add who first preaches God's message to people and the one who later teaches them more of God's
message\add* \f + \fk metaphor \f* both ◄are \add trying to reach the\add* same \add goal\add*/have the same
\add purpose\add*►. And \add God\add* will reward each of them according to how they served him.
\v 9 Remember that Apollos and I are both working together for God.
\add You do not belong to us\add*. Just like a field \add belongs to its owner, not to those who work in
it\add*, you belong to God, \add not to us who work for him\add*.
\s 1 Corinthians 3:9b-15 
\s Each one who teaches believers must examine what he is teaching them because God will reward him only if his teaching is
valuable and long-lasting. 
\p Also, a house belongs to its owner. \add It does not belong to the man who built it. Similarly, God is the one to whom you
belong\add*. 
\v 10  \add Just like\add* a skilled person puts a foundation in the ground
\add before he builds a house\add*, as a result of God kindly helping me \f + \fk metaphor \f*,
\add I was the first one who declared the message about Christ to you. And, just
like\add* others build a house on its foundation, there were \add others who later taught you more about
Christ\add*. But \add just like each person who builds a house\add* must be careful about what materials he uses to build it
\f + \fk metaphor \f*, each person \add who teaches God's truth must be careful about what he
teaches\add*. 
\v 11 Just like people can put in \add only\add* one foundation \add for a
house\add* \f + \fk metaphor \f*, \add there is only one message that we can give to people. That message is
about\add* Jesus Christ. 
\v 12 Furthermore, people can build a house on its foundation \add with materials that are valuable and do not burn easily,
such as\add* gold, silver, and expensive jewels. Or they could build a house with
\add materials that are not valuable and that burn easily, such as\add* wood, hay, and straw.
\v 13 Later it will become clear/evident what kind of material they used to build the house.
\add Similarly, when people teach others God's truth\add*, it will later become clear
\add what kind of things they taught\add*. \add God\add* will make that clear/evident at the time
\add when he judges us\add* \f + \fk metonymy \f*. 
\v 14 When a fire \add starts burning a house\add*, it becomes clear whether the builders used
\add materials in their\add* work \add that will burn, or materials that will not
burn\add*. Similarly \f + \fk metaphor \f*, when God judges us, it will be clear whether we taught others things that were long-lasting and
valuable or not. If \add the materials that are used to\add* build a house
\add are materials that\add* do not burn, the builder will receive a reward \f + \fk metaphor \f*.
\add Similarly, if we have taught others things that are valuable and long-lasting, God will give us a
reward\add*. 
\v 15 If \add the things that we have taught\add* are not valuable and long-lasting \f + \fk metaphor \f*,
\add we will not get a reward\add*. We will be saved {\add God\add* will save us}
\add from hell\add*, but \add that is all that we will get. We will be like a man
who\add* escapes from a fire \add without saving any of his possessions\add*.
\s 1 Corinthians 3:16-17 
\s God will destroy anyone who destroys the unity of a congregation.
\p
\v 16 ◄You need to remember that God \add is present among\add* you\add (pl) as he was present in
the\add* Temple \add in Jerusalem\add*./Do you not know that God
\add is present among\add* you\add (pl) as he was present in the\add* Temple
\add in Jerusalem\add*?► \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* God's Spirit lives within you. 
\v 17 So, \add just like\add* God will destroy anyone who tries to destroy his Temple,
\add he will destroy anyone who destroys the unity of a congregation. He will do
that\add* because \add he has set\add* you, \add his people, apart for himself, just like he
set\add* his Temple \add apart for himself\add*. 
\s 1 Corinthians 3:18-23 
\s Stop being proud about one Christian leader or another, because we are all just working for your benefit.
\p
\v 18 Some among you think that you are wise because unbelievers thought you were wise previously. Stop deceiving yourselves.
\add If you really want to be wise, by accepting what God considers to be
wise\add* you should \add be willing to let unbelievers consider that you
are\add* foolish \f + \fk irony \f*. 
\v 19 You should do that because things that unbelievers \add consider to
be\add* \f + \fk irony \f* wise, God considers to be foolish. \add We can learn
from\add* the Scriptures\add what God says about\add* that, 
\q Those who think that they are \f + \fk irony \f* wise, he messes up their plans by the mistakes they make!
\p
\v 20 And \add we can learn from\add* these words of Scripture, 
\q The Lord considers as useless the thoughts of \add humans who think that they
are\add* \f + \fk irony \f* wise. 
\p
\v 21 So stop boasting about \add how good one Christian leader is or how good another Christian leader
is\add*! All \add of us(exc) exist as leaders only to help\add* you!
\v 22 Specifically, do not boast about me, or about Apollos, or about Peter! Everything in the world exists to
\add benefit\add* you \add believers\add*. Whether you live or whether you die, the things that are happening now or the things
that will happen in the future, they are all to benefit you. 
\v 23  \add You should boast about\add* Christ, \add not about your leaders,
because\add* you belong to Christ, and Christ belongs to God.
