\c 14  
\s 1 Corinthians 14:1-25 
\s Speaking messages that come directly from God will help believers much more than speaking messages in unknown languages.
\p
\v 1 You must want to love others more \add than you want anything
else\add*. But you should \add also\add* eagerly desire the abilities that
\add God's\add* Spirit \add gives to believers\add*. And you should desire most of all to have the ability to speak messages
that come directly from God \f + \ft metonymy \f*. 
\v 2-3  \add I say that\add* because those who speak messages that come directly from God
\add are speaking in languages that they and the other believers in the congregation know, and
thus\add* they are able to strengthen them \add spiritually\add* and to encourage and comfort them. But those who speak in
languages \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add that they have not learned\add* are not speaking to people. Instead, they are
\add only\add* speaking to God. No one understands them. By \add the power\f + \ft Or: guidance \f* of
God's\add* Spirit \f + \ft Or: From within \add their own\add* spirit \f* they speak things that others do not know.
\v 4 Those who speak in languages \add that they have not learned\add* are receiving a blessing for themselves, but those who
speak messages that come directly from God are giving a blessing to
\add all the believers in\add* the congregation \add because they are speaking in a language that the congregation
knows\add*. 
\p
\v 5 I would like you all to have the ability to speak in languages \f + \ft metonymy \f*
\add you have not learned\add*. But I would like even more for you to have the ability to speak messages that come directly
from God. If people speak messages in a language that they have not learned, if there is no one there who can explain the
meaning, that situation is not as helpful to the congregation as speaking messages that come directly from God
\add in the language that the congregation knows\add*. 
\p
\v 6 My fellow believers, suppose that I came to you and spoke to you in a language that none of you knows
\add and I did not explain the meaning of what I told you\add*. Even if I told you something that God had revealed to me, or
told you some message that had come directly from him, or taught you something that you needed to know, that certainly would
not help you!\f + \ft Or: how would that help you? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* 
\v 7  \add It is like\add* lifeless \add musical instruments\add*, like flutes and harps for example. When they are played, if
the notes are not played {if \add those playing those instruments\add* do not play the notes} clearly, no one will know what
tune is being played {what tune they are playing}.\f + \ft Or: how will anyone know what tune is being played {what tune they are
playing}? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* 
\v 8 If someone playing the trumpet \add wants to signal that the soldiers should prepare to fight a
battle\add*, \add the soldiers\add* certainly will not get ready if
\add the call to battle\add* is not played {he does not play \add the call to
battle\add*} clearly.\f + \ft Or: how will \add the soldiers\add* get ready if
\add the call to battle\add* is not played {he does not play \add the call to
battle\add*} clearly? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* 
\v 9 It is the same with you! If you do not speak words that other people can understand, no one will know what you are
saying.\f + \ft Or: how will anyone know what you are saying? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add It will be as
though\add* you are just speaking to the air! 
\v 10 There are many different languages in the world, and all of them convey meaning \f + \ft litotes \f*
\add to the people who know those languages\add*. 
\v 11 But if we do not understand the language that others are speaking,
\add it will be as though\add* they are foreigners to us, and we will be foreigners to them.
\v 12 So \add I say this to\add* you: Because you are eager to have the abilities that God's Spirit gives, earnestly desire
those abilities that will do the most to help \add all the believers
in\add* the congregation. 
\p
\v 13 So, those who have the ability to speak in languages \f + \ft metonymy \f*
\add that they have not learned\add* should pray that \add God will give them the ability
to\add* explain the meaning of what they say. 
\v 14 If they pray in a language \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add that they have not learned\add*, their spirits are praying, but they are not using
their minds. 
\v 15 So I will tell you \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* what we should do. \add At times\add* we may pray,
\add using\add* only our spirits, \add in languages we have not learned. And at other
times\add* we should pray using our minds, \add thinking about the words that we are praying.
Similarly\add*, at times we may sing using only our spirits, using languages that we have not learned, and at other times we
should sing using our minds, \add thinking about the words that we are
singing\add*. 
\v 16 Suppose that any one of you praises God \f + \ft Or: thanks God for what he has done \f*, using only
your\add (sg)\add* spirit \add and not using your mind\add*. Maybe some people
\add will be present who\add* do not know about \add the abilities that God's Spirit gives to
believers\add*. Because they do not know what you are saying, after you thank God, they will not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* know when to say
"Amen!\f + \ft Or: I \f* agree!" 
\v 17 You may be thanking God very well, but you are not helping them.
\v 18 I thank God that I speak in languages \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add that I have not
learned\add* more than any of you do. 
\v 19 But during a worship service, \add in order that others will understand what I am
saying\add*, I would prefer to speak five words using my mind, in order that I may teach others, rather than to speak ten
thousand words in a language \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add that is not understood by the
congregation\add*. 
\p
\v 20 My fellow believers, stop being like little children in the way that you think
\add about these abilities that God's Spirit gives\add*. Instead, think about them in a mature way. If you really want to be
like little children, do as few wicked things as babies do! 
\v 21  \add When the Jews long ago refused to obey God, he warned them about what would happen when he allowed their enemies to
punish them\add*. In the Scriptures it is written {\add the prophet
Isaiah\add* wrote} what the Lord \add God\add* said \add about that\add*,
\q \add They didn't listen to prophets speaking their own language, so I will
send\add* people from foreign \add lands to attack\add* my people.
\q Those foreigners will speak languages that my people do not know \f + \ft doublet \f*.
\q \add In that way\add*, I will warn my people, 
\q but they will still not pay attention to what I say. 
\p
\v 22 If we speak in languages \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add that we have not learned\add*, unbelievers
\add who are there will realize that the Spirit of God is truly among
us\add*. That will warn them \add that they need to fear God\add*. But believers do not
\add need such a warning\add*. 
\v 23 Suppose during the worship service everyone started to speak in languages \f + \ft metonymy \f*
\add that they have not learned\add*. If unbelievers or people who do not know
\add about the abilities that God's Spirit gives to believers\add* come in
\add and hear that\add*, they will surely think that you are crazy.\f + \ft Or: will they not think that you are crazy? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 24 But if an unbeliever or someone who does not know \add about those
abilities\add* comes in while all of you believers are \add one by
one\add* speaking messages that come directly from God, everything that you
\add say\add* will show that person that he is a sinner and that
\add God\add* will punish him \add if he does not turn from his sinful
behavior\add*. 
\v 25 He will realize that \add God knows the evil things that he has done
that\add* other people do not know. Then he will kneel down and worship God and say, "God is truly among you!"
\s 1 Corinthians 14:26-40 
\s Believers should all be prepared to participate in an orderly way during worship services.
\p
\v 26 So, my fellow believers, I will tell you \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* what I think that you should be doing. When you come together
\add to worship God\add*, some of you may have a hymn to sing. Others may have something to teach
\add the congregation\add*. Others may have \add something to say that God
has\add* revealed to them. Others may give messages in languages
\add that they have not learned\add*. Others will explain the meaning of those messages. Make sure that all of these things
that you do will make the congregation become more mature spiritually.
\v 27  \add It is all right\add* if two people, or at the most three people, speak in languages \f + \ft metonymy \f*
\add that they have not learned\add*. But they must speak one at a time, and someone must explain the meaning of what the
others have said. 
\v 28 If \add those who want to speak in a language that they have not learned realize
that\add* there is no one \add there\add* who will be able to explain the meaning
\add of what they will say\add*, they should not speak in that language during the meeting. Instead, they should speak to God
by themselves, \add somewhere else\add*. 
\p
\v 29  \add During a meeting\add*, two or three people should speak messages that come directly from God, and others who are
there should think carefully about what those people have said. 
\v 30 If someone receives a new message directly from God while someone else is speaking, the one who is speaking should stop
speaking \add and let the other person tell what God has revealed to
him\add*. 
\v 31 You can all, one by one, speak messages that have come directly from God, in order that you can teach others and all be
encouraged {encourage everyone}. 
\v 32 Those who speak messages that come directly from God are in control of their own spirits,
\add so they can wait for their turn to speak\add*. 
\v 33 Remember that God does not desire that things be done in a disorderly
way\add during your worship services\add*. Instead, he desires that everything be done in an orderly way.
\p Just like it happens in all the other congregations of believers,
\v 34 the women should not be permitted {do not permit the women}
\add to interrupt the meeting by\add* asking \add questions\add*. They must keep quiet. They must be subject
\add to their husbands\add*. What Moses wrote \f + \ft personification \f* \add about how God created the first two
people\add* suggests \add that the women should do that\add*. 
\v 35 If they want to know \add more\add* about something \add that a speaker
said\add*, they should ask their husbands when they get home, for it is disgraceful for women to
\add interrupt a service by\add* asking \add such questions\add*.
\v 36  \add If you do not agree with these things that I have been telling
you\add*, remember that \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* the message from God did not first come from you
\add people in Corinth\add*. Also, you are not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* the only ones who have heard it!
\add Many others have heard it and accepted it, so you should act as the believers in other places
act\add*. 
\v 37 Those of you who think that you have the ability to speak messages that come directly from God, or think that you have
some other ability \add that God's\add* Spirit gives, should realize that the things that I have written about in this letter
are things that the Lord has commanded. 
\v 38 But if they are not willing to accept \add my authority\add*,
\add God\add* will not accept them \f + \ft Or: they will not be accepted
\add by the congregation\add* \f*. 
\p
\v 39 So, my fellow believers, be eager to speak messages that come directly from God, and do not prevent anyone from speaking
in a language \add that he has not learned\add*. 
\v 40 But make sure \add that\add* \bd everything\bd* that you do\add during the worship
services\add* is done in a proper and orderly way.
