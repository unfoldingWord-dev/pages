\c 15  
\s 1 Corinthians 15:1-11 
\s I was not worthy to become an apostle, but the Lord Jesus committed to me the message about his death and resurrection.
\p
\v 1 Now, my fellow believers, I want to remind you about the message about Christ that I preached to you. It is the message
that you received and that you have continued to trust firmly. 
\v 2 If you keep on firmly\add believing\add* this message that I preached to you, you will be saved
{\add God\add* will save you}. If you do not continue to believe it, your believing
\add in Christ\add* was ◄all for nothing\f + \ft Or: useless \f*►! 
\p
\v 3 The most important part of the message that I received \add from the Lord
Jesus\add*, and that I told you, was this: Christ died to \add take away the
guilt\add* of our sins, as the Scriptures \add said that he would
do\add*. 
\v 4 His \add body\add* was buried {They buried his \add body\add*}. On the third day
\add after that\add*, he was raised {\add God\add* caused him to become alive} again, as the Scriptures
\add said would happen\add*. 
\v 5 After that, \add Christ\add* was seen by {appeared to} Peter. Then he appeared to
\add ten of\add* the twelve \add apostles\add*. 
\v 6 Later he was seen by {appeared to} more than five hundred of our fellow believers. Most of those are still living, but
some of them have died \\f + \\ft euphemism \\f*. 
\v 7 Then he was seen by {appeared \add to\add*} \add his younger
brother\add* James, \add who became the leader of the congregation in
Jerusalem\add*. Then he appeared to all of the apostles. 
\v 8 Finally, he was seen by {appeared to} me, but I became an apostle in a way that was very unusual \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f*.
\v 9 The fact is, I \add consider that I\add* am the least important of the apostles. I do not deserve to be an apostle,
because I ◄persecuted God's groups of believers\f + \ft Or: caused \f* God's groups of believers to suffer►
\add everywhere I went\add*. 
\v 10 But it is because God acted kindly toward me in ways that I did not deserve that I became what I am now. And his acting
kindly toward me produced a great result \\f + \\ft litotes \\f*, which is that I worked harder
\add for Christ\add* than all the other apostles. But it was not that I
\add was working with my own ability\add*. Instead, God was helping me in a way I did not deserve.
\v 11 So it does not matter whether it was I \add who was preaching or whether it was the other apostles who were
preaching\add*. We all preached \add the same message\add*, and that message is what you believed.
\s 1 Corinthians 15:12-34 
\s Christ has truly risen from the dead, and he will some day raise all believers.
\p
\v 12 So now \add let me ask you this\add*: Since \add we\add* have all preached to you that Christ was raised again {that
\add God\add* caused Christ to become alive} after he died, ◄no one among you should be saying that
\add God\add* will not cause \add believers\add* to become alive again after they die!\f + \ft Or: why \f* do some of you say that
\add God\add* will not cause \add believers\add* to become alive again after they die?► \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f*
\v 13 If \add it is true that God\add* will not cause anyone to become alive again, that situation would mean that Christ was
not raised from the dead {\add he\add* did not cause Christ to become alive again}!
\v 14 And if Christ was not raised from the dead {if \add God\add* did not cause Christ to become alive again}, then what we
preached to you was useless, and your believing \add in Christ\add* is useless.
\v 15  \add If it is true that\add* no one will be raised from the dead
{\add that God\add* will not cause anyone to become alive again after he dies},
we\add (exc)\add* have been guilty of lying to you about God, because we told you that God caused Christ to become alive again.
\v 16 But if it were really true that no one who has died will raised {that
\add God will\add* not cause anyone who has died to become alive} again, then Christ was not raised
{\add he\add* did not cause Christ to become alive} again either!
\v 17 If it were true that Christ was not raised {that \add God\add* did not cause Christ to become alive} again after he died,
you have believed in Christ for nothing, \add because\add* God will still
\add punish\add* you for \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* your sins. 
\v 18 And those people who died \\f + \\ft euphemism \\f* \add while they were trusting\add* in Christ will go to hell.
\v 19 In this life \add many of us have suffered much for Christ\add* because we confidently expect
\add that he will reward us in heaven\add*. If we have confidently expected this in vain, people should pity us more than they
pity anyone else! 
\p
\v 20 But \add the truth is that\add* Christ has been raised from the dead {that
\add God\add* has caused Christ to live again after he had died}, and ◄that guarantees\f + \ft Or: because \f* of that, it is certain► \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f*
that he will also cause those \add believers\add* who have died \\f + \\ft euphemism \\f* to become alive again.
\v 21 What one man, \add Adam, did affects us all\add*. We all die. Similarly, what one
man—\add Christ\add*—did \add affects us(inc) all\add*: God will cause
\add all believers\add* to become alive again. 
\v 22 Because of what Adam did, all \add of us who are descended\add* from him die. Similarly, because of what
\add Christ did\add*, all of us who have a close relationship with him will be made
{\add God\add* will make all of us who have a close relationship with Christ} alive
\add after we die\add*. 
\v 23 But we must all take our turn. \add God raised\add* Christ first \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f*. And when Christ
returns\add , God will cause\add* those who belong to Christ to become alive again.
\v 24 Then, after Christ has destroyed all \\f + \\ft doublet \\f* the evil powers that oppose God,
\add the world\add* will end. Then Christ will give to God, his Father, his kingdom to completely rule over it.
\v 25 You must realize that Christ must rule over that kingdom until he has completely defeated \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* all his enemies.
\v 26 The last thing that \add he\add* will get rid of is death.
\add But he certainly will get rid of death, which is like\add* an enemy
\add to us\add*. 
\v 27  \add In the Scriptures the Psalmist wrote that\add* God will cause everything to be under Christ's
\add authority\add* \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f*. But it is clear that the word ‘everything’ here does not include God, because God is the one who
will cause everything to be under Christ's \add authority\add* \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f*.
\v 28 After everything is put under \add the authority of\add* God's Son, then he will put himself completely under
\add the authority of\add* God, the one who gave him that authority. Then God will be completely in control of everything
\\f + \\ft idiom \\f*, everywhere. 
\p
\v 29  \add Now think about this: Some among you\add* are being baptized \f + \ft (OR, are baptizing people) on behalf of those who died
\add before someone baptized them\add* (OR, who died \add before they became
believers\add*). If, \add as some people say, believers\add* will not be raised
\add from the dead\add* {\add God\add* will not cause \add believers\add* to become alive again}, ◄what is the value in those
people doing that?\f + \ft Or: there \f* is no value in those people doing that!► \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* If
\add God\add* will not cause any \add believers\add* to become alive again, ◄it is senseless to be baptized {baptize anyone} on
behalf of someone who has died.\f + \ft Or: why \f* would someone be baptized {baptize anyone} on behalf of someone who has died?► \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f*
\v 30 Furthermore, \add if God will not cause us believers to become alive
again\add*, it is \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* very foolish for me and the other apostles to be constantly
\add putting ourselves\add* in danger \add because we tell people God's good
message\add*! 
\v 31 My fellow believers, every day I \add am in danger of\add* being killed {people killing me}! That is as true as it is
that I am pleased with you because of your close relationship with Christ Jesus our Lord.
\v 32  \add If God will not cause us believers to become alive again after we
die\add*, ◄I will receive no benefit at all \add from having opposed those who attacked me so
strongly\add* in Ephesus \add city\add*.\f + \ft Or: what \f* will I gain \add from having opposed those who attacked me so
strongly\add* in Ephesus \add city\add*?► \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* They were \add fighting me
like\add* wild beasts! If we \add believers\add* will not be raised
\add from the dead\add* {If \add God\add* will not cause us \add believers\add* to live again}, we might as well say
\add as people often say\add*: “Tomorrow we are going to die, so we might as well enjoy now everything that we can. We might as
well feast and get drunk!” 
\v 33 Do not let \add yourselves be deceived by those who say that God will not cause believers to live
again\add* {Do not let \add people who say that God will not cause believers to live
again\add* deceive you}. If you associate with evil people \add who say such
things\add*, they will ◄influence you to do evil things\f + \ft Or: destroy \f* your good moral way of living►.
\v 34 Start thinking correctly again \add about these matters\add*, as you should, and
\add stop your sinful behavior which has resulted from\add* your wrong thinking.
\add I say that\add* because \add it seems that\add* some among you do not know God, and as a result
they\add have this wrong thinking\add*. I say that to make you ashamed.
\s 1 Corinthians 15:35-58 
\s In heaven we will have glorious indestructible bodies. 
\p
\v 35 But some of you are asking, “How will dead people be raised {How will
\add God\add* cause dead people to become alive} again? What kind of bodies will they have?”
\v 36  \add Anyone who asks such questions is\add* foolish. You \add know
that\add* a seed that is planted in the ground must completely change its form \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* before it sprouts.
\v 37 A seed, such as a wheat seed, is very different from the plant that sprouts from it.
\v 38 God gives everything that lives the form that he desires. He gives each seed its own form.
\v 39  \add Similarly\add*, people, animals, birds, and fish all have flesh, but each one has a different kind of flesh.
\v 40 Also, there are angelic beings in heaven (OR, stars and planets in the sky), and there are people with bodies on the
earth. The angelic beings (OR, stars and planets) are beautiful in one way, and people on earth are beautiful in a different
way. 
\v 41 The sun is bright in one way, and the moon is bright in a different way, and the stars are bright in a different way. And
even the various stars are different from each other in how bright they are.
\p
\v 42 And it is the same way \add with our bodies. The bodies that we will have when God causes
us\add* to live again after we die \add will not be the same as the bodies that we have
now\add* \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f*. \add The bodies that we have now\add* will die and decay.
\add The new bodies that we will have\add* will never die. 
\v 43 We despise \add the bodies that we have now\add*, before we die. But our
\add new bodies\add* will be glorious. The \add bodies that we have before we
die\add* are weak. But our new bodies will be strong. 
\v 44 The bodies that we have before we die are natural bodies. But
\add our new bodies\add* will be ones that \add God's\add* Spirit
◄\add controls\f + \ft Or: gives \f* us\add*►. Just like there are natural bodies, there are bodies that
\add God's\add* Spirit \add completely\add* controls (OR, makes alive).
\p
\v 45  \add In the Scriptures\add* it is written {we read} that \add when\add* the first man, Adam,
\add was created\add*, he became a living human being. \add Christ later also became a human
being\add*. But\add he is different from Adam, because he\add* became a person who gives us
\add spiritual\add* life. 
\v 46 But our bodies that God's Spirit ◄will completely control\f + \ft Or: will \f* give us► are not the first bodies that we have. We have
our natural bodies first. 
\v 47 The first man, \add Adam\add*, was created {\add God\add* created the first man, Adam} from the dust of the earth. But
\add Christ\add*, the one who came later, came from heaven. 
\v 48 Everyone on earth \add has a body\add* like the first man on the earth had. And in heaven,
\add everyone will have a body like Christ\add*, the man who came from heaven, has.
\v 49 And just like \add God\add* gave us bodies like the first man on earth had, so we
\add believers will have bodies\add* like \add Christ\add* has, who is now in heaven.
\p
\v 50 My fellow believers, I want you to know that we\add (inc) \f*\add* \\f + \\ft synecdoche \\f* cannot go
\add to heaven, where\add* God rules \add over everything\add*, with our physical bodies, because our bodies
\add cannot last forever\add*. They will die and decay. 
\v 51 But I will tell you something that \add God\add* has not revealed
\add before\add*: \add Some of\add* us \add believers\add* will not die \\f + \\ft euphemism \\f*. However, all of us will be changed
{\add God\add* will change all of us}. 
\v 52  \add It will happen\add* suddenly, as \add fast as someone
can\add* blink his eye \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f*, when \add we hear the sound of God's\add* trumpet for the last time. When we hear that trumpet,
all \add the believers\add* who have died will become alive and will have bodies that are changed {that
\add God\add* has changed}, bodies that will never decay. 
\v 53 And the \add bodies of us who are alive at that time\add* will
\add also\add* be changed {And \add God\add* will \add also\add* change the
\add bodies of us who are alive at that time\add*}. These bodies of ours that die and decay must be transformed into
\add new bodies that\add* will never die; \add it will be like someone\add* \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* getting rid of
\add his old clothes\add* and putting on \add new ones\add*. 
\v 54 When that happens, what is written {what ◄\add a prophet\f + \ft Or: Isaiah \f*\add*► wrote}
\add in the Scriptures\add* will come true\f + \ft Or: happen \f*, 
\p \add God\add* will completely get rid of \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* death. Our dying will no longer have any power to defeat us;
\v 55 Death \\f + \\ft apostrophe \\f* will not win a victory over us. Death will not be able to hurt us.
\p
\v 56 It is because we sin \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* \add that we die, and it is because
we\add* have God's laws that we \add know that we\add* have sinned.
\v 57 But because of what our Lord Jesus Christ \add has done\add*, he enables us to be free
\add from having to obey God's laws to be saved and to be free of being afraid to
die\add*. We should thank God for that! 
\p
\v 58 So, my fellow believers whom I love, continue to hold strongly to
\add the things that you believe\add*. Do not let anything cause you to doubt them. Always be doing enthusiastically the work
that the Lord \add gives you\add*. And remember that the work that you do for the Lord is never ◄in vain\f + \ft Or: useless \f*►,
\add as it would be if God will not cause us to live again after we
die\add*.
