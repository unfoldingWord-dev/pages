\p
\v 1  \add Follow my example\add*, just like I \add try to\add* follow Christ's example.
\s 1 Corinthians 11:2-16 
\s Women should wear a hair covering while praying or prophesying in a service, but men should not do so.
\p
\v 2 I praise you because you remember all the things \add that I taught
you\add* and because you follow the instructions that I gave you. You have done just like I told you to do.
\v 3  \add Now\add*, I want you to know that the one who has authority over \f + \fr metonymy \f* every man is Christ, and the ones who have
authority over women are men (OR, their husbands), and the one who has authority over Christ is God.
\v 4  \add So\add* if any man \add wears a covering over\add* his head when he prays or speaks a message God gave him, he
disgraces himself \f + \fr synecdoche \f*. 
\v 5 Also, if any woman does not wear a covering over her head when she prays or speaks a message that God gave her, she
disgraces herself (OR, she dishonors her husband). That would be acting like \f + \fr simile \f*
\add women who are ashamed because\add* their heads have been shaved.
\v 6 So, if women do not wear coverings over their heads \add when they pray or speak messages that God gave
them\add*, they should let someone shave their heads \add so that they will be
ashamed\add*. But since women are ashamed if someone cuts their hair
\add short\add* or shaves off their hair, they should wear coverings over their heads
\add when they pray or speak messages that God gave them\add*. 
\v 7 Men should not wear coverings over their heads \add when they pray or speak messages that God gave
them\add*, because they represent what God is like \f + \fr metaphor \f* and they show how great God is. But women show how great men (OR,
their husbands) are. 
\v 8  \add Remember that God intends that men have authority over women. We know
that\add* because \add God\add* did not make \add the first\add* man,
\add Adam\add*, from the \add first\add* woman, \add Eve\add*. Instead, he made that woman
\add from a bone that he took\add* from the man. 
\v 9 Also, \add God\add* did not create \add the first\add* man \add to
help\add* the woman. Instead, \add he\add* created the woman \add to
help\add* the man. 
\v 10 For that reason, women should wear something \add to cover\add* their heads
\add as a symbol of their being under their husbands'\add* \f + \fr metonymy \f* authority. They should also
\add cover their heads\add* so that the angels \add will see that and
rejoice\add*. 
\p
\v 11-12 However, remember that \add even though God created the
first\add* woman from \add the first\add* man, \add now\add* it is women who
\add give birth\add* to men. So men cannot be independent of women, nor can women be independent of men. But all things,
\add including men and women\add*, come from God. 
\v 13 Consider this for yourselves: Is it proper for \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* women to pray to God while they do not have coverings over their
heads? 
\v 14 ◄Everyone senses that it is disgraceful for men to have long hair./Do you not know naturally that it is disgraceful for
men to have long hair?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* 
\v 15 But it is very delightful if women have long hair, because
\add God\add* gave them long hair to be like a \add beautiful\add* covering
\add for their heads\add*. 
\v 16 But whoever wants to argue \add with me about my saying that women should have a covering over their heads when they pray
or speak a message from God should consider the fact that\add* we
\add apostles\add* do not \add permit\add* any other custom, and the
\add other\add* congregations of God do not have any other custom.
\s 1 Corinthians 11:17-22 
\s THEME When you gather to eat the Lord's Supper, you act selfishly. I cannot praise you for that.
\p
\v 17 Concerning the matters \add about which I will instruct you
now\add*, I do not praise you, because whenever you believers meet together, good
\add things do not happen\add*. Instead, bad things \add happen\add*.
\v 18 First of all, people have told me that when you gather together as a group
\add to worship God\add*, you divide into groups \add that are hostile to each
other\add*. To some extent I believe that is true. 
\v 19 It seems that you must divide into \add groups that despise each
other\add* in order that it might be clear/evident which people among you
\add God\add* approves of! 
\v 20 When you gather together, you \f + \fr irony \f* eat the meal \add that you say is to remember the death
of\add* the Lord \add Jesus for us\add*. 
\v 21 But \add what happens when\add* you eat is that each person eats his own meal before
\add he thinks about sharing his food with anyone else\add*. As a result,
\add when the meal is over\add*, some people are \add still\add* hungry and others are drunk!
\add So it is not a meal that honors the Lord\add*. 
\v 22 ◄\add You act as though\add* you do not have your own houses in which you can eat and drink
\add whatever you want to\add*!/Do you not have your own houses in which you can eat and drink
\add whatever you want to\add*?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* Do you not realize \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* \add that by acting selfishly in this
way\add*, it is God's people whom you are despising, and it is the poor people
\add in your group\add* whom you are treating as though they were not important? What shall I say to you about that \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*? Do
\add you expect\add* me to praise you\add about what you do\add* \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*? I certainly will not praise you!
\s 1 Corinthians 11:23-26 
\s The Lord gave us instructions about the significance of the Lord's Supper.
\p
\v 23 The Lord taught me these things that I also taught you: During the night that Jesus was betrayed
{\add Judas\add* enabled \add the enemies of\add* the Lord Jesus to seize him}, he took some bread.
\v 24 After he thanked God for it, he broke it into pieces. \add Then he gave it to his
disciples\add* and said, “This bread \add represents\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f* (OR, is) my body, that
\add I am about to sacrifice\add* for you. Eat bread in this \add way again and
again\add* to remember my \add offering myself as a sacrifice for
you\add*.” 
\v 25 Similarly, after they ate their meal, he took a cup \f + \fr metonymy \f* \add of
wine\add*. He \add thanked God for it. Then he gave it to his disciples\add*, saying,
“\add The wine in\add* \f + \fr metonymy \f* this cup \add represents\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f* (OR, is) my blood
\add that will flow from my body\add* ◄\add to put into effect/to
establish\add*► the new agreement \add that God is making with people\add*. Whenever you drink wine in this way, do it to
remember that \add my blood flowed for you\add*.” 
\v 26  \add Remember that\add* until the Lord \add Jesus\add* returns
\add to the earth\add*, whenever you eat the \add bread that represents his
body\add* and drink the wine \f + \fr metonymy \f* \add that represents his blood\add*, you are telling other people that he died
\add for you\add*. 
\s 1 Corinthians 11:27-34 
\s God punishes those who eat the Lord's Supper in a way that does not express the unity of his people.
\p
\v 27 So, those who eat that bread and drink that wine \f + \fr metonymy \f* in a way that is not proper
\add for those who belong to the Lord\add* are guilty of \add acting in a way that is contrary to
what\add* our \add Lord intended when he offered\add* his body \add as a
sacrifice\add* and his blood \add flowed when he died\add*. 
\v 28 Before any believer eats that bread and drinks that wine \f + \fr metonymy \f*, he should think carefully about
\add what he is doing\add*, 
\v 29 because if anyone eats \add the bread that represents Christ's
body\add* and drinks \add the wine that represents his blood\add* without recognizing that all God's
\add people should be united, God will\add* punish him \add for doing
that\add*. 
\v 30 Many people in your group are weak and sick, and several have died \f + \fr euphemism \f* because of
\add the way they acted when they ate that bread and drank that wine\add*.
\v 31 If we would think carefully about what we \add are doing\add*,
\add God\add* would not judge \add and punish\add* us \add like that\add*.
\v 32 But when the Lord judges \add and punishes\add* us \add for acting
wrongly\add*, he disciplines us \add to correct us\add*, in order that he will not
\add need to\add* punish us when he punishes \add the people who do not trust in
Christ\add* \f + \fr metonymy \f*. 
\p
\v 33 So, my fellow believers, when you gather together to eat \add food to remember the Lord's dying for
you\add*, wait until everyone \add has arrived so that you can find out who does not have enough
food\add*. 
\v 34 Those who are so hungry \add that they cannot wait to eat until everyone else has
arrived\add* should eat in their own homes \add first\add*, in order that when you gather together God will not judge
\add and punish them for\add* ◄\add being inconsiderate of/not being concerned
about\add*► \add others\add*. 
\p And when I come \add to Corinth\add* I will give you instructions about other matters
\add concerning the Lord's Supper\add*.
