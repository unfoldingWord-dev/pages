\c 13  
\s 1 Corinthians 13:1-13 
\s We should use the abilities that God's Spirit has given us in ways that show that we love others.
\p
\v 1 If we could speak \add all\add* the various languages \f + \fr metonymy \f* that people
\add in the world speak\add* and even speak \add the language\add* that angels
\add speak\add*, if we did not love \add others, speaking those languages\add* would be
\add as useless as beating\add* a brass gong or clanging cymbals
\add together\add*. 
\v 2 If we had the ability to speak messages that come directly from God, and if we could understand the plans that he has not
yet revealed \add to others\add*, and if we could know everything
\add about everything\add*, and if we believed in God so strongly that we could
\add do impossible things like\add* causing mountains to move, if we did not love
\add others, God would consider all that\add* to be worthless. 
\v 3 If we would give everything that we own to poor people, and if we would let others kill us in order that we could boast
about \add sacrificing our\add* own bodies, if we did not love \add others\add*, we would not get any reward
\add from God\add*. 
\p
\v 4 Those who \f + \fr personification \f* truly love \add others\add* act patiently and kindly toward them. Those who \f + \fr personification \f* truly love
\add others\add* are not jealous of them, they do not boast \add about what they themselves have
done\add*, and are not proud. 
\v 5 Those who \f + \fr personification \f* truly love \add others\add* do not act in disgraceful/disrespectful ways towards them. They do not ◄act
selfishly/think only of themselves and what they want►. They do not quickly become angry. They do not keep remembering the bad
things \add that others have done to them\add*. 
\v 6 Those who \f + \fr personification \f* truly love \add others\add* do not rejoice when
\add people do\add* evil things, but they do rejoice when \add people
act\add* righteously. 
\v 7 Those who truly love \add others\add* patiently endure \add the faults of
others\add*. They do not quickly assume \add that others have done something
bad\add*. They confidently expect \add that others will act righteously\add*. They patiently endure
\add all their own troubles\add*. 
\p
\v 8 We should never \f + \fr personification \f* let anything stop us from continuing to love
\add others\add*. As for the ability to speak messages that come directly from God, some day that will come to an end. As for
the ability to speak languages \f + \fr metonymy \f* \add that we have not learned\add*, that will
\add also\add* come to an end some day. And as for the ability to know things that God reveals to us, that will come to an end
some day \add because it will not be necessary anymore\add*. 
\v 9 God does not reveal everything to us, and we cannot know everything that he knows.
\v 10 But when everything is perfect \add after Christ returns\add*, things which are not perfect
\add now\add*, \add such as the abilities which God's Spirit gives
us\add*, will ◄be abolished/come to an end►. 
\v 11 When we were children, we talked like children talk, we thought like children think, we reasoned like children reason.
But when we grew up, we got rid of our childish ways \f + \fr metaphor \f*. \add Similarly\add*,
\add you need to get rid of your childish thinking about the abilities that the Spirit has given
you\add*. 
\v 12 In this life we do not understand everything fully. It is like \f + \fr metaphor \f* looking at something indirectly by seeing it in a
mirror. But \add when we get to heaven\add* \f + \fr metonymy \f*, we will \add understand everything clearly. It will be
like\add* talking to someone face-to-face. Now we know only part
\add of everything that God wants us to know\add*. Then we will know everything completely, just like
\add God\add* knows us completely. 
\v 13 So now there are three things \add that we must\add* continue
\add to do\add*: To trust \add in God\add*, to confidently expect
\add to receive what he will give us\add*, and to love \add others\add*. But the greatest of those three things is loving
\add others\add*.
