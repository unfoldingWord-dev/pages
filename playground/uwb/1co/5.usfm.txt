\c 5  
\s 1 Corinthians 5:1-5 
\s You should expel the man in your congregation who has acted so immorally.
\p
\v 1  \add Now I want to discuss another matter\add*. It has been \f + \ft Or:People have \f* reported to me, and I believe that it is true,
that some people among you have been acting in a sexually immoral way, in a way that is so bad that not even pagans\f + \ft Or: people who
do not know about God \f* act that way. People tell me that a man is living with his stepmother \f + \ft Or: his father's other wife \f*.
\v 2 You should be sad about what that man is doing! He should have been expelled
\f + \ft Or:\add You\add* should have expelled him \f* from your congregation!
\add But you\add* have not\add done that\add*, so how can you be proud,
\add thinking that you are spiritually mature?\add*\f + \ft Or: it is disgusting that you are proud,
\add thinking that you are spiritually mature\add*! \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* 
\v 3 As for me, I have already decided \add how you should\add* punish that man. And even though I am away from you, my spirit
is with you, and you should do as I would do if I were there with you.
\v 4  \add What I have decided is that\add* when you have gathered together with the authority \f + \ft metonymy \f* of our Lord Jesus, and my
spirit is with you, and the power of our Lord Jesus \add is with
you\add*, 
\v 5 you should put that man into Satan's hands. Then Satan can injure\f + \ft Or: punish \f* his body, in order that
\add he will turn away from his sinful behavior\add* and his spirit will be saved on the day when the Lord
\add returns\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*. 
\s 1 Corinthians 5:6-8 
\s Make sure that no one in your congregation is acting immorally or maliciously or wickedly.
\p
\v 6 It is not good that, \add while you are letting that immoral man continue to be in your
congregation\add*, you are boasting \add about being spiritually
mature\add*. You know that a small amount of yeast affects all the bread dough \f + \ft metaphor \f*
\add into which it is put\add* \f + \ft Or:\add a woman puts it\add* \f*.\f + \ft Or: Do you not know that a small amount of yeast affects all the bread
dough ( metaphor ) \add into which it is put\add*? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add Similarly, one person who continues to sin will have a bad effect on
all the congregation\add*. 
\v 7 So, \add just like we Jews\add* expel the old yeast \add from our houses during the Passover
celebration\add* in order that we may have a fresh batch of dough without yeast in it \f + \ft metaphor \f*,
\add you must expel such evil people from your congregation\add*. Do
\add that so that you can truly be holy people\add*, as \add I know
that\add* you really are. Remember that Christ was sacrificed \f + \ft Or:sacrificed himself \f*
\add so that God could spare us from being punished for our sins, just like the Jews sacrificed lambs
during\add* the \add first\add* Passover celebration \add so that God would spare their firstborn sons from being
killed\add*. 
\v 8 So let us celebrate \add the fact that God has freed us from punishing us for our
sins\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add just like the Jews\add* in \add later years\add* celebrated Passover
\add to celebrate God freeing them from being slaves in Egypt. They made sure that there
was\add* no old yeast in the dough. \add They ate bread that\add* had no yeast in it.
\add Similarly\add*, \add we should make sure that there are no people in our
congregations\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add who act\add* maliciously \add toward
others\add* or \add act\add* wickedly. Instead, \add make sure\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*
\add that those in our congregations are ones who act\add* sincerely and
\add speak\add* truthfully. 
\s 1 Corinthians 5:9-13 
\s Expel wicked people from your congregation. 
\p
\v 9 In the previous letter that I wrote to you, I said that you should not associate with sexually immoral people.
\v 10 I did not mean that you should not associate with unbelievers who are immoral, or who desire things that belong to
others, or who forcefully seize things that belong to others\f + \ft Or: are swindlers \f*, or who worship idols. You would have to leave
this world \add to avoid all people\add* like that. 
\v 11 But now \add I am stating clearly that\add* when I wrote, I
\add meant that\add* you should not associate with those who say that they are fellow believers, if they are sexually immoral
or if they desire and forcefully seize things that belong to others, or worship idols, or slander others, or become drunk. You
should not associate with people like that, and you should not even eat with them!
\v 12 It is certainly not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* my business to judge people who are not believers and who do not belong to
\add Christian congregations\add*. But it certainly is \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* your business to judge those who are in
\add your congregation\add*. 
\v 13 God is the one who will judge those who are not believers\add . Do as the Scriptures
command:\add* "Expel the wicked person from your midst!"
