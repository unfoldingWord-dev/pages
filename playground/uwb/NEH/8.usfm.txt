\c 8  
\s Ezra read from the laws of Moses 
\p
\v 1-2 Ezra, who taught people the laws of Moses, \add had a scroll on
which\add* the laws of Moses were written. Those were the laws that Yahweh had commanded the Israeli people
\add to obey\add*. On October 8 of that year, all the people gathered together in the plaza/square that was close to the Water
Gate. Men and women and \add children who were old enough to\add* understand gathered together. Someone told Ezra to bring out
that scroll. 
\v 3 So he brought it out and read it to the people. He started reading it early in the morning and continued reading it until
noontime. All the people listened carefully to the laws that were written on the scroll.
\p
\v 4 Ezra stood on top of a high wooden platform that had been built just for that event. At his right side stood Mattithiah,
Shema, Anaiah, Uriah, Hilkiah, and Maaseiah. At his left side stood Pedaiah, Mishael, Malkijah, Hashum, Hashbaddanah,
Zechariah, and Meshullam. 
\p
\v 5 Ezra stood on the platform above the people, where they could all see him. He opened the scroll; and as he did that, all
the people stood up, \add and they continued to stand, to show respect for God's
word\add*. 
\v 6 Then Ezra praised Yahweh, the great God, and all the people lifted up their hands and said, “Amen! Amen!” Then they all
bowed down with their foreheads touching the ground, and they worshiped Yahweh.
\p
\v 7 Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, and Pelaiah, were
all ◄Levites/men who worked in the temple►. They explained the meaning of the laws of Moses to the people who were standing
there. 
\v 8 They also read from scrolls that contained the laws that God
\add gave to Moses\add*, and they interpreted \add into the Aramaic
language\add* what they read, making the meaning clear so that the people could understand the meaning.
\p
\v 9 Then Nehemiah the governor, and Ezra, and the Levites who were interpreting what was being read to the people, said to
them, “Yahweh your God considers that this day is very holy/sacred. So do not be sad or cry!” They said that because all the
people were crying as they were listening to the laws of Moses. 
\p
\v 10 Then Nehemiah said to them, “Now go home and enjoy some good food and some drink some sweet wine. And send some of it to
people who do not have anything \add to eat or drink\add*. This is a day that Yahweh considers sacred. Do not be sad! Yahweh
will cause you to be joyful and make you strong.” 
\p
\v 11 The Levites also caused the people to be quiet, saying “Be quiet
\add and do not cry\add*, because this is a sacred day! Do not be sad!”
\p
\v 12 So the people went away, and they ate and drank, and they sent portions of food
\add to those who did not have any\add*. They celebrated very joyfully, because they had heard and understood what had been
read to them. 
\p
\v 13 The next day, the leaders of the families and the priests and the Levites came together with Ezra to study carefully the
laws that Yahweh had given to Moses. 
\v 14 While they were doing that, they realized that Yahweh had told Moses to command the Israeli people to live in shelters
during that month, \add to remember that their ancestors lived in shelters when they left
Egypt\add*. 
\v 15 They also learned that they should proclaim in Jerusalem and in all the towns that the people should go to the hills and
cut branches from olive trees \add that they have planted\add* and from wild olive trees and from myrtle trees and palm trees
and fig trees. They should make shelters from these branches, and live in those shelters during the festival, just as Moses
wrote \add that they should do\add*. 
\p
\v 16 So the people went out \add of the city\add* and cut branches and used them to build shelters. They built shelters on the
\add flat\add* roofs \add of their houses\add*, in their courtyards, in the courtyards of the temple, in the plazas/squares
close to the Water Gate and the Ephraim Gate. 
\v 17 All of the Israeli people who had returned from Babylon built shelters and lived in them
\add for one week\add*. The Israeli people had not celebrated that festival like that since the time that Joshua lived. And
they were very joyful. 
\p
\v 18 Every day during that week Ezra read to the people from the scroll that contained the laws that God
\add gave Moses\add*. Then on the eighth day, just as one of the laws of God said that they should do, they gathered together
to end the celebration.
