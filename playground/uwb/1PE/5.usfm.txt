\c 5  
\s 1 Peter 5:1-7 
\s You elders must care for your congregations with enthusiasm, not being greedy for money or acting like bosses. Instead, be
examples to them. 
\p
\v 1  \add Now I will say this to those among\add* you who are elders in the congregations: I also am an elder. I am one
\add of those\add* who saw Christ when he suffered, and I am also one who will share some of the glory/greatness that Christ
has in heaven. 
\v 2  \add I appeal to you elders\add* to take care of the people who are in your
\add congregations\add* [MET] as shepherds \add take care of their\add* flocks of sheep. Do this, not because you must do it,
but instead do it willingly, as God desires. Do not be greedy to get a lot
\add of money for doing it\add*, but instead do it enthusiastically/wholeheartedly.
\v 3 Do not act like domineering \add bosses over\add* the people [MET] whom God has assigned/entrusted to you, but instead be
examples to them by the way in which you conduct your lives. 
\v 4  \add If you do that\add*, when Jesus, who is \add like\add* our chief shepherd [MET], appears, he will give each of you a
\add glorious/wonderful reward\add* [MET]. \add That reward will be
like\add* the wreaths \add that are given to victorious athletes\add*, but your reward will never wither
\add like wreaths do\add*. 
\p
\v 5  \add Now I will say this to\add* you young men \add and women\add*.
\add Just like married men and women are\add* ◄\add to be subject/to submit
themselves\add*► \add to their spouses\add*, you must ◄be subject/submit yourselves► ◄to the older men/to the leaders►
\add of the congregation\add*. And all of you \add believers\add* should act [MET] humbly toward each other, because this
proverb is true, 
\q God opposes people who are proud, but he acts kindly toward those who are humble.
\p
\v 6 Therefore, realizing that God has great power [MTY] \add to punish proud
people\add*, humble yourselves in order that he may honor you at the time that
\add he has determined\add*. 
\v 7 Because he takes care of you, let him take care of all the things that you are worried/concerned about.
\s 1 Peter 5:8-11 
\s Resist the devil by always being alert and trusting in Christ's message, remembering that believers everywhere are also
suffering as you are. 
\p
\v 8 Always be alert with your full attention, because the devil, who is your enemy, is going/sneaking around, looking for
people \add to destroy\add*. \add He is\add* like [SIM] a lion who roars as it prowls around, seeking someone to
\add kill and\add* devour. 
\v 9 You must resist him by continuing to firmly trust in \add Christ and his
message\add*, remembering that your fellow believers all over the world are experiencing similar sufferings
\add that the devil is bringing to them\add*. 
\v 10 God is the one who kindly helps us in every \add situation\add*, and
\add he is the one\add* who chose us to share his eternal glory/greatness
\add in heaven\add* because of our relationship with Christ. \add And\add* after you have suffered for a while
\add because of things that people do to harm you\add*, he will remove your spiritual defects/imperfections, he will strengthen
you \add spiritually\add* [DOU], and he will support you \add emotionally\add*.
\v 11  \add I pray/desire that\add* he will \add rule\add* powerfully forever. ◄May it be so!/Amen!►
\s 1 Peter 5:12-14 
\s I have written this short message to encourage you. The believers here, including Mark, greet you. May God give you inner
peace. 
\p
\v 12 Silas has written this letter \add for me as I have\add* ◄\add dictated it to him/told him what to
write\add*►. I consider/know that he is a faithful fellow believer. I have written this short letter to you to encourage you,
and I want to assure you that \add what I have written\add* is a true message about the things that God kindly does for
\add us, things that we do not deserve\add*. Continue to firmly believe this message.
\p
\v 13 In \add this city that is sometimes referred to as\add* ‘Babylon’ [MET], the believers [SYN], whom
\add God\add* has chosen \add to belong to him\add* just like he chose you, ◄send
you\add (pl)\add* their greetings/say that they are thinking affectionately about you►. Mark, who is [MET]
\add like\add* a son to me, also ◄\add sends you his greetings/says that he is thinking affectionately about
you\add*►. 
\v 14 Greet each other with a kiss \add on the cheek\add* to \add show
that\add* you love \add each other\add*. \add I pray that God will give
inner\add* peace to all of you who have a relationship with Christ.
