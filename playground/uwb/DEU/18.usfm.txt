\c 18  
\s What the priests were to receive 
\p
\v 1 “The priests, who are all from the tribe of Levi, will not receive any land in Israel. Instead, they will receive some of
the food that other people offer to be burned \add on the altar to be
sacrificed\add* to Yahweh and some of the other sacrifices that will be offered to Yahweh.
\v 2 They will not be allotted any land like the other tribes will be. What they will receive is the work/privilege of being
Yahweh's \add priests\add*, which is what he said that they should have.
\p
\v 3 When the people bring an ox or a sheep to be sacrificed, they must give to the priests the shoulder, the cheeks/jaws, and
the stomach of those animals. 
\v 4 You must also give to them the first part of the grain that you
\add harvest\add*, and the first part of the wine \add that you make\add*, and the first part of the
\add olive\add* oil \add that you make\add*, and the first part of the wool that you shear from your sheep.
\v 5 You must do this because Yahweh our God has chosen the tribe of Levi from all of your tribes, in order that it would be
ones \add from that tribe\add* who would always be the priests who would serve him.
\p
\v 6 If any man from the tribe of Levi \add who has been living in one
of\add* the towns in Israel wants to come from there to the place of worship that Yahweh has chosen,
\add and start living there\add*, 
\v 7 he is permitted to serve Yahweh there as a priest, just like the other men from the tribe of Levi who have been serving
there. 
\v 8 He must be given the same amount of food \add that the other priests
receive\add*. He is permitted to keep the money \add that his relatives
receive\add* for selling some of their possessions \add and send to
him\add*. 
\s A warning about pagan practices 
\p
\v 9 When you enter the land that Yahweh our God is giving you, you must not imitate the disgusting things that the
people-groups who are there now do. 
\v 10 You must not sacrifice any of your children by burning them
\add on your altars\add*. Do not practice ◄divination/using supernatural power to reveal
\add what will happen in\add* the future►. Do not do/practice ◄soothsaying/magic to find out what will happen in the future►.
Do not ◄interpret omens/say that because of something that you have seen you know what will happen►. Do not practice
sorcery/witchcraft. Do not practice ◄putting spells on people/saying things to cause bad things to happen to others►.
\v 11 Do not try to talk with spirits of dead people. Do not do/practice magic.
\v 12 Yahweh hates people who do any of those disgusting things. And as you advance through that land, he is going to expel the
people-groups because they do/practice those disgusting things. 
\v 13 But you must always avoid doing any of those things. 
\s The promise to send a prophet like Moses 
\p
\v 14 The people-groups that you are about to expel \add from the land that you will
occupy\add* ◄consult/seek advice from► soothsayers and those who practice divination. But as for you, Yahweh our God does not
allow you to do that. 
\v 15  \add Some day\add* he will send from among you a prophet like me. He
\add is the one who will tell you what will happen in the future\add*, and he is the one whom you must heed.
\v 16 On the day that your ancestors were gathered at the bottom of Sinai Mountain, they pleaded with me saying, ‘We do not
want Yahweh to speak [MTY] to us again, and we do not want to see this huge fire
\add that is burning on the mountain\add*!’ \add Your ancestors said that because they were
afraid\add* that they would die \add if Yahweh spoke to them again\add*.
\p
\v 17 Then Yahweh said to me, ‘What they have said is true/wise.
\v 18 So I will send from among them a prophet like you. I will tell him what to say, and then he will tell people everything
that I tell him to say. 
\v 19 He will speak for me. And I will punish anyone who does not heed what he says.
\v 20 But if any person \add says that he is\add* a prophet and dares to speak a message which he falsely says comes from me
but which I did not tell him to speak, or anyone who speaks a message that he says other gods [MTY] have revealed to him, he
must be executed \add for doing that\add*.’ 
\p
\v 21 But if you say to yourself, ‘How can we know if a message \add that someone tells
us\add* does not come from Yahweh?’ 
\v 22  \add The answer is that\add* when someone speaks a message
\add about what will happen in the future\add*, a message that he says was revealed by Yahweh, if what he says does not happen,
\add you will know that\add* the message did not come from Yahweh. That person has wrongly claimed that it was revealed to him
by Yahweh. So you do not need to be afraid of anything that he \add says\add*.”
