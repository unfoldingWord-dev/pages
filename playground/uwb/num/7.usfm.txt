\s The offerings brought to the Sacred Tent 
\p
\v 1 When Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* had finished setting up the Sacred Tent, he\f + \ft Or: I \f* dedicated \f + \ft metonymy \f* it to Yahweh. He\f + \ft Or: I \f* also dedicated the things
that are inside the tent, and the altar \add for burning sacrifices\add*, and all the things that would be used at the altar.
\v 2 Then the leaders of \add the twelve\add* Israeli tribes, the same men who had
\add helped Aaron and Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f*\add* to count the men \add who could fight in
battles\add*, 
\v 3 came to the tent, bringing gifts to Yahweh. They brought six sturdy\f + \ft Or: large \f* carts and twelve oxen, one ox from each of the
leaders and a cart from each of the two leaders. 
\p
\v 4 Then Yahweh said to Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f*, 
\v 5 “Accept these gifts, in order that the descendants of Levi can use them for carrying the sacred items that are here at the
Sacred Tent.” 
\p
\v 6 So Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* took the carts and oxen and gave them to the descendants of Levi.
\v 7 He\f + \ft Or: I \f* gave two carts and four oxen to the descendants of Gershon for their work,
\v 8 and he\f + \ft Or: I \f* gave four carts and eight oxen to the descendants of Merari for their work. Aaron's son Ithamar was the
supervisor of all their work. 
\v 9 But he\f + \ft Or: I \f* did not give any carts or oxen to the descendants of Kohath, because they took care of the sacred items that were
to be carried on their shoulders, \add not on carts\add*. 
\p
\v 10 On the day that the altar was dedicated \f + \ft metonymy \f*, the \add twelve\add* leaders brought other gifts to be dedicated and put
them in front of the altar. 
\v 11 Yahweh said to Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f*, “Each of the next twelve days one leader should bring his gifts for the dedication of the
altar.” 
\p
\v 12-83 These are the gifts that each of the leaders brought: 
\pi —a silver dish that weighed more than 3 pounds\f + \ft Or: 1.5 kg.►, and a silver bowl that weighed ◄almost 2 pounds, Or: 800 grams \f*, both
of which were full of good flour and mixed with \add olive\add* oil to be grain offerings; they both were weighed using the
standard scales; 
\pi —a small gold dish that weighed 4 ounces\f + \ft Or: 14 grams \f*, filled with incense;
\pi —a young bull, a \add full-grown\add* ram, and a year-old ram, to be sacrifices completely burned on the altar;
\pi —a goat to be sacrificed to \add remove people's guilt for their\add* sins;
\pi —and two bulls, five full-grown rams, five male goats, and five rams that were one year-old, to be sacrifices to restore
the people's fellowship with Yahweh. 
\p This was the order in which the leaders brought their gifts: 
\pi on the first day, Nahshon from the tribe of Judah brought his gifts;
\pi on the next\f + \ft Or: second \f* day, Nethanel from the tribe of Issachar;
\pi on the next\f + \ft Or: third \f* day, Eliab from the tribe of Zebulun; 
\pi on the next\f + \ft Or: fourth \f* day, Elizur from the tribe of Reuben; 
\pi on the next\f + \ft Or: fifth \f* day, Shelumiel from the tribe of Simeon; 
\pi on the next\f + \ft Or: sixth \f* day, Eliasaph from the tribe of Gad; 
\pi on the next\f + \ft Or: seventh \f* day, Elishama from the tribe of Ephraim;
\pi on the next\f + \ft Or: eighth \f* day, Gamaliel from the tribe of Manasseh;
\pi on the next\f + \ft Or: ninth \f* day, Abidan from the tribe of Benjamin; 
\pi on the next\f + \ft Or: tenth \f* day, Ahiezer from the tribe of Dan; 
\pi on the next\f + \ft Or: eleventh \f* day, Pagiel from the tribe of Asher; 
\pi on the next\f + \ft Or: twelfth \f* day, Ahira from the tribe of Naphtali. 
\p
\v 84-88 When the altar was dedicated to Yahweh, those \add twelve\add* leaders brought these gifts:
\pi —twelve silver plates and twelve silver bowls, weighing a total of about sixty pounds\f + \ft Or: 27.6 kg. \f*, each of them weighed on
the scales kept in the Sacred Tent; 
\pi —twelve gold dishes filled with incense, weighing a total of about 3 pounds\f + \ft Or: 1.4 kg. \f*, each weighed on those same scales;
\pi —twelve bulls, twelve \add full-grown\add* rams, and twelve year-old rams, to be sacrifices that were completely burned,
along with the grain offerings; 
\pi —twelve goats to be sacrificed to take away \add the guilt of the
people's\add* sins; 
\pi —and twenty-four bulls, sixty full-grown rams, sixty goats, and sixty rams that were a year-old, to be sacrifices to
restore the people's fellowship with Yahweh. 
\p
\v 89 Whenever Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* entered the Sacred Tent to talk with Yahweh, he\f + \ft Or: I \f* heard Yahweh's voice speaking between the two
\add images of\add* creatures with wings that were above the lid of the sacred chest.
