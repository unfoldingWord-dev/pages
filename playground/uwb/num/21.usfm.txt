\c 21  
\s The Israelis defeated the Canaanites 
\p
\v 1 The king of Arad \add city\add* lived in the area where the Canaan people-group lived, in the desert in the southern part
of the land. He heard a report that the Israelis were approaching on the road to Atharim
\add village\add*. So his army attacked the Israelis and captured some of them.
\v 2 Then the Israelis declared this solemnly: "Yahweh, if you will help us to defeat these people, we will completely destroy
all their towns." 
\v 3 Yahweh heard what they requested, and he enabled them to defeat the army of the Canaan people-group. The Israeli soldiers
killed all the people and destroyed their towns. \add Ever since that
time\add*, that place has been called Hormah \add which means 'destruction'\add*.
\s The bronze snake 
\p
\v 4 Then the Israelis left Hor Mountain and traveled on the road towards the Red Sea, in order to go around Edom
\add land\add*. But the people became impatient along the way, 
\v 5 and they began to grumble\f + \ft Or: complain \f* against God and against Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f*. They said, "Why have you brought us out of Egypt to
die here in this desert \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*? There is nothing to eat here, and nothing to drink. And we detest this lousy
\add manna\add* food!" 
\p
\v 6 So Yahweh sent poisonous snakes among them. Many of the people were bitten by the snakes and died.
\v 7 Then the people came to Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f* and cried out, saying, "We
\add now know that\add* we have sinned against Yahweh and against you. Pray to Yahweh, asking that he will take away the
snakes!" So Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* prayed for the people. 
\p
\v 8 Then Yahweh told him\f + \ft Or: me \f*, "Make a model\f + \ft Or: image \f* of a poisonous snake, and attach it to the top of a pole. If those who are
bitten by the snakes look at that model, they will recover\f + \ft Or: get well \f*."
\v 9 So Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* made a snake from bronze and attached it to the top of a pole. Then, when those who had been bitten by a snake
looked at the bronze snake, they recovered! 
\s The Israelis traveled to Moab 
\p
\v 10 Then the Israelis traveled to Oboth and camped\f + \ft Or: set up their tents \f* there.
\v 11 Then they left there, and went to Iye-Abarim, in the desert on the eastern border of Moab.
\v 12 From there they traveled to the valley where the Zered riverbed is, and camped there.
\v 13 Then they traveled to the north side of the Arnon \add River\add*. That area is in the desert next to the land where the
Amor people-group lived. The Arnon \add River\add* is the boundary between Moab and where the Amor people-group lived.
\v 14 That is why in the book called 'the Book of the Wars of Yahweh' it tells about
\q "Waheb \add town\add* in the Suphah area, and the ravines there;
\q2 and the Arnon \add River\add* 
\q
\v 15 and the ravines there, 
\q2 which extend as far as Ar \add village\add* on the border of Moab."
\m
\v 16 From there, the Israelis traveled to Beer. There was a well there, where Yahweh previously had said to Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f*, "Gather
the people together, and I will give them water." 
\v 17 There the Israelis sang this song: 
\q "O well, give us water! 
\q Sing about this well! 
\q
\v 18 Sing about this well 
\q2 which our leaders dug; 
\q2 they dug out \add the dirt\add* with their royal scepters and their walking sticks."
\m Then the Israelis left that desert and went through Mattanah,
\v 19 Nahaliel, and Bamoth \add village\add*. 
\v 20 Then they went to the valley in Moab where Pisgah Mountain rises above the desert.
\s The defeat of kings Sihon and Og 
\p
\v 21 Then the Israelis sent messengers to Sihon, the king of the Amor people-group. This was the message
\add that they gave him\add*: 
\pi
\v 22 "Allow us to travel through your country. We will stay on the king's highway,
\add the main road that goes from the south to the north\add*, until we have finished traveling through your land. We will not
walk through any field or vineyard, or drink water from your wells."
\p
\v 23 But King Sihon refused. He would not allow them to walk through his land. Instead, he sent his whole army to attack the
Israelis in the desert. They attacked the Israelis at Jahaz \add village\add*.
\v 24 But the Israelis completely defeated them and occupied their land, from the Arnon
\add River in the south\add* to the Jabbok \add River in the north\add*. They stopped at the border of the land where the Ammon
people-group lived, because \add the Ammon army was defending\add* the border strongly.
\v 25 So the Israelis occupied all the cities and towns where the Amor people-group lived, and some of the Israelis began to
live in them. They occupied Heshbon \add city\add* and the nearby villages.
\v 26 Heshbon was the capital of the country. It was the city where King Sihon ruled. His army had previously defeated the army
of the king of Moab, and then his people had begun to live in all of the land of Moab as far as the Arnon
\add River in the south\add*. 
\p
\v 27 For that reason, one of the poets wrote long ago, 
\q "Come to Heshbon, the city where King Sihon \add ruled\add*. 
\q2 We want the city to be restored\f + \ft Or: rebuilt \f*. 
\q
\v 28 A fire blazed from Heshbon; 
\q2 it burned down Ar \add city\add* in Moab, 
\q it destroyed \add everything on\add* the hills along the Arnon
\add River\add*. 
\q
\v 29 You people of Moab, terrible things have happened to you! 
\q2 You people who \add worship your god\add* Chemosh have been annihilated\f + \ft Or: wiped out \f*!
\q The men \add who worshiped\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* Chemosh have run away and are now refugees,
\q2 and the women \add who worshiped him\add* have been captured by
\add the army of\add* Sihon, the king of the Amor people-group. 
\q
\v 30 But we have defeated those descendants of Amor, 
\q2 all the way from Heshbon \add in the north\add* to Dibon \add city in the
south\add*. 
\q We have completely obliterated\f + \ft Or: destroyed \f* them as far as Nophah and Medeba
\add towns\add*." 
\p
\v 31 So the Israeli people began to live in the land where the Amor people-group lived.
\p
\v 32 After Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* sent some men to explore the area near Jazer
\add city\add*, Israeli people began to live in all the towns in that region and expelled the Amor people-group who lived
there. 
\v 33 Then they turned \add north\add* toward the Bashan region, but King Og of Bashan and all his army attacked them at Edrei
\add town\add*. 
\p
\v 34 Yahweh said to Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f*, "Do not be afraid of Og, because I am going to enable your men to defeat him and his army, and
to take possession of all his land. You will do to him what you did to Sihon, the king of the Amor people-group, who ruled in
Heshbon." 
\p
\v 35 And that is what happened. The Israelis defeated Og's army, and killed King Og and his sons and all his people. Not a
person survived! And then the Israelis began to live in their land.
