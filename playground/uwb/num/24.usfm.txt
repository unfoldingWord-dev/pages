\c 24  
\p
\v 1 Balaam now realized that Yahweh wanted to bless the Israeli people,
\add not curse them\add*. So he did not use magic/divination \add like a shaman would
do\add* to find out what Yahweh wanted, as he often did. Instead, he turned toward the desert.
\v 2 He saw the Israeli people camped there \add in their tents\add*, with each tribe gathered in one group. Then the Spirit of
God came upon him, 
\v 3 and this is the prophetic message that he gave to Balak: 
\q “I, Balaam, the son of Beor, am giving this prophecy. 
\q2 This prophecy that I speak is as a man who sees \add what will happen in the
future\add* clearly speaks. 
\q
\v 4 I hear this message from God; 
\q2 I see a vision from the one who is all-powerful. 
\q2 My eyes are open as I prostrate myself in front of him. 
\b
\q
\v 5 You descendants of Jacob, your tents are very beautiful! 
\q2 The places where you live are lovely! 
\q
\v 6 Your tents are spread out \add in front of me like groves of palm trees
in\add* valleys, 
\q2 like gardens alongside a river. 
\q They are like strong aloe trees/plants that Yahweh has planted,
\q2 like \add strong\add* cedar trees \add that grow\add* along the rivers.
\q
\v 7 Your water buckets will always be full; 
\q2 the seeds \add that you plant\add* will always have plenty of water
\add to make them grow\add*. 
\b
\q The Israelis' king will be greater than \add King\add* Agag; 
\q2 the kingdom that he rules will be honored. 
\b
\q
\v 8 God brought them out of Egypt, 
\q2 \add leading them along\add* with his great power [MTY] like a wild ox has.
\q God devastates all the nations that oppose him; 
\q2 he breaks all those people's bones into pieces, 
\q2 and shoots them with his arrows. 
\q
\v 9 The Israelis are like lions that crouch and lie down, \add ready to spring on their
prey\add* [SIM], 
\q like lionesses \add that are resting\add*; 
\q2 no one [RHQ] would dare to arouse them! 
\p \add God\add* will bless everyone who blesses you Israelis, 
\q and he will curse everyone who curses you.” 
\b
\p
\v 10 Then King Balak was extremely angry with Balaam. He showed with his hands that he was very angry, and he
\add shouted\add*, saying, “I summoned you here to curse my enemies! Instead, you have ◄blessed/asked God to bless► them three
times! 
\v 11 So now, get out of here! Go back home! I said that I would pay you a lot of money
\add if you cursed them\add*, but Yahweh has prevented you from getting any pay!”
\p
\v 12 Balaam said to Balak, “\add Do you not remember\add* [RHQ] what I told the messengers that you sent to me? I said,
\v 13 ‘Even if Balak would give me a palace filled with silver and gold, I would not disobey Yahweh. I cannot do anything bad
or anything that is good \add that he does not approve of\add*.’ And I told you that I could say only what Yahweh says to me.
\v 14 So yes, I will return to my people, but first, allow me to tell you what will happen to you Moab people in the future.”
\s Balaam prophesied a fourth time 
\p
\v 15 Then Balaam said this \add to Balak\add*: 
\q “I, Balaam, son of Beor, am again giving a prophecy. 
\q2 This prophecy that I speak is again as a man who sees \add what will happen in the
future\add* clearly speaks. 
\q
\v 16 I hear a message from God; 
\q2 I know things that God, who lives in heaven, has \add revealed to
me\add*. 
\q I see a vision from the one who is all-powerful. 
\q2 My eyes are open as I prostrate myself in front of him. 
\b
\q
\v 17 The things that I see \add in the vision\add* are not \add going to
happen\add* \bd now\bd*; 
\q2 I see things \add that God will cause to happen\add* in the future.
\q A man whom is \add a descendant of\add* Jacob will appear like a star [MET];
\q2 a king who holds a scepter will be one of the Israeli people.
\q He will crush the heads of you people of Moab; 
\q2 he will wipe out the descendants of Seth. 
\q
\v 18 The Israelis will occupy Edom, 
\q2 and they will conquer their enemies \add who live near\add* Seir
\add Mountain\add*. 
\q2 The Israeli people will be victorious/strong. 
\q
\v 19 A ruler will come whom is a descendant of Jacob; 
\q2 he will get rid of the people who still live in the city \add where Balaam first met
Balak\add*.” 
\s Balaam's final prophecies 
\p
\v 20 Then Balaam looked out over where the Amalek people-group \add lived\add*, and he prophesied this:
\q “The Amalek people-group were the greatest nation, 
\q2 but they will be wiped out.” 
\p
\v 21 Then he looked out over the area where the Ken people-group
\add lived\add*, and he prophesied this: 
\q “You \add think that\add* the place where you live is secure/safe
\q2 like a nest that is made in the cliffs [MET], 
\q
\v 22 but you will be wiped out 
\q2 when the army of Assyria conquers you.” 
\p
\v 23 Balaam ended his prophecies by saying, 
\q “Also, ◄who can ‘survive/escape’ when God does all these things?/no one will be able to ‘survive/escape’ when God does all
these things!► [RHQ] 
\q
\v 24 Ships will come from Cyprus \add Island\add*, 
\q2 and the \add men in those ships\add* will defeat \add the armies
of\add* Assyria and Eber. 
\q2 But God will get rid of those men, too.” 
\p
\v 25 Then Balaam and Balak returned to their homes.
