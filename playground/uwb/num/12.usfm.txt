\c 12  
\s Miriam and Aaron were jealous of Moses 
\p
\v 1-2 Moses'/My \add older sister\add* Miriam and his/my \add older
brother\add* Aaron were saying this: “Is Moses the only one to whom Yahweh has spoken messages to tell to us \f + \fk rhetorical question \f*? Does Yahweh
not speak messages to us two also?” \add They told people that\add* they were saying that because Moses/I had married a woman
who was a descendant of the Cush people-group, \add but they were really saying that because they ◄were jealous/did not want
Moses/me to be the only leader of the Israeli people►\add*. But Yahweh heard what they were saying.
\p
\v 3  \add The truth was that\add* Moses/I was very humble. He/I was more humble than anyone else on the earth
\add and Moses/I had not appointed himself/myself to be their leader\add*.
\p
\v 4 So immediately Yahweh spoke to Moses/me and to Aaron and Miriam. He said, “All three of you must go and stand at the
Sacred Tent.” So they/we did that. 
\v 5 Then Yahweh descended to the entrance of the tent in a cloud
\add that resembled a huge white\add* pillar. He told Aaron and Miriam to step forward, so they did.
\v 6 Then he said to them, 
\q “Listen to me! 
\q When a prophet is among you, 
\q I \add usually\add* reveal myself to him by allowing him to see visions,
\q and I speak to him in dreams. 
\q
\v 7 But that is not the way I speak to my servant Moses. 
\q2 I trust that he will lead my people \add well\add*. 
\q
\v 8 So I talk to him face-to-face. 
\q2 I speak to him ◄clearly/using words that he will understand easily►, not using parables.
\q2 He has even seen what I look like. 
\q2 So you should be afraid to criticize my servant Moses!” 
\p
\v 9 Yahweh was very angry with Miriam and Aaron, and he left. 
\p
\v 10 When the cloud rose up from the Sacred Tent, Aaron looked at Miriam, and he saw that her skin was
\add as white\add* as snow, because she now had leprosy. 
\v 11 Aaron said to Moses/me, “My master, please do not punish us for this sin that we have foolishly committed.
\v 12 Do not allow Miriam to be like a baby that is already dead when it is born, whose flesh is already half decayed!”
\p
\v 13 So Moses/I cried out to Yahweh, saying, “God, I plead with you to heal her!”
\p
\v 14 But Yahweh replied, “If her father had \add rebuked her for doing something wrong
by\add* spitting in her face, she would have been ashamed for seven days.
\add She should be ashamed because of what she has done\add*. So send her outside the camp for seven days. Then
\add she will not have leprosy anymore, and\add* she may return to the camp.”
\v 15 So they sent her outside the camp for seven days. ◄The people/We► did not move
\add to another location\add* until she returned. 
\p
\v 16 But after \add she returned\add*, they/we left Hazeroth and moved
\add north\add* in the Paran Desert and set up their/our tents there.
