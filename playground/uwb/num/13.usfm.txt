\s Twelve Israeli men explored Canaan 
\p
\v 1 Yahweh said to Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f*, 
\v 2 "Send some men to Canaan \add land\add* to explore it. That is the land that I will give to you Israelis. Send men who are
leaders in their tribes." 
\p
\v 3 So Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* did what Yahweh commanded him\f + \ft Or: me \f*. He\f + \ft Or: I \f* sent out twelve Israeli men who were all leaders of their tribes. He\f + \ft Or: I \f*
sent them from their\f + \ft Or: our \f* camp at Paran in the desert. 
\v 4 These are the names of the men \add and the tribes they belonged
to:\add* 
\li Shammua, the son of Zaccur, from the tribe of Reuben; 
\li
\v 5 Shaphat, the son of Hori, from the tribe of Simeon; 
\li
\v 6 Caleb, the son of Jephunneh, from the tribe of Judah; 
\li
\v 7 Igal, the son of Joseph, from the tribe of Issachar; 
\li
\v 8 Hoshea, the son of Nun, from the tribe of Ephraim; 
\li
\v 9 Palti, the son of Raphu, from the tribe of Benjamin; 
\li
\v 10 Gaddiel, the son of Sodi, from the tribe of Zebulun; 
\li
\v 11 Gaddi, the son of Susi, from the tribe of Manasseh; 
\li
\v 12 Ammiel, the son of Gemalli, from the tribe of Dan; 
\li
\v 13 Sethur, the son of Michael, from the tribe of Asher; 
\li
\v 14 Nahbi, the son of Vophsi, from the tribe of Naphtali; 
\li
\v 15 and Geuel, the son of Maki, from the tribe of Gad. 
\m
\v 16 Those are the names of the men whom Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* sent out to explore Canaan.
\add Before they left\add*, Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* gave Hoshea a new name, Joshua,
\add which means\add* '\add Yahweh is the one who saves\add*.' 
\p
\v 17 Before Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* sent them to explore Canaan, he\f + \ft Or: I \f* said to them, "Go through the southern part of Canaan, and then go
\add north\add* into the hilly area. 
\v 18 See what the land is like. See if the people who live there are strong or weak. See if there are many people or only a
few people. 
\v 19 Find out what kind of land they live in \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*. Is it good or bad? Find out about the towns in which they live \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*. Do
they have walls around them or not? 
\v 20 Find out about the soil \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*. Is it fertile\f + \ft Or: good for growing crops \f* or not? Find out if there are trees there \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*.
Try to bring back some of the fruit that grows in that land." \add He said that
because\add* it was the beginning of the time to harvest grapes.
\p
\v 21 So those men went to Canaan. They went \add through the entire
land\add*, from the Zin wilderness \add in the south\add* all the way to Rehob
\add town\add* near Lebo-Hamath \add in the north\add*. 
\v 22 In the south, they went to Hebron, where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai,
\add huge men\add* descended from Anak, lived. Hebron was a city that was built seven years before Zoan
\add city\add* was built in Egypt. 
\v 23 In one valley, they cut from a grapevine one cluster of grapes.
\add Because it was very large, they needed\add* two men to carry it on a pole. They also picked some pomegranates and some
figs \add to carry back to their camp\add*. 
\v 24 They called that place Eshcol \add which means 'cluster'\add* because they had cut that
\add huge\add* cluster of grapes there. 
\v 25 After they explored the land for forty days, they returned to their camp.
\s The report about Canaan 
\p
\v 26 They came to Aaron and Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f* and the rest of the Israeli people in the desert at Paran. They reported to everyone what
they had seen. They also showed them the fruit that they had brought back.
\v 27 But this is what they reported to Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f*: "We arrived in the land that you sent us to explore. It is truly a beautiful
land. It is a very fertile [IDI] land. Here is some of the fruit.
\v 28 But the people who live there are very strong. Their cities are large and are surrounded by walls. We even saw some of
the \add huge\add* descendants of Anak there. 
\v 29 The descendants of Amalek live in the southern part \add of the
land\add*, and the descendants of Heth, Jebus, and Amor live in the hilly area
\add to the north\add*. The descendants of Canaan live along the coast of the
\add Mediterranean\add* sea and along the Jordan \add River\add*."
\p
\v 30  \add When they said that, the people were afraid and started to cry out very
loudly\add*. But Caleb told the people who were standing near Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f* to be quiet. Then he said, "We should go there and take
the land, because we are certainly able to conquer it!" 
\p
\v 31 But the men who had gone with him said, "No, we cannot attack
\add and defeat\add* those people! They are much stronger than we are!"
\v 32 So those men gave to the Israeli people a bad report about the land that they had explored. They said, "The land that we
explored is very large; we cannot conquer it. And all the people whom we saw are very tall.
\v 33 We even saw the descendants of Nephili there. The descendants of Anak
\add whom we saw there\add* are descended from the \add giant\add* Nephili people. When we saw them, we felt
\add as small as\add* grasshoppers \f + \ft simile \f*, and they thought that we looked like grasshoppers too!"
