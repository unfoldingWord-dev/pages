\v 3 On the fifteenth day of the first month \add of the year\add*, the day after we celebrated the ◄Passover/the time when
Yahweh killed all the firstborn sons of the people of Egypt►, they/we left Rameses
\add city in Egypt\add* and marched boldly while the Egyptian army was coming behind them/us.

\v 49 They/We set up our tents there; their/our tents stretched \add for several
miles/km.\add* from Beth-Jeshimoth to Acacia. 
\p
\v 50 While we were there on the plains of the Moab \add region\add* near the Jordan
\add River\add*, across from Jericho, Yahweh spoke to Moses/me. He said,
\v 51 “Tell this to the Israeli people: ‘When you cross the Jordan
\add River\add* and enter the Canaan \add region\add*, 
\v 52 you must force all the people who live there to leave. Destroy all their carved statues and all their idols made of
metal. Wreck all the places where they worship \add their idols\add*.
\v 53 Take their land from them and start to live there, because I have given their land to you for you to own.
\p
\v 54 Divide up the land by throwing ◄lots/small stones which have been marked►
\add to decide which group will get which area\add*. Give the larger areas to the groups that have more people, and give the
smaller areas to the groups that have fewer people. Each tribe will receive its own land.
\v 55 If you do not force the people who live there to leave, they will cause you to have much trouble. They will be like sharp
hooks in your eyes, and like thorns in your sides. And they will bring trouble to you, in that land where you will be living.
\v 56 And then I will punish you, as I had planned to punish them.’ ”
