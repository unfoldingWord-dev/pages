\c 6  
\s Rules about Nazir-men 
\p
\v 1 Yahweh also said this to Moses/me: 
\v 2 “Tell this to the Israeli people: If any of you \add wants to\add* make a solemn promise to dedicate himself to belong to
me in a special way, \add after you obey these instructions\add*, you will be called a Nazir-man,
\add which means\add* ‘\add a dedicated man\add*.’ 
\v 3 You must not drink any wine or other alcoholic/fermented drink. You must not drink any vinegar made from wine or from any
other alcoholic/fermented drink. You must not drink grape juice or eat grapes or raisins.
\v 4 You must not eat anything that comes from grapevines, not even the skins or seeds of grapes, during the time that you are
a Nazir-man. 
\p
\v 5 Even your hair will be dedicated to me during the time that you a Nazir-man, so you must never allow anyone to cut your
hair. Until the time that your solemn promise to dedicate yourself to me is ended, you must allow your hair to grow long.
\v 6 And you must not go near a corpse during the time that you are a Nazir-man.
\v 7 Even if the person who died is your father or your mother or your brother or your sister, you must not cause yourself to
become unacceptable to me \add by coming close to the corpse\add*. Your long hair \f + \fk metonymy \f* shows that you belong to me in a
special way, so you must do what you have solemnly promised \add and not cut your
hair\add*. 
\v 8 You are required to keep doing this all the time that you are dedicated to me in this special way.
\p
\v 9 If anyone dies very suddenly when he is near you, then your hair that you have dedicated to me is no longer sacred. So you
must wait seven days and then shave it all off. Then you must perform a special ritual to cause yourself to become acceptable
to me again. 
\v 10 The next day you must bring two doves or two young pigeons to the priest at the entrance of the Sacred Tent.
\v 11 The priest must \add kill the birds and\add* offer them as sacrifices. One of them will be an offering to take away the
guilt of your sin, and the other will be an offering that is burned completely to please me.
\add After the priests burns them on the altar\add*, I will forgive you for having come close to a corpse, and when your hair
\add grows again\add* it will be dedicated to me again. 
\v 12 The amount of time that you were set apart for me the previous time does not count, because you had become unacceptable
to me \add by coming close to a corpse\add* during the time that you were a Nazir-man. So you must again make a solemn promise
to dedicate yourself to me for the entire amount of time that you indicated the previous time. And you must also sacrifice a
year-old lamb to take away your guilt. 
\p
\v 13 When the time that you promised to dedicate yourself to me is ended, go to the entrance of the Sacred Tent
\v 14 and offer as sacrifices to me three animals that have no defects: offer a one year-old ram that will be burned
completely, a one year-old female lamb as a sacrifice to take away
\add the guilt of\add* your sin, and one full-grown ram as a sacrifice to restore fellowship with me.
\p
\v 15 When you bring those animals, you must also bring some wine to offer as a sacrifice. And you must also bring a basket of
bread that you have made with very good flour and \add olive\add* oil. But you must not put any yeast in the bread. Also
brush/spread some \add olive\add* oil on some thin wafers and bring them to the priest.
\p
\v 16 The priest will put the young lamb and the young ram on the altar and completely burn them, in order that I will be
pleased and will forgive you. 
\v 17 Then he will kill the full-grown ram as an offering to restore fellowship with me, and he will also burn on the altar
some of the bread and the grain and wine. 
\p
\v 18 After that, you must \add stand at\add* the entrance of the Sacred Tent and shave off your hair. Then you must put that
hair in the fire that is under the \add animal that has been sacrificed\add* on the altar to restore fellowship with me.
\p
\v 19 The meat from the ram's shoulder must be boiled. After it is cooked, the priest will take it along with one of the loaves
of bread and one wafer which has been brushed with \add olive\add* oil, and he will put them in your hands.
\v 20 Then the priest will \add take them back\add* and lift them up high to dedicate them to me. They now belong to the
priest, and he is permitted to eat some of the meat from the ram's shoulder and from its ribs and from one of its thighs,
because that meat is his share of the sacrifice. After that, you will no longer be a Nazir-man, and you will again be permitted
to drink wine. 
\p
\v 21 Those are the regulations about the offerings that Nazir-men solemnly promise to bring to me to end their time of being
dedicated to me. They must bring these offerings, but if they want to, they may bring additional offerings. And they must do
everything that they solemnly promised to do when they dedicated themselves to me.”
\s The blessing for the people 
\p
\v 22 Yahweh also said to Moses/me, 
\v 23 “Tell Aaron and his sons that when they \add ask me to\add* bless the people, they must say,
\q
\v 24 ‘I desire that Yahweh will bless you 
\q2 and protect you, 
\q
\v 25 and that he will smile on you 
\q2 and act kindly toward you, 
\q
\v 26 and that he will be good to you [IDI] 
\q2 and cause things to go well for you.’ ” 
\p
\v 27 Then Yahweh said, “If Aaron and his sons ask me to bless the Israeli people, truly I will bless them.”
