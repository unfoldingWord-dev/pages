\c 23  
\s Balaam blessed the Israeli people 
\p
\v 1 Balaam said to King Balak, “Build here seven altars for me. Then kill seven young bulls and seven rams
\add for a sacrifice\add*.” 
\v 2 So Balak did that. And then he and Balaam each burned a young bull and a ram
\add as a sacrifice\add* on each altar. 
\p
\v 3 Then Balaam said to Balak, “You stand here close to your burned offerings, and I will go and ask Yahweh if he has
something else to tell me. Then I will tell you what he says to me.”
\p Then Balaam went by himself to the top of a hill, 
\v 4 and God appeared to him there. Balaam said to him, “We have built seven altars, and I have killed and burned a young bull
and a ram \add as a sacrifice to you\add* on each altar.” 
\p
\v 5 Then Yahweh gave Balaam a message to give to King Balak. Then he said, “Go back and tell him what I told you.”
\p
\v 6 When Balaam returned to Balak, Balak was standing with the leaders from Moab beside the offerings he had burned
\add on the altar\add*. 
\v 7 This is the message that Balaam told them: 
\q “Balak summoned me to come here from Syria; 
\q2 the king of Moab brought me here from the hills at the eastern side of Syria.
\q He said, ‘Come and curse the descendants of Jacob for me! 
\q2 Come and say that bad things will happen to these Israeli people!’
\q
\v 8 But ◄how can I curse people whom God has not cursed?\f + \ft Or: I \f* certainly cannot curse people whom God has not cursed!► \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f*
\q ◄How can I condemn people whom Yahweh has not condemned?\f + \ft Or: I \f* cannot condemn people whom Yahweh has not condemned!► \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f*
\q
\v 9 I have seen them from the tops of the rocky peaks, 
\q2 I have seen them from the hills. 
\q I see that they are a group of people who live by themselves.
\q2 They have separated themselves from \f + \ft (OR, they are not like) \f* other nations.
\q
\v 10 ◄Who can count the descendants of Jacob; they are as numerous as particles of ‘dust\f + \ft Or: dirt \f*’?\f + \ft Or: No \f* one can count the
descendants of Jacob; they are as numerous as particles of ‘dust\f + \ft Or: dirt \f*’!► \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f*
\q ◄Who can count even a quarter of the Israeli people?\f + \ft Or: No \f* one can count even a quarter of the Israeli people!► \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f*
\q I wish\f + \ft Or: hope \f* that I will die like righteous people die; 
\q2 I hope that I will die \add peacefully\add* like they will die.”
\p
\v 11 Then Balak said, “What have you done to me \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f*? I brought you here to curse my enemies, but instead you have ◄blessed
them\f + \ft Or: asked \f* Yahweh to bless them►!” 
\p
\v 12 But Balaam replied, “I can \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* say only what Yahweh tells me to say. I cannot say anything else.”
\s Balaam prophesied about the Israelis again 
\p
\v 13 Then King Balak told Balaam, “Come with me to another place. There you will see only part of the Israeli people, and you
will be able to curse those people for me.” 
\v 14 So Balak took Balaam to a field on the top of Pisgah Mountain. There, again he built seven altars and offered a young
bull and a ram \add as a sacrifice\add* on each altar. 
\p
\v 15 Then Balaam said to the king, “Stand here close to your burned offerings, while I go and talk with Yahweh.”
\p
\v 16 So Balaam did that, and Yahweh appeared to Balaam again and gave him another message. Then he said, “Go back to Balak and
tell him that message.” 
\p
\v 17 So Balaam returned to where the king and the leaders from Moab were standing, next to the altar where Balak had burned
the sacrifices. Balak asked him, “What did Yahweh say?” 
\p
\v 18 Then Balaam told him this message: 
\q “Balak, listen carefully; 
\q2 hear what I have to say, you son of Zippor \\f + \\ft doublet \\f*! 
\q
\v 19 God is not a human being. 
\q2 Humans lie, but God never lies. 
\q He never changes his mind\f + \ft Or: thoughts \f*, as humans do. 
\q Whatever he has said that he will do, he does. 
\q Whatever he has promised to do, he has \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* done it. 
\q
\v 20 He commanded me \add to request him\add* to bless \add the
Israelis\add*, 
\q2 So he has blessed them, and I cannot change that. 
\b
\q
\v 21 Yahweh their God is with\f + \ft Or: helping \f* them; 
\q2 they have declared that he is their true king. 
\q So the descendants of Jacob will not be harmed; 
\q2 they will not have any troubles \\f + \\ft doublet \\f*. 
\q
\v 22 God brought them out of \add being slaves\add* in Egypt; 
\q2 he is as strong as a wild ox. 
\q
\v 23 When people curse \\f + \\ft personification \\f* the descendants of Jacob, they will not be harmed;
\q2 when people work sorcery on them, it will have no power. 
\q So now people will say about the descendants of Jacob, 
\q2 ‘God has done wonderful things for the Israelis!’ 
\q
\v 24 They are very strong, like lionesses that are ready to attack
\add other animals\add*; 
\q2 they stand firm like lions. 
\q The lions refuse to rest until they have \add killed and\add* eaten their prey,
\q2 and drunk the blood of the animals they slaughtered.” 
\p
\v 25 Then Balak said to Balaam, “If you will not curse them, then
\add I certainly\add* do not \add want you\add* to bless them!” 
\p
\v 26 But Balaam replied, “I told you that I must do only what Yahweh tells me to do!”
\s Balaam prophesied about the Israelis a third time 
\p
\v 27 Then King Balak said to Balaam, “Come with me; I will take you to another place. Perhaps it will please God to allow you
to curse them from that place.” 
\v 28 So Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor Mountain where they could look down
\add and see the Israelis in\add* the desert. 
\p
\v 29 Balaam again told Balak, “Build me seven altars again and kill seven young bulls and seven rams
\add for a sacrifice\add*.” 
\v 30 So Balak did what Balaam told him to do. He burned a young bull and a ram on each altar as sacrifices.
