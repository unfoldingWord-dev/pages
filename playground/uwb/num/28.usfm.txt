\c 28  
\s The daily offerings 
\p
\v 1 Yahweh said this to Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f*: 
\v 2 “Tell this to the Israeli people: ‘Bring to me the offerings that will be burned
\add on the altar\add*. When they are burned, the smell will be very pleasing to me. And tell them that they must bring them at
the proper\f + \ft Or: right \f* time. 
\v 3 Tell them that what they must bring to me each day are two male lambs that are a year-old. They must have no defects. They
must be completely burned \add on the altar\add*. 
\v 4 They should bring one in the morning and the other early in the evening.
\v 5 They must also bring a grain offering of two quarts\f + \ft Or: liters \f* of nice flour, mixed with a quart of
\add olive\add* oil. 
\v 6 That is the offering that they must bring every day. They started to bring those offerings
\add while you were\add* at Sinai Mountain. When those offerings are burned
\add on the altar\add*, the smell will be very pleasing to me. 
\v 7 When they burn each lamb, they must also pour on the sacred altar a quart\f + \ft Or: liter \f* of wine.
\v 8 In the evening, when they offer the second lamb, they must also bring the same offerings of grain and wine
\add as they burned in the morning\add*. When they are burned, the smell will also be very pleasing to me.’
\s The offerings on the Sabbath 
\p
\v 9 ‘On each Sabbath\f + \ft Or: rest day \f*, \add you must bring\add* two male lambs that have no defects. Also bring a grain offering of
four quarts\f + \ft Or: liters \f* of nice flour mixed with \add olive\add* oil and a wine offering of four quarts\f + \ft Or: liters \f* of wine.
\v 10 Those are the offerings that are to be burned \add on the altar\add* each Sabbath\f + \ft Or: rest day \f*. Those are in addition to
the offerings of two lambs and wine that you must bring each day.’
\s The monthly offerings 
\p
\v 11 ‘On the first day of each month, you must bring to me an offering of two young bulls, one male sheep, and seven male
lambs that are one year-old. All of these must be without defects. They must all be burned
\add completely on the altar\add*. 
\v 12 Also bring with each bull an offering of six quarts\f + \ft Or: liters \f* of nice flour mixed with
\add olive\add* oil. With each male sheep make an offering of four quarts of nice flour mixed with
\add olive\add* oil. 
\v 13 Also bring an offering of two quarts\f + \ft Or: liters \f* of nice flour mixed with
\add olive\add* oil with each lamb. When all of these are burned
\add on the altar\add*, the smell will be very pleasing to me. 
\v 14 With each bull, also bring two quarts\f + \ft Or: liters \f* of wine. With each male sheep, bring 1-1\f + \ft Or: 3 quarts, Or: 1.2 liters \f* of wine. With
each lamb, bring one quart\f + \ft Or: liter \f* of wine. These offerings must be brought on the first day of each month and burned completely
\add on the altar\add*. 
\v 15 In addition to these offerings that you burn, you must bring to me one goat for an offering
\add to remove the guilt of your\add* sins.’ 
\s The sacrifices during the festivals of Passover and Unleavened Bread
\p
\v 16 ‘The Passover festival must be celebrated to \add honor\add* me
\add each year\add* on the fourteenth day of your first month. 
\v 17 The festival of Unleavened Bread will start on the next day. For the following seven days, the bread that you eat must be
made without yeast. 
\v 18 On the first day of that festival, you must gather together to worship me, and you must not do any work.
\v 19 On that day, you must bring to me for an offering that will be completely burned
\add on the altar\add* two young bulls, one male sheep, and seven male lambs that are one year-old. They must all have no
defects. 
\v 20 With each of these bulls, bring a grain offering of six quarts\f + \ft Or: liters \f* of nice flour mixed with
\add olive\add* oil. With the male sheep, bring a grain offering of four quarts\f + \ft Or: liters \f* of nice flour mixed with

\v 22 Also bring one goat for a sacrifice to make atonement for your sin.
\v 23 Bring these offerings in addition to the offerings that you bring each morning.
\v 24 The smell of the grain that is burned \add on the altar\add* each day for seven days will be very pleasing to me. Bring
the grain in addition to the animals and the wine that you burn \add on the
altar\add*. 
\v 25 On the seventh day of that festival, you must \add again\add* gather together to worship me, and you must not do any
work.’

\p
\v 26 ‘On the day of the Harvest festival, when you bring to me the first grain that you have harvested, you must gather
together to worship me. Do not do any work on that day. 
\v 27 Bring to me two young bulls, one male sheep, and seven male lambs that are one year-old. When they are completely burned
