\s 2 Thessalonians 3:1-2 
\s Pray that more and more people will believe the message about our Lord Jesus.
\p
\v 1 As for the other matters, \add our\add* fellow believers, pray for us that more and more
\add people will\add* hear \f + \ft personification \f* our message \add about our\add* Lord
\add Jesus\add*. Pray that they will believe this message, as you
\add have done\add*. 
\v 2 Pray also for us that we will be rescued \f + \ft Or:that God will rescue us \f* from those very perverse, Or: evil people
\add here\add* who \add cause us to suffer. Pray like that\add* because
\add they and many others\add* refuse to believe \f + \ft litotes \f* \add this
message\add*. 
\s 2 Thessalonians 3:3-5 
\s Our Lord Jesus will cause you to continue to be steadfast and he will protect you from the evil one.
\p
\v 3  \add Remember that our\add* Lord \add Jesus\add* is trustworthy!
\add So we are sure that\add* he will cause you to continue to be steadfast.
\add We are also sure that\add* he will protect you from \add Satan\add*, the evil one \f + \ft Or: from evil \f*.
\v 4  \add Because of your close relationship with our\add* Lord
\add Jesus\add*, we are confident about you that you are obeying what we have commanded you, and we are confident that you will
obey what we are commanding \add you in this letter\add*. 
\v 5  \add We pray that our\add* Lord \add Jesus\add* would enable you to continue
\add knowing\add* that God loves you. \add We pray\add* also that Christ will cause you to continue
\add being\add* steadfast \f + \ft Or: being steadfast as he \add was steadfast\add* \f*.
\s 2 Thessalonians 3:6-11 
\s We command you to disassociate yourselves from every fellow believer who refuses to work.
\p
\v 6  \add Our\add* fellow believers, we command you, with the authority \f + \ft metonymy \f* that our Lord Jesus Christ
\add has given to us\add*, that you stop associating with every fellow believer who is lazy and refuses to work. That is, you
must stay away from those who are not \add conducting their lives\add* in the manner that we taught you.
\v 7  \add We tell you this\add* because you yourselves know that you should
\add behave\add* like we \add behaved\add*. We did not just sit
\add around\add* without working\f + \ft Or: were never lazy \f* \add while we were
living\add* among you. 
\v 8 Specifically, we did not eat anyone's food if we did not pay
\add that person\add* for it. Instead, we worked very hard \add to support ourselves\f + \ft Or: to earn the money to buy what we
needed\add* \f*. We worked hard \f + \ft doublet \f* during the day and the night, in order that we would not have to depend on any of you
\add to supply what we needed\add*. 
\v 9 We have always had the right \add to depend on you for money, but instead we worked hard in order to make
ourselves\add* examples for you, in order that you should behave like we behave.
\v 10 Remember that when we were \add there\add* with you, we kept commanding you that if any
\add fellow believer\add* refuses to work, \add you should not give\add* him food to eat.
\v 11  \add We command you this\add* again now, because someone has told to us that some of you are lazy and not working at
all! Not only that, some of you are interfering \add with what other people are
doing!\add* 
\s 2 Thessalonians 3:12 
\s We command those fellow believers who are not working to support themselves by settling down and working.
\p
\v 12 We command those fellow believers who are not working, and urge
\add them\add* by the authority \f + \ft metonymy \f* of our Lord Jesus Christ, that they settle down and support themselves by working\f + \ft Or: work
to earn money to buy what they need \f*. 
\s 2 Thessalonians 3:13 
\s You others, do not stop doing what is right because you are discouraged.
\p
\v 13 Fellow believers! Do not ever get tired of doing what is right!
\s 2 Thessalonians 3:14-15 
\s Publicly identify any fellow believer who does not obey what we have written in this letter and do not associate with him.
\p
\v 14 If any \add fellow believer refuses to work\add* and does not obey what I have written in this letter,
\add publicly\add* identify that person\f + \ft Or: tell the congregation what that person is doing \f*. Then do not associate with him, in
order that he may become ashamed. 
\v 15 Do not think of him as though he was\add your\add* enemy; instead, warn him as
\add you would warn your other\add* fellow believers. 
\s 2 Thessalonians 3:16a 
\s I pray that our Lord Jesus himself will give peace to you always and in every situation.
\p
\v 16  \add I pray that our\add* Lord \add Jesus\add* himself, who
\add gives inner\add* peace \add to his people\add*, will give \add inner\add* peace to you always and in every
situation\f + \ft Or: whatever happens \f*. 
\s 2 Thessalonians 3:16b-18 
\s In closing, I pray that our Lord Jesus will continue to bless you all. I, Paul, am greeting you and I am writing this myself
in order that you may know that it is I who have sent this letter.
\p I \add pray that our\add* Lord \add Jesus will continue to\add* help you all.
\v 17 Now, having taken the pen from my scribe, I, Paul, am sending this greeting to you as I write this myself \f + \ft synecdoche \f*. I do
this in all my letters in order that you may know that it is truly I who have sent this letter. This is how I always end my
letters. 
\v 18 I pray that our Lord Jesus Christ will continue to act kindly to you all.
