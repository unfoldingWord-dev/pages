\c 2  
\s 2 Thessalonians 2:1-3a 
\s Do not be quickly troubled in mind and alarmed by any message that the Day of the Lord has already come.
\p
\v 1 Now \add I want to write to you\add* about the time when our Lord Jesus Christ will return and when
\add God\add* will gather us together to \add where Jesus\add* is. My fellow believers, I urge you
\v 2 that you think calmly \add about any message\add* that \add claims\f + \ft Or: says \f*\add* that the Lord has
\add already\add* come again. Do not be shaken or alarmed\f + \ft Or: worried \f* by any such message.
\add It does not matter\add* if \add it is a message that someone claims God's
Spirit\add* revealed to him, or if \add it is some other message that
someone\add* has spoken, or whether \add it is a message that someone
claims\add* that I wrote in a letter. 
\v 3 Do not allow anyone to deceive you in any way \add with the result that you believe any such
message\add*. 
\s 2 Thessalonians 2:3b-5 
\s The Lord will come only after that time when the man who will sin very greatly will appear.
\p \add The Lord\add* will not come \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add immediately\add*. First,
\add many people\add* \f + \ft personification \f* will rebel \add against God\add*. The result of their rebelling will be that
\add they will accept and obey\add* the man who will sin very greatly
\add against God\add*. 
\v 4 He will be the \add supreme\add* enemy \add of God\add*. He will
\add proudly\add* exalt himself above everything that \add people\add* consider to be God and above everything that people
worship. \add As a result of wanting people to worship him\add*, he will
\add even enter\add* God's Temple and sit down \add there to rule\add*! He will publicly proclaim that he himself is God! But
\add God\add* will \add certainly\add* punish that man forever! 
\v 5 ◄I am sure that you remember that I kept telling you these things while I was still with you
\add there in Thessalonica\add*.\f + \ft Or: Do \f* you not remember that I continued telling to you these things while I was still with you
\add there in Thessalonica\add*?► \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* 
\s 2 Thessalonians 2:6-8 
\s This man will be revealed by God when he who is now preventing him from being revealed will have been removed by God.
\p
\v 6 You also know that there is something \f + \ft Or: someone \f* that is preventing this man
\add from being revealed\add* {\add from revealing himself\add*}. He is being held back\f + \ft Or: restrained \f*
\add now\add* in order that he be revealed {that he reveal himself} at the time that
\add God has planned\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*. 
\v 7  \add Although Satan\add* is already secretly causing \add people\add* to reject
\add God's\add* laws, the one\f + \ft Or: God \f* who is preventing \add this man from revealing
himself\add* now\add will continue to prevent him\add* until he\f + \ft Or:  \f*\add God\add* removes him.
\v 8 It is then that \add God will allow\add* this man, who rejects
\add God's\add* laws \add completely\add*, to be revealed {to reveal himself}. Then the Lord Jesus, by what he commands \f + \ft metonymy \f*,
will destroy him. Jesus, by his own glorious arrival, will cause him to become
\add completely\add* powerless. 
\s 2 Thessalonians 2:9-12 
\s When this man is present, he will completely deceive those who will perish.
\p
\v 9 But \add before Jesus destroys him\add*, Satan will give him very great power. As a result, he
\add will do all kinds of supernatural\add* miracles and amazing deeds \f + \ft doublet \f* that will seem as though
\add God has enabled him to do them\add*. 
\v 10 And by doing wicked \add deeds\add*, he will completely deceive those who will
\add certainly\add* perish\f + \ft Or: go to hell \f*. \add He will deceive them\add* because they will have refused to love the true
\add message\add*. So they will not be saved {God will not save them}.
\v 11 So, God, by his power, will enable this man to easily deceive them, so that they will believe what
\add this man\add* falsely \add claims\f + \ft Or: says \f* that he is\add*. 
\v 12 The result will be that everyone will be \add justly\add* condemned {that
\add God\add* will \add justly\add* condemn everyone} \add to be
punished\add* who did not believe the true \add message\add*, but who instead gladly chose
\add to be doing\add* what is wicked. 
\s 2 Thessalonians 2:13-14 
\s God chose you and summoned you in order that you should be saved and share in Christ's glory.
\p
\v 13  \add Our\add* fellow believers, whom our Lord \add Jesus\add* loves, we thank God very frequently for you. It is
appropriate\f + \ft Or: right \f* for us to do that, because God chose you from the beginning \f + \ft metonymy \f*
\add of creation\f + \ft Or: before the world existed\add* \f* in order that he might save
\add you\add* as a result of \add your\add* believing the true \add message\add* and as a result of
\add God's\add* Spirit setting you apart \add for God\add*. 
\v 14  \add We thank God that\add* he chose you as a result of our
\add proclaiming\add* the message about Christ \add to you\add*, in order that you might share in\f + \ft Or: have \f* some of the glory that
our Lord Jesus Christ has. 
\s 2 Thessalonians 2:15 
\s Continue believing the teaching that we committed to you. 
\p
\v 15 So\add , our fellow believers, continue to be firm concerning what you
believe\add*; that is, continue believing the \add true\add* teaching that we committed\f + \ft Or: taught \f* to you by our speaking to you
and by our \add writing\add* a letter \add to you\add*. 
\s 2 Thessalonians 2:16-17 
\s We pray that our Lord Jesus Christ himself will encourage you and cause you to continue doing and speaking what is good.
\p
\v 16  \add We pray for you to\add* our Lord Jesus Christ himself and to God, our Father. God loves us and encourages us and
causes us to confidently expect \add to receive\add* the eternal things that
\add he has promised to give to us\add* as a result of \add Christ\add* acting kindly toward us in a way we did not deserve.
\v 17  \add We strongly pray that\add* God and Jesus together will encourage you! And we pray that they will cause you to
continue doing and saying things that God considers to be good.
