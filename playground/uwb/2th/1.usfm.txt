\v 1  \add I\add*, Paul, \add am writing this letter\add*. Silas and Timothy
\add are with me. We are sending this letter\add* to \add you\add*. You are the congregation
\add of God's people\add* in Thessalonica \add city\add*. You belong to God our Father, and you belong to Jesus Christ our
Lord. 
\v 2  \add We pray that\add* God our Father, and Jesus Christ our Lord,
\add will continue to\add* act kindly toward you and \add will continue to cause you to have
inner\add* peace. 
\s 2 Thessalonians 1:3-4 
\s We thank God very frequently that you are trusting in the Lord Jesus more and more.
\p
\v 3  \add Our\add* fellow believers, we thank God very frequently \f + \fr hyperbole \f* for you because we believers ought
\add to thank God for each other, and\add* specifically it is appropriate/right
\add that we should thank God for you. We thank him\add* that you are trusting in
\add the Lord Jesus\add* more and more, and that each one of you is loving
\add each of\add* the others more and more. 
\v 4 As a result, we keep proudly telling about you to the \add other\add* congregations who
\add worship\add* God. \add Specifically, we tell them\add* that you are being steadfast and that you
\add continue\add* believing \add in the Lord Jesus\add*, even though you are frequently suffering \f + \fr doublet \f* as a result of people
causing you trouble. 
\s 2 Thessalonians 1:5-10 
\s God will judge all people justly. Specifically, he will publicly declare that you are worthy to enter that place where he
will rule his people forever. 
\p
\v 5  \add Your being steadfast\add* ◄shows/indicates to► \add us\add* clearly that God will judge
\add all people\add* justly. \add Specifically, he\add* will publicly declare that you are worthy
\add as his people to be in\add* that place where he will rule \add forever,
because\add* you also are suffering as a result of \add telling others about
letting\add* God rule your lives. 
\v 6  \add God will certainly cause trouble for\add* those people who are troubling you, because he
\add considers\add* that it is just that he should punish such people for doing that to you.
\v 7 He also \add considers\add* that it is just that he should reward you who are being troubled, by ◄giving you
relief/causing your suffering to end►. He will do that for both you and us when our Lord Jesus will descend from heaven,
together with his powerful angels and with blazing fire. 
\v 8  \add Then he will\add* punish those people who do not \add want
to\add* know him and \add those\add* who refuse to obey the message about our Lord Jesus.
\v 9  \add Our Lord Jesus\add* will forbid them from ever coming near to him and near to the glory which he has
\add because he is so\add* powerful (OR, the glory that is manifested by his power). He will cause those people to suffer
forever. 
\v 10  \add The Lord Jesus\add* will do this when he comes \add back from
heaven\add* at the time \add that God has decided\add*. As a result, all we who are his people will praise him because of
\add what he has done for his own\add* people, and all we believers will marvel at our Lord because of
\add what he has done. And you will be there, too\add*, because you believed what we testified to you.
\s 2 Thessalonians 1:11-12 
\s We are praying very frequently for you that God will consider you worthy to receive that to which he summoned you.
\p
\v 11 In order that you might \add praise Jesus like this\add*, we are also praying very frequently \f + \fr hyperbole \f* for you. We pray that
\add you will be able to show\add* our God that you are worthy \add to
receive\add* that which he chose \add you to receive\add*. We pray also that he would powerfully enable you to do good in every
way that you desire, and that he would also enable you to do powerfully every
\add good\add* deed \add that you do because\add* you believe \add in Jesus
Christ\add*. 
\v 12  \add We pray this because we want\add* you to praise our Lord Jesus, and we want him to honor you. This will happen
because God, whom we \add worship/serve\add*, and our Lord Jesus Christ keep acting kindly
\add toward you\add* in ways that you do not deserve.
