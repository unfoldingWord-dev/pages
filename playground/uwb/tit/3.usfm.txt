\s Titus 3:1-2 
\s Remind the believers to act appropriately toward authorities and kindly toward everyone.
\p
\v 1 Remind \add the believers\add* that they should submit to all those who rule them or have authority over them, and that
they should obey them. They should be ready to do anything that is helpful.
\v 2 They should never say bad things about anyone, they should not quarrel with people, they should be patient
\add when others\add* ◄\add irritate them\f + \ft Or: do \f* things that they do not
like\add*►, \add and they should\add* always treat all people as important.
\s Titus 3:3-7 
\s God acted kindly toward us and mercifully saved us, even though formerly we were behaving sinfully.
\p
\v 3  \add Remind your congregations about these things\add* because formerly we
\add believers\add* ourselves were also foolish, just like \add all people who do not believe in Christ are now.
We\add* did not obey ◄\add God\add*\f + \ft Or: God \f*'s message►. \add We let\add* others deceive us. We ◄spent all our time
doing\f + \ft Or: continually \f* did► what is evil and could not stop ourselves from doing all the things that our bodies liked \\f + \\ft doublet \\f*. We were
◄envying others\f + \ft Or: desiring \f* to have what others have►. We were causing people to hate us and we were hating one another.
\v 4-5 Even though we were behaving sinfully like this, he saved us! God our Savior
\add acted\add* kindly and lovingly to us \\f + \\ft personification \\f*, \add and saved us!\add* He did this, not because we did things that are right,
but just because he \add wanted to be\add* merciful to us! He washed
\add us inwardly and gave\add* us a new way of living as a result of the Holy Spirit changing us inwardly.
\v 6  \add Because we trusted in\add* Jesus Christ our Savior, God put the Holy Spirit within us
\add in order to\add* wonderfully \add change us\add*. 
\v 7 He wanted to erase the record of our sins even though we did not deserve that, and he wanted us to receive all that
\add God desires\add* to give us. \add These are the things that
we\add* confidently expect to receive when we live \add with him\add* eternally.
\s Titus 3:8a 
\s I want you to confidently teach this trustworthy message to the believers in order that they will be constantly concerned
with doing what is good for others. 
\p
\v 8 These words that \add I\add* have said are trustworthy. So, I want you to confidently teach the things
\add that I have written about in this letter\add* to those who have trusted in God, in order that they will be constantly
devoted\f + \ft Or: attempting \f* to do deeds that are good and helpful for others.
\s Titus 3:8b-11 
\s Have nothing to do with foolish disputes about genealogies and about the Jewish law; and do not allow divisive people who
have turned away from the true teachings to influence the believers.
\p These \add teachings\add* are beneficial and profitable for \add all\add* people,
\v 9 but there are people who foolishly dispute\f + \ft Or: argue \f* \add with you, wanting you to
believe\add* senseless ◄\add myths\f + \ft Or: stories \f* that came from your ancestors\add*►, stories in which there are ◄genealogies\f + \ft Or: lists \f*
of your ancestors' names►. They argue and quarrel \add with you\add*,
◄\add insisting\f + \ft Or: telling \f* you\add*► \add that you must obey\add* the
\add Jewish\add* laws. ◄Keep \add completely\add* away from\f + \ft Or: Do \f* not talk with► them, because
\add arguing about such things\add* is not profitable \add for anyone. It is
completely\add* worthless! 
\v 10 Those people, \add by teaching things that are false\add*, are causing others ◄to turn away from\f + \ft Or: to \f* quit believing► the
true teachings. You must warn them \add that God will judge them if they continue doing that. If they do not
stop\add*, warn them one more time. \add If they still do not stop\add*, then no
\add longer\add* allow them\add to influence the believers\add*.
\v 11 You will know \add clearly\add* that such persons have \add deliberately\add* ◄turned away
\add from\f + \ft Or: quit \f* believing and obeying\add*► \add the true teachings\add*. They know that they are doing what is sinful,
\add but they deliberately keep on doing it\add*. 
\s Titus 3:12-14 
\s Make every effort to come to me at Nicopolis. Help Zenas and Apollos on their journey. All the believers should likewise
learn to devote themselves to doing good deeds for people who especially need help.
\p
\v 12 I \add expect to\add* send either Artemas or Tychicus to you.
\add As soon as one of them arrives\add*, ◄make every effort\f + \ft Or: try \f* hard► to come to me
\add quickly\add* at Nicopolis \add city\add*, because it is there that I have decided to
\add go and\add* stay during the stormy\f + \ft Or: winter \f* \add season\add*.
\v 13 As for Zenas ◄the lawyer\f + \ft Or: the \f* expert in the law► and Apollos,
\add when they are ready to leave Crete Island\add*, help them as much as you can in order that they may have everything \\f + \\ft litotes \\f*
that \add they need as they travel\add*. 
\v 14 Moreover, our \add fellow believers\add* also should learn ◄to devote themselves to
\add doing\f + \ft Or:  \f*\add*to constantly\add do\add*► good deeds \add for people\add* who need help in order that they, our fellow
believers, will live very useful \\f + \\ft litotes \\f* lives. 
\s Titus 3:15 
\s Everyone who is with me greets you and the other true believers there. May our Lord Jesus Christ continue to act kindly
toward all of you. 
\p
\v 15  \add As I finish this letter\add*, everyone who is with me ◄says that they are thinking affectionately about you\f + \ft Or: wants \f*
me to send greeting to you►. Tell those who are \add there\add* who love us and believe
\add as we do\add* that we ◄are thinking affectionately about\f + \ft Or: greet \f*► them. I pray\f + \ft Or: desire \f* that our Lord Jesus Christ will
continue to act kindly toward all of you.
