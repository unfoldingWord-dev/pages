\c 2  
\s Titus 2:1-10 
\s Teach and urge the believers to behave in a manner that is consistent with the correct teachings in order that people will
perceive that the teachings about God our Savior are very good. 
\p
\v 1 But as for you\add (sg)\add*, teach \add the believers\add* what agrees with the correct teachings.
\v 2  \add Specifically, tell\add* the older men that they should control themselves ◄in all situations\f + \ft Or: whatever \f* happens►,
\add that they should behave in such a manner\add* that all people will respect them, and that they should control what they
say and do. And tell them that they should firmly believe in the correct teachings, that they should sincerely love others, and
that they should always be steadfast. 
\v 3 Similarly, \add tell\add* the older women that they should behave ◄in a reverent manner that shows that they are devoted
to God\f + \ft Or: in \f* a manner that honors God►; \add specifically, they should\add* not ◄slander others\f + \ft Or: talk \f* evil about others►, and they
should not ◄be drinking much \add \f + \ft Or: habitually \f*\add* drinking► \add alcohol\add*. Tell them that they should teach
\add the younger women\add* what is good, 
\v 4 in order that they may love their husbands and love their children.
\v 5 They should teach them to control what they say and do and to be pure in every way, to be good workers at home and
submissive to their own husbands. \add The younger women should behave like
this\add* in order that no one will speak against the message about God.
\v 6 As for the younger men, similarly, urge them to control themselves
\add in all that they say and do\add*. 
\v 7 You yourself must continually do what is good in order that others will see how they should behave. Teach
\add the believers\add* sincerely and seriously; 
\v 8 teach what is correct and what no one can \add justly\add* criticize.
\add Do this\add* in order that \add when the believers\add* conduct their
lives\add in a proper manner\add*, anyone who opposes ◄\add us\f + \ft Or: our \f*
message\add*► will be disappointed because there will be nothing bad that they can
\add justly\add* say about us. 
\v 9 As for slaves, \add specifically, urge them\add* to be submissive to their masters in everything. They should please
\add their masters; specifically, they should not\add* ◄\add contradict\f + \ft Or: refuse \f* to
obey\add*► \add their masters\add*. 
\v 10 They should not steal \add things that belong to their masters\add*. Instead, they should always be completely
honest\f + \ft Or: reliable \f* and thus \add show their masters that their masters
can\add* completely trust them. They should behave like this in order that
\add as a result of all the slaves conducting themselves well, people\add* will realize that the teachings about God our Savior
are very desirable. 
\s Titus 2:11-14 
\s God very kindly sent Jesus Christ to earth in order that God might save all people and God graciously trains us to behave in
a godly manner. 
\p
\v 11  \add The believers should behave in a good manner\add*, since God did for us what we did not deserve,
\add sending Jesus Christ to earth\add* in order that he might save all people \\f + \\ft personification \\f*.
\v 12 God teaches\f + \ft Or: tells \f* us \\f + \\ft personification \\f* how to stop doing what he dislikes, and to stop desiring the things that ◄ungodly
people\f + \ft Or: people \f* who habitually do things that do not please God► desire \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f*. He wants us to control our behavior and to do what
is right and to do what pleases him while we live in this present age\f + \ft Or: time \f*.
\v 13  \add Do not forget that\add* we are waiting expectantly for that which will make us very happy
\add indeed\add* \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f*! We are expectantly waiting for our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ, to come gloriously!
\v 14 He is the one who \add willingly\add* gave himself ◄\add to die\f + \ft Or: as \f* a
sacrifice\add*► on our behalf to set us free from all sinful behavior! He wants ◄us to get rid of all our evil behavior\f + \ft Or: to \f* make
our lives pure► \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f*. He wants us, who are his very own people, to be
\add people who\add* are eager to do what is good. 
\s Titus 2:15 
\s With full authority, teach these things, urge the believers to do them, and correct those believers who do not follow them.
\p
\v 15 Teach \add the believers\add* these things! Urge \add them to do
them!\add* Correct \add those who do not obey them! As you do this, you have
my\add* full authority; so do not allow anyone to disregard you!
