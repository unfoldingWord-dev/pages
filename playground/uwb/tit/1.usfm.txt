\v 1 I, Paul, \add am writing this letter to you, Titus\add*. \add God appointed me to
be\add* his servant and \add to be\add* an apostle \add who represents\add* Jesus Christ.
\add God appointed me in order that I might teach\add* those whom God has chosen
\add to be his people\add* to \add correctly\add* believe \add in
him\add*. He wants me to teach them the true \add teachings about
God\add*, in order that they will learn to behave ◄in a \add godly
manner/\add*in a \add manner that pleases God\add*►. 
\v 2  \add As a result of my doing these things, they\add* confidently expect that God will cause them to live forever. God,
who never lies, promised before he created the world that \add his
people\add* would live forever. 
\v 3 Then at the time that he \add chose\add*, he revealed \add to us
his\add* message. \add Specifically\add*, God our Savior gave this message to me, and he trusted me to proclaim it to people.
\v 4 Titus, \add I am writing this letter\add* to \add you because you are
like\add* a true son \f + \fr metaphor \f* \add to me because I led/helped you to\add* believe the same
\add teachings about Christ that I do\add*. ◄\add I pray that/May\add*►
\add God our Father and Christ Jesus our Savior will continue to\add* act kindly toward you and cause you to have
\add inner\add* peace. 
\s Titus 1:5 
\s I want you to teach the believers and to appoint elders. 
\p
\v 5 When I \add asked you\add* to stay on Crete \add island\add*, I wanted you to do these things:
\add Teach the believers what they need to know so that they\add* can understand correctly the
\add spiritual\add* matters about which some are teaching wrongly. Appoint elders
\add in the congregation\add* in each town in the manner in which I told you to do.
\s Titus 1:6-9 
\s Appoint as elders men whom no one can justly criticize. 
\p
\v 6  \add When you appoint men as elders\add*, you must choose men whom no one can
\add justly\add* accuse of \add habitually\add* doing what is wrong (OR, whom everyone speaks well of). Specifically, appoint
men who have been faithful to their wives. Appoint men whose children faithfully obey
\add them. Do not appoint men whose children habitually\add* do all the things that their bodies urge them to do, or who refuse
to obey their parents. 
\v 7 Leaders \add of the congregation\add* must be \add men\add* who, as everyone knows, habitually do what is good (OR,
\add whom\add* no one can \add justly\add* accuse of doing what is wrong), because it is on God's behalf that they will
direct/serve \add the congregation. Specifically, they must\add* not be arrogant/proud. They must not easily become angry. They
must not \add be men who\add* drink much alcohol. They must not \add be men
who\add* ◄\add act\add* violently/fight► \add when they are angry. They
must\add* not \add be men who are\add* ◄greedy for/strongly desire to get► money.
\v 8 Instead, they must be ones who welcome and take care of guests. They must ◄be devoted to/like to do► what is good. They
must do \add what God considers\add* to be right. They must be ◄holy/completely dedicated to God►. They must be men who do what
their minds tell them is right to do \add and not what their emotions/desires urge them to
do\add*. 
\v 9 They must firmly believe in the message \add about Jesus Christ\add* exactly as
\add I/we(inc)\add* taught it, in order that they might be able to teach
\add the believers\add* what is correct and to urge \add them to follow it well. If they firmly accept our
message\add*, they will be able to convince those who oppose \add what is correct that they are
wrong\add*. 
\s Titus 1:10-16 
\s Since there are many deceivers teaching what is false, who do not even know God themselves and are unable to do any good
thing, rigorously convince those believers who follow false teachings that they are wrong in order that they will firmly
believe in the correct teachings. 
\p
\v 10  \add I say this\add* because there are many \add people who oppose the correct
teachings\add*. They refuse to obey people who have authority over them, they talk
◄\add on and on/without stopping\add*►, saying what helps no one, and they deceive people. The Jewish
\add believers\add* \f + \fr metonymy \f* \add who insist we must obey all the Jewish rituals
are\add* especially\add doing this\add*. 
\v 11  \add You and the leaders whom you appoint\add* should prevent such people from teaching
\add the believers\add*. They are causing whole families to stop believing in the correct teachings \f + \fr metaphor \f* by means of their
teaching \add people wrong ideas/teachings. They are teaching people
only\add* in order that people will give them money, \add which is
very\add* shameful \add for them to do\add*. 
\v 12 A man from Crete \add island\add* whom \add they consider\add* a prophet said,
“\add My fellow\add* Cretan people are always lying \add to one another! They are like
dangerous\add* wild animals \f + \fr metaphor \f*! They are lazy and always eat too much food \f + \fr synecdoche \f*!”
\v 13 The words that this man said \add about the Cretan people\add* are
\add still\add* true, \add especially about their being liars\add*. So, rigorously convince/show
\add those Cretan believers\add* that those \add false teachings\add* are wrong. Tell them to
\add firmly\add* believe in the correct teachings. 
\v 14  \add Teach them that\add* they should no \add longer\add* listen to the stories that the Jews ◄made up/invented►.
\add Especially\add* they should refuse to obey those who reject our true teachings, because those people are teaching things
that only come from human beings, \add not from God\add*. 
\v 15  \add Believers should reject\add* what they teach about food\add ,
because\add* no \add food that we eat\add* can make us unacceptable to God if we are pure
\add in our\add* ◄\add inner beings/hearts\add*►. But if people are evil
\add within themselves\add* and they do not trust \add in Christ
Jesus\add*, there is no \add ritual\add* that can make them acceptable to God. Such people's way of thinking has been ruined
{Such people have ruined their way of thinking}, and they do not even feel guilty
\add when they do what is evil\add*. 
\v 16 Even though they claim/say that they know God, by what they do they
\add show that they\add* do not know ◄God/his true teaching►. They do not obey
\add God\add*, and they are unable to do anything that he considers to be
good\add . So God considers them to be absolutely\add* disgusting!
