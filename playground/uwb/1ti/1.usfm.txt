\v 1  \add I\add*, Paul, \add am writing this letter. You know that\add* I am an apostle. I
\add represent\add* Christ Jesus because God and Christ Jesus commanded me to do it. God is the one who saved us, and Jesus is
the one for whom we are confidently waiting \add to return\add*,
\v 2  \add You\add*, Timothy, \add are like\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f* a true son
\add to me\add* because \add you\add* trusted \add in Christ after I told you about
him\add*. 
\p \add I pray/desire that\add* God, who is our Father, and Christ Jesus, who is our Lord, will
\add continue to act\add* kindly and mercifully to you, and \add that they will give you
inner\add* peace. 
\s 1 Timothy 1:3-20 
\s Defend and promote the true Christian doctrine. Teach it and live by it. Also I instruct you how to strengthen the
congregation, which upholds the truth. 
\p
\v 3  \add I urge you now\add*, just like I urged you when I was going to Macedonia
\add province\add*, that you remain there in Ephesus \add city\add*. Stay there so that you may command certain persons
\add who teach other believers\add* that they not teach false \add doctrines/teachings\add*.
\v 4 And tell people to not continually give their attention to stories
\add that tell about our ancestors\add*, stories in which there are ◄genealogies/lists of our ancestors' names► that
\add seem to be\add* endless. \add You must command your congregation not to think that these stories are
valuable\add*, because \add whenever people think\add* that, they
\add just\add* start arguing about things uselessly, instead of \add teaching\add* God's plan, which
\add is concerned with\add* what we believe \f + \fr (OR, which \add we know
because\add* we trust \add in Christ\add*). 
\v 5  \add Teach them\add* to have pure desires \f + \fr metonymy \f* and \add thus to know within themselves that
God\add* approves of what they do, and to sincerely believe \add the true
teaching\add*. By doing that, \add they will\add* love \add God well\add*.
\v 6 There are some people who have turned away from these true teachings. As a result, they
\add just\add* discuss what is useless. 
\v 7 They desire to teach the laws \add that God gave to Moses\add*, but they do not understand what they are really saying nor
the things about which they ◄confidently speak/say that they understand well►.
\p
\v 8 We know that the laws \add that God gave to Moses are\add* good if people consider correctly
\add what God intended them for\add*. 
\v 9 We must remember that God did not give Moses those laws in order
\add to condemn\add* righteous people. By those laws he \add condemns people who act as though there were
no\add* laws and who refuse to obey \add anyone. He condemns\add* those who do not revere God and those who sin habitually.
\add By them he condemns\add* those who refuse to perform rituals that are pleasing to God and who show no respect for
religion. \add He condemns\add* those who murder their fathers and who murder their mothers and who murder
\add other\add* people. 
\v 10  \add He condemns\add* those who are sexually immoral and those who are homosexuals.
\add He condemns\add* those who kidnap/steal people \add in order to make them
slaves\add*. \add He condemns\add* those who lie and those who promise something strongly but do not do what they promised. He
condemns every other action that is contrary to our true teaching.
\v 11 This is what we teach people when we tell them the glorious/wonderful message about Christ that our awesome God
\add has revealed\add* and that he gave to me to teach. 
\p
\v 12 I am grateful to Christ Jesus our Lord who enabled me to do this work, because he considered that I could be trusted. So
he appointed me in order that I \add would serve him\add*. 
\v 13 Formerly I said evil things \add about him\add*, I caused \add his
people\add* to suffer, and I acted very cruelly toward them. But
\add Christ acted\add* kindly to me since I ◄acted ignorantly/did not know that I was doing wrong► because I did not believe
\add in him\add*. 
\v 14 Our Lord kindly did for me what I did not deserve, so that I now believe
\add in Christ Jesus\add* and I love others (OR, him) \f* \add because I belong to
him\add*. 
\p
\v 15  \add Something that all we believers\add* say is certainly true and is worthy for us to fully accept is that Christ
Jesus came into the world in order to save sinful people \add so that God would not punish them for their
sins\add*. As for me, I \add consider that I have sinned\add* more than all others.
\v 16 Yet Christ Jesus acted mercifully to me in order that he might demonstrate
\add to people that he is perfectly patient with them\add*. He did that by his being patient with me, one who has sinned worse
than all the others. He wanted what he did for me ◄to be an example/to demonstrate his patience► to people who would
\add later\add* believe in him and as a result would live forever.
\p
\v 17 I desire that people will honor and praise the only \add true\add* God forever! Even though no one can see him, he is the
King who rules for all time, who will never die! ◄Amen!/That is true!►
\v 18 Timothy, you \add are like\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f* a son \add to me\add*. So, ◄based on/in accordance with► what
\add someone\add* previously ◄prophesied/told what God revealed to them► about you, I am instructing you
\add to strongly oppose those who teach false doctrines/teachings. You should oppose them
like\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f* a soldier ◄fights strongly against/opposes► \add those who attack his
countrymen\add*. 
\v 19 Continue to believe \add the true teaching\add* and do only what you know to be right! Remember that some people have
◄pushed aside/rejected► the true teaching. As a result, they no longer believe \f + \fr metaphor \f* what is true.
\v 20 Among the ones who have done that are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I put in the hands of Satan, in order that
\add when Satan punishes them\add* they may learn not to teach wrong teaching.
