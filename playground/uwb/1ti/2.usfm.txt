\c 2  
\s 1 Timothy 2:1-3:16 
\s I instruct you how people should conduct themselves who belong to God's family and who uphold the truth.
\p
\v 1 The first (OR, most important) thing that I urge \add you to tell your
congregation\add* is that \add Christians\add* should continually ask
\add God\add* for \add what they need\add*. They should also pray to God
\add for all other people\add*, and they should be thanking \add God\add*.
\v 2 Specifically, they should pray for rulers and for all \add other
people\add* who ◄are in important government positions/have authority►, in order that
\add God will help them to rule\add*. \add As God enables the rulers to rule
well\add*, we can live very peaceably as we conduct ours lives doing all that God and others consider to be right and proper.
\v 3 It is good \add to pray like that, and\add* it pleases God, who saves us, when we pray like that.
\v 4 He desires to save all people. He wants everyone to fully know
\add and accept\add* his true \add message\add*. 
\v 5 He is the \add only\add* one \add true\add* God! And there is
\add only\add* one person who talks to God on behalf of people. That person is Christ Jesus, who
\add himself\add* is a man! 
\v 6 He gave ◄his \add life/himself\add*► \add as a sacrifice\add* in order to ransom/redeem all
\add people\add*, which showed at the proper time \add that God desires that all people be
saved\add* {\add to save all people\add*}. 
\v 7 As for \bd me\bd*, he appointed me to declare \add this message\add* and to be an apostle. I am telling the truth
\add about God appointing me\add*. I am not lying! He appointed me to teach the non-Jews that they should believe God's true
message. 
\p
\v 8 I desire that in every place \add where believers worship\add*, the men who pray publicly \f + \fr metonymy \f* should be men who are not
practicing sin. When they pray, they should not be angry \add with
anyone\add* and they should not doubt \add that God will answer\add* their prayers (OR, should not quarrel with anyone).
\v 9  \add I would like that\add* the clothing that women wear be ◄modest and sensible/proper and appropriate► \f + \fr doublet \f*. I want
them to not fix their hair in fancy/elaborate ways, nor wear gold
\add jewelry\add*, nor pearls, nor expensive clothing \add in order that they may make themselves
attractive\add*. 
\v 10 Instead, they should be doing things that women who ◄claim to/say that they► worship God should do; that is, they should
be doing good deeds. 
\v 11 Women must learn to \add listen\add* quietly \add during the worship
services\add* and to fully subject themselves \add to the leaders of the
congregation\add*. 
\v 12 I do not permit women to teach \add men spiritual truth publicly\add*, and I do not permit them to have authority over
men. Instead, \add I desire\add* that women \add listen\add* quietly
\add during the worship services\add*. 
\v 13 Keep in mind that God made Adam first, and afterwards he made Eve,
\v 14 and that it was not Adam whom \add Satan\add* deceived. As a result of the woman being deceived, she sinned. She did what
God had told her not to do. 
\v 15 But even though she did that, now women will be saved {God will accept women} as they bear children if they continue to
trust \add God\add* and if they continue to love others, and if they continue to conduct their lives
\add more and more\add* ◄acceptably to God/like God wants them to►, and if they continue to be modest.
