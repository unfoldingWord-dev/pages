\v 1 Anyone who aspires to be an elder \add in the congregation\add* \f + \ft Or: a bishop) desires a noble\f + \ft Or: honorable \f* task.
\v 2  \add Since that is a task that others should respect\add*, an overseer must
\add conduct himself\add* in such a way that \add no one\add* can truly say that he has done
\add anything that is\add* wrong\f + \ft Or: find fault with him \f*. Specifically,
\add he must be\add* faithful to his wife. He must think clearly
\add about what he does\add*. He must be able to control his behavior. He must be sensible. He must be dignified\f + \ft Or: respectable \f*.
He must welcome and care for guests. He must be able to teach \add God's
truth\add* well. 
\v 3 He must not be a drunkard. He must not be ready\f + \ft Or: quick \f* to fight
\add those who make him angry\add*. On the contrary, he must be gentle and he must not be quarrelsome. He must not be greedy
for much money. 
\v 4 He must lead and care for his own household\f + \ft Or: family \f* well. For example, he must be a man whom his children obey and
completely respect, 
\v 5 because if anyone does not know how he should lead well and care for well the people who live in his own house, he
certainly cannot care for God's congregation!\f + \ft Or: how can he care for God's congregation? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 6 He must not be one who has just recently \add trusted in Jesus\add*, because
\add if you choose a man\add* like that he might become conceited\f + \ft Or: proud \f*
\add because you chose him so soon\add*. As a result of his being conceited\f + \ft Or: proud \f*, God will condemn him like he condemned the
devil \add because he was conceited\f + \ft Or: proud \f*\add*. 
\v 7 Moreover, \add an elder must conduct himself\add* in such a way that non-Christians speak well of him, because
\add if he conducts himself like\add* that, people will not reproach\f + \ft Or: say evil things about \f* him, and the devil will not
capture\f + \ft Or: trap \f* him \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add like people capture animals\add* in a trap.
\p
\v 8  \add Those whom you choose to serve as\add* deacons likewise
\add must be ones who conduct themselves suitably\f + \ft Or: appropriately \f*.
Specifically\add*, they must be serious\f + \ft Or: worthy that people respect them►. They must ◄be sincere, Or: mean what they say \f*. They must
not like to drink much alcohol. They must not be greedy\f + \ft Or: have a strong desire to get money \f*.
\v 9 They must sincerely believe the message that \add God\add* has now revealed
\add to us\add*. 
\v 10  \add Like you do for the elders\add*, you must examine ◄\add their character\f + \ft Or: how \f* they conduct their
lives\add*► \add before you appoint them to serve\add*. Then if they are without fault, let them serve as deacons.
\v 11 Their wives (OR, The women who are deacons) likewise \add must conduct themselves suitably\f + \ft Or: appropriately \f*. Specifically,
they must be\add* serious\f + \ft Or: worthy that people respect them \f*. They must not speak evil about people. They must not drink much
alcohol. They must be faithful in everything that they do. 
\v 12 Deacons must be faithful to their wives, and they must lead well and care well for their children and
\add the rest of\add* the people in their houses. 
\v 13 Because if deacons serve well, people will respect them and they will be able
\add to speak\add* very boldly\f + \ft Or: confidently \f* about what they believe concerning Christ Jesus.
\p
\v 14 Although I hope that I will come to you soon, I am writing these things to you
\add now\add* 
\v 15 in order that if I am delayed\f + \ft Or: things prevent me from coming to you soon \f*, you will know how believers should conduct
their lives \add and you will be able to teach that to them\add*.
\add I am talking about\add* all those who are members of God's family, all the congregations that belong to the all-powerful
God, all those who uphold\f + \ft Or: support \f* \f + \ft metaphor \f* the true \add message\add*.
\v 16 It is certainly true that \add the message that God\add* has now revealed is very wonderful! From it, we learn this
spiritual truth that we say\f + \ft Or: sing \f* about \add Christ\add* (OR, We affirm this teaching to be true and very important.) It is what
shows us how to live in a godly manner\f + \ft Or: in a manner that pleases God \f*. It is what God has now revealed, even though it was not
known before\add . We\add* \add affirm\f + \ft Or: say that it is true\add* \f* concerning Jesus Christ that,
\q He is the one who appeared on the earth in a human body. 
\q God's Spirit showed\f + \ft Or: demonstrated \f* that he is\f + \ft Or: was \f* truly the Messiah (OR, that he always acted righteously \f*;
\q Angels saw him; people preached about him in many nations; 
\q People in many parts of the world believed the message about him.
\q God took him up into heaven.
