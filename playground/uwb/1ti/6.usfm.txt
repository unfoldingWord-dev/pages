\c 6  
\s 1 Timothy 6:1-21 
\s Live according to the Christian doctrine and complete what I have commanded.
\p
\v 1 As for slaves \f + \ft doublet \f* \add who are believers, teach them that
they\add* should consider that it is right for them to honor their masters in every way. If they do that, people will not speak
against\f + \ft Or: evil about► God ( metonymy ) and they will not speak ◄against, Or: evil about \f* that which
\add we apostles\add* teach, \add because they will see that the slaves are being respectful of their
masters\add*. 
\p
\v 2  \add Slaves\add* who have masters who believe \add in Christ\add* must not be disrespectful to their masters just because
their masters are fellow believers. Instead, they should serve \add their
masters\add* even better because \add their masters\add* are fellow believers whom
\add God\add* loves and who benefit when \add the slaves\add* serve them well.
\p As you teach these things \add to your congregation\add*, exhort\f + \ft Or: urge \f*
\add people\add* that they do them. 
\p
\v 3 Some people teach things that are different. What they teach does not agree with\f + \ft Or: is not like \f* the correct teaching that
our Lord Jesus Christ \add taught\add* \f + \ft Or: that is about our Lord Jesus Christ). They do not say that we should conduct our
lives ◄in a \add godly manner\f + \ft Or:  \f*\add*in a \add manner that pleases
God\add*►. 
\v 4 Such people are very proud and do not understand anything \f + \ft hyperbole \f*. Instead, they abnormally\f + \ft Or: wrongly \f* desire to
\add argue about unimportant\add* matters and about certain words. As a result,
\add people who listen to them\add* envy \add others\f + \ft Or: \add*desire to have what others have \f*. They quarrel
\add with others and with one another\add*. They say bad things about
\add others. They\add* suspect\f + \ft Or: think \f* that \add others\add* have evil
\add motives\f + \ft Or: reasons for doing what they do\add* \f*. 
\v 5 Their whole way of thinking has become completely wrong \add because\add* they have rejected the true
\add doctrine\f + \ft Or: teaching \f*\add*. As a result, they \add mistakenly\add* think that ◄by practicing religion\f + \ft Or: by \f* saying that they
believe in God► they will gain a lot of \add money\add*. 
\p
\v 6  \add Well, we\add* truly do gain great \add benefit\add* when we conduct our lives in a
\add godly manner\f + \ft Or: \add*in a \add manner that pleases God\add* \f* and we are content
\add with what we have\add*. 
\v 7 We brought nothing into the world \add when we were born\add*, and we cannot take anything out
\add of it when we die\add*, 
\v 8 so if we have food and clothing, we should be satisfied with these.
\v 9 But some people strongly desire to be rich. As a result, they
\add do wrong things to get money, and this will cause them to\add* be caught\f + \ft Or: trapped \f* \f + \ft metaphor \f* as animals get caught in traps.
They foolishly desire many things, and those desires cause them to get hurt. And God will completely reject
\add them!\add* 
\v 10 All kinds of bad things will happen to people who \f + \ft personification \f* desire to have a lot of money. Because some people longed for
money, they have stopped believing the doctrine\f + \ft Or: teaching \f* \add that all of us
believe\add* and they have caused themselves much grief\f + \ft Or: sadness \f*.
\p
\v 11 But as for you, who are a man who \add serves God\add*, ◄keep completely away from such love of money\f + \ft Or: do \f* not be like the
people who love money►. Decide that you will do what is right, and that you will be godly\f + \ft Or: do what pleases God \f*. Decide that
you will trust \add God\add*, and that you will love \add others\add*. Endure
\add difficult circumstances\add*. Always be gentle \add with people\add*.
\v 12 Try earnestly and with all your energy\f + \ft Or: strength \f* \f + \ft metaphor \f* to live in accordance with what you believe.
\add Continue to do your tasks well in order that\add* you will know for sure that you will live eternally. Remember that
\add God\add* chose you to \add live with him\add*, and that when many elders were listening you said strongly
\add what you believe\f + \ft Or: that you trust in Christ\add* \f*. 
\p
\v 13 God, who gives life to all things, knows everything that you do. Christ Jesus also knows everything that you do. He
strongly declared what was true when \add he was on trial before\add* Pontius Pilate.
\v 14 I command you that as you keep all that in mind, in every way you hold fast\f + \ft Or: obey \f* what Christ has commanded us \f + \ft doublet \f*.
Hold fast\f + \ft Or: obey \f* those teachings in a way that our Lord Jesus Christ cannot ◄criticize you about, Or: say that you did what is
wrong►, until he comes again. 
\v 15  \add Remember that God\add* will cause Jesus to come again at the proper time. He is awesome! He is the only Ruler! He
rules over all other people who rule! 
\v 16 He is the only one who will never die, \add and he lives in heaven
in\add* light \add that is so bright that\add* no one can approach it! He is the one whom no person has ever seen and whom no
person is able to see! My desire is that all people will honor him and that he
\add will rule\add* powerfully \f + \ft metonymy \f* forever! May it be so!\f + \ft Or: Amen! \f*
\p
\v 17 Tell \add the believers\add* who are rich here in this present world that they should not be proud, and that they should
not trust in their many \add possessions\add*, because they cannot be certain
\add how long they will have them\add*. Teach them that they should
not\add trust in their wealth. Instead, they should trust\add* in God. He is the one who abundantly gives us everything we have
in order that we may enjoy it. 
\v 18 Also, tell them that their good deeds must be as plentiful
\add as their money\add*. Specifically, they should share very generously with others
\add what they have\add*. 
\v 19 If they do that, \add Jesus will give them a great reward. It will be as
though\add* they are storing up \add in heaven\add* much treasure for themselves that will be a good
\add basis on which they may rely\add* for\f + \ft Or: result in their \f* receiving a great reward in the future (OR, which will be
\add as\add* solid\add as\add* the foundation \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add of a house\add*). By doing this they will have the life that is the
real life. 
\p
\v 20 Timothy, faithfully proclaim\f + \ft Or: protect \f* the true message (OR, do the work \f* that
\add Jesus\add* has given \add to you\add*. Avoid\f + \ft Or: Do not listen to \f*
\add people who want to\add* chatter about things that are not important to God. Avoid\f + \ft Or: Do not listen to \f*
\add people who claim\f + \ft Or: say \f* that they have\add* ‘true knowledge’ but who say things that oppose\f + \ft Or: contradict \f*
\add our true teaching\add*. 
\v 21 \add Keep completely away from\f + \ft Or: Reject completely\add* \f* \add such teaching. Remember
that\add* some people who claim \add to have this ‘knowledge’\add* have stopped believing what
\add all of us\add* believe. 
\p \add I desire that\f + \ft Or: May\add* \f* \add God continue to act\add* kindly toward you all.
