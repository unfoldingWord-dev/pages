\c 13  
\s Moses warned them against idolatry 
\p
\v 1 “Possibly there will be people among you who \add say that they
are\add* prophets. They may say that they are able to interpret the meaning of dreams or perform various kinds of miracles
\\f + \\ft doublet \\f*. 
\v 2 They will say those things in order to induce\f + \ft Or: persuade \f* you to worship gods that you have never known about before. But
even if what they predict happens, 
\v 3 do not pay attention to what they say. Yahweh our God will be testing you to find out if you love him with all your inner
being. 
\v 4 You must conduct your lives as Yahweh our God wants you to, and you must have an awesome respect for him, and do what he
tells you to do \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f*, and worship only him, and ◄be faithful to\f + \ft Or: have \f* a close relationship with► him.
\p
\v 5 But you must execute anyone who \add falsely says that he is\add* a prophet, or someone who
\add falsely\add* says that he can interpret dreams, or who tells you to rebel against Yahweh our God, who rescued your
ancestors from being slaves in Egypt. People like that are only wanting to cause you to stop conducting your lives as Yahweh
has commanded you to do. Execute them, to get rid of this evil among you.
\v 6 It does not matter if even your brother or your daughter or your wife or some close\f + \ft Or: dear \f* friend secretly urges you, saying
‘Let's worship other gods,’ gods which you or your ancestors have never known about.
\v 7 Some of them may encourage you to worship gods that people-groups that live near you worship, or gods that groups who live
far away worship. 
\v 8 Do not \\f + \\ft synecdoche \\f* do what they suggest. No not even listen to them. Do not even act mercifully toward them, and do not keep
secret what they have done. 
\v 9 Execute them! You be the first one to \add throw stones at them
to\add* kill them, and then let everyone else \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* throw stones at them, too.
\v 10 Kill such people by throwing stones at them, because they are trying to cause you to stop worshiping Yahweh our God, who
rescued your ancestors from being slaves in Egypt. 
\v 11 When they are executed, all the Israeli people will hear \add what
happened\add*, and they will become afraid, and none of them will do such an evil thing again.
\p
\v 12 When you are living in one of the towns in the land that Yahweh our God is giving to you, you may hear
\v 13 that some worthless people among you [IDI] are deceiving the people of their town, saying, ‘Let's go and worship other
gods,’ but they are gods that you have never heard about before.
\v 14 Inquire about it thoroughly\f + \ft Or: carefully \f*. If \add you find out
that\add* it is true that such a disgraceful thing has happened,
\v 15 kill all the people in that town. And kill all their livestock, too. Destroy the town completely.
\v 16 Gather all the possessions that belonged to the people who lived there and pile them up in the city plaza. Then burn the
town and everything in it, as though it was an offering to Yahweh that would be completely burned
\add on the altar\add*. The ruins\f + \ft Or: ashes \f* must stay there forever; the town must never be rebuilt.
\v 17 You must not take for yourselves [IDI] anything that Yahweh has said must be destroyed, because if you do what I say,
Yahweh will stop being angry with you, and he will act mercifully toward you. And he will cause you to have many
children\f + \ft Or: descendants \f*, which is what he promised our ancestors that he would do.
\v 18 Yahweh our God will do all those things if you do what he is telling you to do, and if you obey all the commandments that
I am giving to you today and do what Yahweh says is right \add for you to
do\add*.”
