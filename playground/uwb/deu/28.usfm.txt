\c 28  
\s The blessings from obeying God 
\p
\v 1 “If you do what Yahweh our God tells you to do and faithfully obey everything that I am today commanding you to do, he
will cause you to become greater than any other nation on the earth.
\v 2 If you obey Yahweh, this is what he will do to bless you: 
\pi
\v 3 He will bless everything that you do when you are in the cities
\pi and he will bless every thing that you do when you are \add working\add* in the fields.
\pi
\v 4 He will bless you by giving you many children [IDI] and by giving you abundant crops, and plenty of cattle and sheep.
\pi
\v 5 He will bless you by giving you plenty of grain \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* to make bread.
\pi
\v 6 He will bless you \add everywhere\add*—when you go out \add of your
houses\add* and when you come into \add your houses\add*. 
\pi
\v 7 Yahweh will enable you to defeat \add the armies of\add* your enemies;
\pi they will attack you from one direction, but they will run away from you in seven\f + \ft Or: many \f* directions.
\pi
\v 8 Yahweh will bless you \add by filling\add* your barns \add with
grain\add*, and he will bless all the work that you do; 
\pi he will bless you in the land that he is giving to you. 
\p
\v 9 If you obey all the commandments that Yahweh our God \add has given to
you\add* and if you conduct your lives as he wants you to do, he will continue to cause you to be his people, which is what he
promised. 
\p
\v 10 Then all the people-groups on the earth will realize that you belong to \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* Yahweh, and they will be afraid of you.
\p
\v 11 And Yahweh will cause you to prosper very much. He will give you many children [IDI], many cattle, and abundant crops in
the land that he solemnly promised to our ancestors that he would give to you.
\p
\v 12 At the time that rain is needed, Yahweh will send it from where he stores it in the sky, and he will bless all your work,
with the result that you \add will be able to\add* lend money to many other nations, but you will not need to borrow
\add money from them\add*. 
\p
\v 13 If you faithfully obey all of the commands of Yahweh our God that I am giving you today, Yahweh will cause your nation to
be superior [IDI] \add to other nations\add*, not inferior to them; You will always be prosperous and you will never be
needy\f + \ft Or: poor \f* [IDI]. 
\p
\v 14  \add Yahweh will do all these things for you\add* if you do not turn away from
\add obeying\add* what I am commanding you today, and if you never worship or serve other gods.
\s The curses from disobeying God 
\p
\v 15 But if you do not do what Yahweh our God is telling you to do, and if you do not faithfully obey all his rules and
regulations that I am giving to you today, this is what he will do to curse you:
\pi
\v 16 He will curse you when you are in the cities 
\pi and he will curse you when you are \add working\add* in the fields.
\pi
\v 17 He will curse you by not giving you much grain \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* to make bread.
\pi
\v 18 He will curse you by giving you only a few children [IDI], giving you poor crops, and by not giving you many cattle and
sheep. 
\pi
\v 19 He will curse you \add everywhere\add*—when you go out of \add your
houses\add* and when you come into \add your houses\add*. 
\p
\v 20 If you do evil things and reject Yahweh, 
\pi he will curse you by causing you to ◄be confused\f + \ft Or: not \f* know what to do►, and to be frustrated in all that you do,
\pi until \add your enemies\add* quickly and completely destroy you {you will be quickly and completely destroyed}.
\pi
\v 21 Yahweh will send terrible diseases on you, 
\pi until not one of you remains alive in the land that you are about to enter and occupy.
\pi
\v 22 Yahweh will strike\f + \ft Or: afflict \f* you with diseases that shrivel your bodies, with fever, with inflammation\f + \ft Or: swelling \f*.
\pi It will be extremely hot, and it will not rain. 
\pi There will be scorching winds, and \add he will cause\add* your crops to rot.
\pi All these things will strike you until you die. 
\pi
\v 23 No rain \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* will fall from the sky, \add with the result
that\add* the ground will be \add as hard as\add* iron \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f*. 
\pi
\v 24 Instead of sending rain, Yahweh will send strong winds to blow sand and dust over your land, until your land is ruined.
\pi
\v 25 Yahweh will enable your enemies to defeat you; 
\pi your soldiers will attack them from one direction, but they will run away from them in seven\f + \ft Or: many \f* directions,
\pi and when the people of other nations see what is happening to you, they will say that it is horrible.
\pi
\v 26  \add You will die\add*, and birds and wild animals will come and eat your corpses,
\pi and there will not be anyone to scare\f + \ft Or: shoo \f* them away. 
\pi
\v 27 Yahweh will cause you to have boils on your skin, like he caused the people of Egypt to have
\add many years ago\add*. 
\pi He will cause you to have tumors, open sores, and your skin will itch, but there will be nothing that will cure those
diseases. 
\pi
\v 28 Yahweh will cause \add some of\add* you to become insane; he will cause some of you to become blind, and he will cause
\add some of\add* your minds to become confused. 
\pi
\v 29  \add Because you will not be able to see where you are going\add*, at midday you will ◄grope\f + \ft Or: feel \f* your way► around with
your hands, like people do in the darkness. 
\pi You will not prosper in anything that you do. 
\pi You will continually be oppressed and robbed, and there will not be anyone to help you.
\pi
\v 30 Some of you men will be engaged\f + \ft Or: promised \f* to marry a young woman, but someone else will marry her.
\pi You will build houses, but you will never live in them. 
\pi You will plant grapevines, but you will not eat the grapes; \add someone else will eat
them\add*. 
\pi
\v 31 Your enemies will butcher your cattle while you watch them, and you will not get any of the meat to eat.
\pi They will drag away your donkeys while you watch them do it, and they will not give them back to you.
\pi They will take away your sheep; and there will not be anyone to help you
\add rescue them\add*. 
\pi
\v 32 While you watch, your sons and daughters will be given to foreigners to become their slaves. Every day you will watch for
your children to return, but ◄you will watch in vain\f + \ft Or: they \f* will never return►.
\pi
\v 33 People from a foreign nation will take all the crops that you worked hard to produce,
\pi and they will constantly treat you harshly and cruelly \\f + \\ft doublet \\f*.
\pi
\v 34 The result will be that all these terrible things that you see\f + \ft Or: experience \f* will cause you to become insane.
\pi
\v 35 Yahweh will cause your legs \add to be covered with\add* painful boils that cannot be healed,
\pi and you will have boils from the bottom of your feet to the top of your head.
\pi
\v 36 Yahweh will cause your king and the rest of you to be taken to another country, to a place in which you and your
ancestors have never lived, 
\pi and there you will worship and serve gods that are made of wood or stone.
\pi
\v 37 When the people-groups in nearby countries see what has happened to you, they will be shocked\f + \ft Or: horrified \f*;
\pi they will taunt\f + \ft Or: ridicule \f* [IDI] you and make fun of you. 
\pi
\v 38 You will plant plenty of seeds in your fields, but you will reap only a small harvest, because locusts will eat the
crops. 
\pi
\v 39 You will plant grapevines and take care of them, but you will not pick any grapes to make wine, because worms will eat
the vines. 
\pi
\v 40 Olive trees will grow everywhere in your land, but you will not get any olive oil to rub on your skin because the olives
will drop on \add the ground before they are ripe\add*. 
\pi
\v 41 You will have sons and daughters, but they will not stay with you, because they will be captured and taken away.
\pi
\v 42 Swarms of locusts\f + \ft Or: insects \f* will eat your crops and \add the leaves
of\add* all your trees. 
\pi
\v 43 Foreigners who live in your land will become more and more
\add powerful\add*, and you will become less and less \add powerful\add*.
\pi
\v 44 They will have \add money\add* to lend to you, but you will not have any money to lend to them.
\pi They will be superior [IDI] to you, and you will be inferior to them [IDI].
\p
\v 45 All these disasters will happen to you and continue to happen to you until you are destroyed, if you do not do what
Yahweh your God told you to do, and do not obey all the rules and regulations that he gave to you.
\p
\v 46 These disasters will solemnly warn \\f + \\ft doublet \\f* you and your descendants forever
\add what happens to groups who disobey Yahweh\add*. 
\p
\v 47 Because Yahweh blessed you abundantly in many ways, you should have served him very joyfully \\f + \\ft doublet \\f*, but you did not do
that. 
\p
\v 48 Therefore, you will work for the enemies whom Yahweh will send to attack you. You will be hungry and thirsty; you will
not have clothes to wear; and you will lack everything else that you need. And Yahweh will cause you to become slaves \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* and
work hard until he gets rid of you. 
\p
\v 49 Yahweh will bring against you an army from very far away \\f + \\ft hyperbole \\f*, soldiers who speak a language that you do not
know\f + \ft Or: understand \f*. They will swoop down on you \add quickly\add* like an eagle \\f + \\ft simile \\f*.
\v 50 They will be fierce looking. They will not act mercifully toward anyone, not even young children and old people.
\v 51 They will \add kill and\add* eat your livestock, and they will eat your crops, and you will ◄starve\f + \ft Or: die \f* because you do
not have anything to eat►. They will not leave for you any grain or wine or
\add olive\add* oil or cattle or sheep; and you will all die \add from
hunger\add*. 
\v 52 Your enemies will surround your towns throughout the land that Yahweh your God is about to give to you, and they will
break down the high and strong walls \add around your towns\add*, walls which you trusted\f + \ft Or: thought \f* would protect you.
\p
\v 53 When your enemies are surrounding \add your towns\add*, you will be extremely hungry, with the result that you will eat
the flesh of your own sons and daughters that Yahweh your God has given to you.
\v 54-55 When your enemies have surrounded your towns, even the most gentle and sensitive men among you will want food very
desperately, with the result that they will \add kill their own children
and\add* eat their flesh, because they will not have anything else to eat. They will not even share any of it with their
brothers or wives whom they love very much or with any of their other children who are still alive.
\v 56-57 Even the most gentle and sensitive\f + \ft Or: kind \f* women among you, who are very refined\f + \ft Or: rich \f* with the result that they have
never been forced to walk anywhere \\f + \\ft hyperbole \\f*, will do the same thing. When your enemies have surrounded your towns, those women
will be extremely hungry, with the result that after they give birth to a child, they will secretly
\add kill the baby and\add* eat its flesh and also eat the afterbirth. And they will not share any of it with their husbands
who they love very much or with any of their other children. 
\p
\v 58 If you do not faithfully obey all of the laws that I am writing, and if you do not have an awesome respect for Yahweh our
glorious God \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f*, 
\v 59 he will \add punish you by\add* sending on you and on your descendants great afflictions and plagues which will last for
many years. 
\v 60 He will bring on you the plagues that he sent on the people of Egypt, and you will never be healed.
\v 61 He will also send on you many other sicknesses and diseases that I have not talked about in these laws, until you all
will die. 
\v 62 You became as numerous as the stars in the sky, but only a few of you will remain alive, if you do not obey Yahweh your
God. 
\v 63 Yahweh was very happy to do good things for you and to cause you to become very numerous, but now he will be happy to
ruin you and get rid of you. \add Those of you who do not die from these
plagues\add* will be snatched away from the land that you will soon be entering to possess.
\p
\v 64 Yahweh will scatter you among many people-groups, all over the earth, and in those areas\f + \ft Or: places \f* you will serve other gods
that are made of wood or stone, gods which you and your ancestors have never known\f + \ft Or: worshiped \f*.
\v 65 In those areas you will not have any peace\f + \ft Or: safety \f* or rest. Yahweh will cause you to be constantly worried\f + \ft Or: anxious \f*, feel
hopeless, and be discouraged. 
\v 66 You will always be afraid that your enemies will kill you. You will be very fearful, all day and all night.
\v 67 Because you will be very fearful\f + \ft Or: afraid \f* and because you will
\add very distressed\add* because of the \add terrible\add* things that you see, each morning you will say ‘I wish it were
evening already!’ and each evening you will say ‘I wish it were morning already!’
\v 68 Yahweh will send \add some of\add* you back to Egypt in ships, even though he promised that you would never
\add be forced to\add* go there again. There in Egypt you will try to sell yourselves to become slaves of your enemies
\add in order to have food to eat\add*, but no one will buy you.
\add All those things will happen to you if you do not obey the laws that Yahweh is giving to
you\add*.”
