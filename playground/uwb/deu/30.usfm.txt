\c 30  
\s Bringing them back to Israel 
\p
\v 1 “I have now told you about the ways that Yahweh our God will bless you
\add if you obey him\add* and the ways that he will curse you \add if you disobey
him\add*. I am saying that you must choose which you want. But when
\add you choose not to obey his laws\add*, some day you will be living in the countries to which he will scatter you, and you
will remember \add what I told you\add*. 
\v 2 Then, if you return to Yahweh our God, and faithfully [IDI] obey all that I have today commanded you to do,
\v 3 he will act mercifully toward you. He will bring you back from the nations to which he scattered you, and he will cause
you to be prosperous again. 
\v 4 Even if you have been scattered to the most distant places on the earth, Yahweh our God will gather you from there and
bring you back \add to your land\add*. 
\v 5 He will enable you to possess again the land where your ancestors lived. And he will cause you to be more prosperous and
more numerous than you are now. 
\v 6 Yahweh our God will change \f + \fk metaphor \f* your inner beings, with the result that you will love him with all that you desire and
with all that you feel. And then you will continue to live in that land.
\v 7 Yahweh our God will send all the disasters that I have told you about on your enemies and on those who
oppressed/persecuted you, 
\v 8 and as you did before, you will do what Yahweh wants you to do, and you will obey all the commands that I have given to
you today. 
\v 9 Yahweh our God will cause you to be very prosperous in all that you do. You will have many children [IDI], and a lot of
cattle, and you will produce abundant crops. He will again be happy to enable you to prosper, just like he was happy to enable
your ancestors to prosper. 
\v 10  \add But he will do those things only\add* if you do what he has told you to do, and if you obey all his rules and
regulations that I have written about \add in this book/scroll\add*, and if you turn to Yahweh with all that you desire and
with all that you feel. 
\s God's commands are very accessible 
\p
\v 11 The commands that I am giving to you today are not very difficult for you
\add to obey\add*, and they are not \add difficult to know because
of\add* being far from you. 
\v 12 They are not in heaven, with the result that you need to say, ‘◄Who will need to go up to heaven for us to bring them
\add down here to us\add* in order that we can hear them and obey them?/Someone will need to go up to heaven for us to bring
them \add down here to us\add* in order that we can hear them and obey them.►’ \f + \fk rhetorical question \f*
\v 13 And they are not on the other side of the sea, with the result that you need to say, ‘◄Who will need to cross the sea for
us and bring them back to us, in order that we can hear them and obey them?/Someone will need to cross the sea for us and bring
them back to us, in order that we can hear them and obey them.►’ \f + \fk rhetorical question \f*
\v 14  \add We do not need to do that because\add* his commands are here with you. You know them \f + \fk metonymy \f* and you have ◄memorized
them/put them in your minds►. So you can \add easily\add* obey them.
\p
\v 15 So listen! Today I am allowing you to choose between \add doing what
is\add* evil and \add doing what is\add* good, between what will enable you to live
\add for a long time\add* and \add what will cause you\add* to die
\add while you are still young\add*. 
\v 16  \add I say again\add*, if you obey the commands of Yahweh our God that I am giving to you today, and if you love him and
conduct your lives as he wants you to do, and if you obey all his rules and regulations, you will prosper and become very
numerous, and Yahweh our God will bless you in the land that you are about to enter and possess.
\p
\v 17 But if you turn away \add from Yahweh\add* and refuse to heed what he says, and if you allow yourselves to be led away to
worship other gods, 
\v 18 I am warning you today that you will \add soon\add* die. You will not live for a long time in the land that you are about
to cross the Jordan \add River\add* to enter and possess. 
\p
\v 19 I am requesting \add everyone in\add* heaven and on the earth to testify to you, that today I am allowing you to choose
whether you \add want to\add* live for a long time or to soon die, whether
\add you want Yahweh to\add* bless you or to curse you. So choose to live.
\v 20  \add Choose to\add* love Yahweh our God, and to obey him \f + \fk metonymy \f*, and to ◄be faithful to/have a close relationship with►
him. If you do that, you and your descendants will live for a long time in the land that Yahweh solemnly promised to your
ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, that he would give to them.”
