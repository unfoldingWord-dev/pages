\c 10  
\s A new copy of the Ten Commandments 
\p
\v 1 “Then Yahweh said to me, ‘Cut two stone tablets like the first ones. And make a wooden chest to put them in. Then
\add bring the tablets\add* up to me on this mountain. 
\v 2 I will write on those tablets the same words that I wrote on the first tablets, the ones that you broke. Then you can put
them in the chest.’ 
\p
\v 3 So I made a chest. I used wood from an acacia tree to make it. Then I cut two tablets of stone like the first ones, and I
went up the mountain carrying the tablets. 
\v 4 There Yahweh wrote on the tablets the \add same\add* ten commandments
\add that he had written on the first tablet\add*. They are the commandments that he told to your ancestors from the midst of
the fire on the mountain, when they were gathered \add at the bottom of the
mountain\add*. Then Yahweh gave the tablets to me, 
\v 5 and I turned and went down the mountain. Then, just as he had commanded, I put them in the chest that I had made. And they
are still there.” 
\p
\v 6 (Then, from the wells that belonged to the people of Jaakan, the Israeli people traveled to Moserah. There Aaron died and
was buried, and his son Eleazar took his place and became the supreme priest.
\v 7 From there, the Israelis traveled to Gudgodah, and from there to Jotbathah, which was a place that had many streams.
\v 8 At that time, Yahweh ◄set apart/appointed► the tribe of Levi to carry the chest that contained
\add the tablets on which were written\add* the Ten Commandments, and to stand in Yahweh's presence
\add in the sacred tent\add*, to offer sacrifices, and to pray for Yahweh to bless
\add the people. They are still doing those things\add* at the present time.
\v 9 That is the reason that the tribe of Levi did not receive any land like the other tribes did. What they received was the
work/privilege of being Yahweh's \add priests\add*, which is what he said that they should do.)
\p
\v 10 “I stayed on the mountain forty days and nights, just like I did the first time.
\add I prayed to\add* Yahweh, and he ◄answered my prayers/did what I requested► again and said that he would not destroy your
ancestors. 
\v 11 Then Yahweh said to me, ‘Continue your journey, going in front of the people, to occupy the land that I solemnly promised
your ancestors that I would give to you.’ ” 
\s What Yahweh required 
\p
\v 12 “Now, you Israeli people, \add I will tell you\add* \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* what Yahweh our God requires/demands that you do. He requires
you to have an awesome respect for him, to conduct your lives as he wants you to, to love him, and to serve him with all that
you desire and all that you feel, 
\v 13 and to obey all of his commandments \f + \fk doublet \f* which I am giving to you today for your benefit.
\p
\v 14 Do not forget that Yahweh our God owns even the sky and everything that is in it. He also owns the earth and everything
that is on it. 
\v 15 But \add in spite of owning all those things\add*, Yahweh loved your ancestors, and from all the people-groups
\add on the earth\add* he chose us, their descendants, and we are still his people.
\v 16 So you must change your inner beings \f + \fk metaphor \f* and stop being stubborn [IDI].
\v 17 Yahweh our God is greater than all gods, and he is greater than all rulers. He is very powerful \f + \fk doublet \f* and awesome. He ◄is
impartial/does not do things that favor one ◄group/person► more than others►, and he does not accept bribes.
\v 18 He makes sure that orphans and widows are treated fairly. He loves even ◄foreigners/people from other countries► who live
among us Israeli people, and he gives them food and clothes. 
\v 19 So you must love those foreigners too, because you were once foreigners when you were living in Egypt.
\v 20 Have an awesome respect for Yahweh our God and worship only him. ◄Be faithful to/Have a close relationship with► him, and
say that he should punish you if you do not do what you promise.
\v 21 He is the one whom you must praise. He is our God, and we have seen the great and awesome things that he has done for us.
\v 22 When our ancestors, \add Jacob and his family\add*, went down to Egypt, there were only seventy of them. But now Yahweh
our God has caused us to be as numerous as the stars in the sky.”
