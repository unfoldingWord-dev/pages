\c 29  
\s The agreement made in Moab 
\p
\v 1 These are the things that the Israelis were required to do to obey the agreement that Yahweh was making with them. Moses/I
commanded them to make this agreement \add when they/we were\add* in the Moab region
\add on the east side of the Jordan River\add*. This was in addition to the agreement that Yahweh had made with them/us at
Sinai \add Mountain\add*. 
\p
\v 2 Moses/I summoned all the Israeli people and said to them, “You saw \f + \fk synecdoche \f* for yourselves what Yahweh did to the king of
Egypt and to his officials and to his entire country. 
\v 3 You \f + \fk synecdoche \f* saw all the plagues \add that Yahweh sent on them\add*, and all the various miracles \f + \fk doublet \f*
\add that Yahweh performed\add*. 
\v 4 But to this day, Yahweh has not enabled you to understand \add the meaning
of\add* all that you have seen and heard. 
\v 5 For forty years Yahweh has led you while you traveled/walked through the desert. During that time, your clothes and your
sandals have not worn out. 
\v 6 You did not have bread to eat or wine or other fermented/strong drinks to drink, but Yahweh
\add took care of you\add*, in order that you would know that he is your God.
\p
\v 7 And when we came to this place, Sihon, the king who ruled in Heshbon
\add city\add*, and Og, the king who ruled the Bashan \add region\add*, came out
\add with their armies\add* to attack us, but we defeated them. 
\v 8 We took/conquered their land and divided it among the tribes of Reuben and Gad, and half of the tribe of Manasseh.
\p
\v 9 So, obey faithfully all of this agreement, in order that you will prosper in everything that you do.
\v 10 Today all of you are standing in the presence of Yahweh our God. The leaders of all your tribes, your elders, your
officials, all you Israeli men, 
\v 11 your wives, your children, and the foreigners who live among you and cut wood for you and carry water for you,
\v 12  \add you are all here\add* today to agree to accept this solemn agreement with Yahweh.
\v 13  \add He is making this agreement with you\add* in order to confirm that you are his people, and that he is your God,
which is what he promised you, and which is what he solemnly promised to your ancestors Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.
\v 14 This solemn agreement is not only with you. 
\v 15 He is making this agreement with us \add who are here today\add* and also with our descendants who are not yet born.
\p
\v 16 You remember \add the things that our ancestors suffered\add* in Egypt, and how they traveled through the land that
belonged to other nations \add after they came out of Egypt\add*.
\v 17 In those countries they saw those disgusting idols made of wood and stone and
\add decorated with\add* silver and gold. 
\v 18 So be sure that no man or woman or family or tribe that is here
\add today\add* turns away from Yahweh our God, to worship/serve the gods of those nations. Doing that would be like a root
\add of a plant that would grow\add* among you and bear poisonous and bitter fruit \f + \fk metaphor \f*.
\p
\v 19 Be sure that no one here today who hears this solemn agreement ◄reassures/says to► himself, that ‘Everything will go well
with me, even if I stubbornly do what I want to.’ If you do that, the result will be that Yahweh will eventually get rid of all
of you, both good people and evil people \f + \fk metaphor \f*. 
\v 20 Yahweh will not forgive anyone who is \add stubborn\add* like that. Instead, he will be extremely angry \f + \fk doublet \f* with that
person, and all the curses that I have told you about will happen to that person, until Yahweh gets rid of that person and his
family [IDI]. 
\v 21 From all the tribes of Israel, Yahweh will separate that individual to suffer all the disasters that I have listed in the
agreement that states the things that Yahweh will do to curse \add those who
disobey\add* the laws \add that I have written\add* in this scroll/book.
\p
\v 22 In future years, your descendants and people from other countries will see the disasters and the illnesses that Yahweh
has caused to happen to you. 
\v 23 They will see that all your land has been ruined by burning sulfur and salt. Nothing will have been planted. Not even
weeds will be there. Your land will resemble Sodom and Gomorrah \add cities\add*, and Admah and Zeboiim
\add cities\add*, which Yahweh destroyed when he was very angry \f + \fk doublet \f*
\add with the people who lived there\add*. 
\v 24 And the people from those other nations will ask, ‘Why did Yahweh do this to this land? Why was he very angry
\add with the people who lived here\add*?’ 
\p
\v 25 Then other people will reply, ‘It is because they refused to obey the agreement that they had made with Yahweh, the God
whom their ancestors \add worshiped\add*, when he brought them out of Egypt.
\v 26 Instead, they served/worshiped other gods that they had never worshiped before, gods that Yahweh had not told them to
worship. 
\v 27 So, Yahweh became very angry with the people of this land, and he caused to happen to them all the disasters that their
leader warned them about. 
\v 28 Yahweh became extremely angry \f + \fk doublet \f* with them and took/yanked them \f + \fk metaphor \f* out of their land, and threw them into another
land, and they are still there.’ 
\p
\v 29  \add There are some\add* things that Yahweh our God has ◄kept secret/not revealed►, but he has revealed his laws to us,
and \add he expects\add* us and our descendants to obey them forever.”
