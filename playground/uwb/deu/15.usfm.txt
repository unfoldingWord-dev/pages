\c 15  
\s The year for canceling debts 
\p
\v 1 “At the end of every seven years, you must ◄cancel all debts/tell people who owe you money that they do not need to pay it
back►. 
\v 2 Do it like this: each of you who has lent money to a fellow Israeli must cancel that debt. You must not insist that he pay
it back. You must do that because Yahweh has declared that the debts must be canceled
\add every seven years\add*. 
\v 3  \add During that year\add* you may require foreigners \add who live among
you\add* to pay what they owe you, but you must not try to require that any fellow Israeli pay you what he owes you.
\v 4-5 Yahweh our God will bless you in the land that he is giving to you. If you obey Yahweh our God and obey all the
commandments that I am giving to you today, there will not be any poor people among you.
\v 6 Yahweh our God will bless you like he has promised to do, and you will
\add be able to\add* lend money to people of other people-groups, but you will not
\add need to\add* borrow from any of them. You will control \add the
finances\add* of many people-groups, but they will not control your
\add finances\add*. 
\p
\v 7 In the towns that Yahweh our God is giving to you, if there are any Israelis who are poor, do not be selfish [IDI] and
refuse [IDI] to help them. 
\v 8 Instead, be generous [IDI] and lend to them the money that they need.
\v 9 Be sure that you do not say to yourself, ‘The year when debts will be canceled is near,
\add so I do not want to lend anyone any money now, because he will not need to pay it back when that year
comes\add*.’ It would be evil to even think that. If you act in an unfriendly way toward a needy fellow Israeli, and give him
nothing, he will cry out to Yahweh against you, and \add Yahweh will say
that\add* you have sinned \add by not helping that person\add*. 
\v 10 Give freely to poor people and give generously [IDI]. 
\v 11 If you do that, Yahweh will bless you in everything that you do. There will always be some poor people in your land, so I
command you to give generously to poor \f + \fk doublet \f* people.” 
\s Freeing slaves 
\p
\v 12 “If any of your fellow Israeli men or women sell themselves to one of you
\add to become your slave\add*, you must free them after they have worked for you for six years. When the seventh year comes,
you must free them. 
\v 13 When you free them, do not allow them to go ◄empty-handed/without giving them anything►.
\v 14 Give to them generously from the things with which Yahweh has blessed you—sheep, grain, and wine.
\v 15 Do not forget that your ancestors were once slaves in Egypt, and Yahweh our God freed them. That is the reason that I am
now commanding you to do this. 
\p
\v 16 But one of your slaves may say, ‘I do not want to leave you.’ He loves you and your family, because you have treated him
well. 
\v 17 If he says that, take him to the door of your house and, \add while he stands against the
doorway\add*, pierce one of his earlobes with ◄an awl/a sharp pointed tool►. That will indicate that he will be your slave for
the rest of his life. Do the same thing to any female slave \add who does not want to leave
you\add*. 
\p
\v 18 Do not complain when you are required to free your slaves.
\add Keep in mind that\add* they served you for six years, and you paid them only half as much as you pay the servants that you
hire. \add If you free them\add*, Yahweh our God will bless you in everything that you do.”
\s Rules about sacrificing firstborn animals 
\p
\v 19 “◄Set aside for/Dedicate to► Yahweh our God the firstborn male animals from your cattle and sheep. Do not force them to
do any work for you, and do not ◄shear/cut off► the wool \add of the firstborn animals to sell the
wool\add*. 
\v 20 You and your family may \add kill them and\add* eat their meat in the presence of Yahweh at the place that Yahweh chooses
\add for you to worship him\add*. 
\v 21 But if the animals have any defects, if they are lame or blind, or if they have any other serious defect, you must not
sacrifice them to Yahweh our God. 
\v 22 You may \add kill and\add* eat \add the meat of those animals\add* at your homes. Those who have done things that cause
them to become unacceptable to God and those who have not done such things are permitted to eat that meat, just like anyone is
permitted to eat the meat of a deer or an antelope. 
\v 23 But you must not eat any of the blood; you must drain all the blood on the ground
\add when you kill those animals\add*.”
