\c 27  
\s The stone tablets set up on Ebal Mountain 
\p
\v 1 Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f*, along with the other Israeli leaders, said this to the people: “Obey all the commandments that I am giving to you
today. 
\v 2-4  \add Soon\add* you will cross the Jordan \add River\add* and enter the land that Yahweh, the God whom our ancestors
\add worshiped\add*, promised to give to you. There, in that very fertile [IDI] land on the
\add west\add* side of the Jordan \add River\add*, set up some large stones on Ebal Mountain, and cover them with plaster. Then
write on those stones all these laws and teachings\f + \ft Or: instructions \f*.
\v 5 And build a stone altar there to offer sacrifices to Yahweh, but do not do any work on those stones with iron tools.
\v 6 The altar that you make to burn sacrifices to Yahweh our God must be made with uncut stones.
\v 7 And there you must sacrifice offerings to restore fellowship with Yahweh, and you must eat
\add your share of those offerings\add* and rejoice\f + \ft Or: celebrate \f* in the presence of Yahweh.
\v 8 And, when you write these laws on those stones, you must write them very clearly.”
\p
\v 9 Then Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f*, along with the priests, said to all the Israeli people, “You Israeli people, be quiet and listen to what I
\add am saying\add*. Today you have become the people who belong to Yahweh, our God.
\v 10 So, you must do what he tells you, and obey all the rules and regulations that I am giving to you today.”
\s The curses from disobeying God 
\p
\v 11 On that same day Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* said to the Israeli people, 
\v 12 “After you have crossed over the Jordan \add River\add*, the tribes of Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph, and
Benjamin must stand on Gerizim Mountain and \add request Yahweh to\add* bless the people.
\v 13 And the tribes of Reuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali must stand on Ebal Mountain and listen to the things
that Yahweh will do when he curses the people. 
\p
\v 14 The descendants of Levi must shout these words loudly:

\v 15 ‘Yahweh will curse anyone who makes an idol of stone, or of wood, or of metal, and secretly sets it up
\add and worships it\add*.
