\c 21  
\s When no one knows who murdered someone else 
\p
\v 1 “Suppose someone has been murdered in a field in the land that Yahweh our God is giving to you, and you do not know who
killed that person. 
\v 2  \add If that happens\add*, your elders and judges must go out to where that person's corpse was found and measure the
distance from there to each of the nearby towns. 
\v 3 Then the elders in the town that is closest to where the corpse was found must select a young cow that has never been used
for doing work. 
\v 4 They must take it to a place near a stream where the ground has never been plowed or planted. They must break its neck
there in that valley. 
\v 5 The priests must go there also, because Yahweh our God has chosen them from the tribe of Levi to serve him and to be his
representatives \f + \fr metonymy \f* when they bless people. And he has also chosen them to settle disputes in which someone has been injured.
\v 6 The elders from the closest town must wash their hands over the young cow whose neck was broken,
\v 7 and they must say, ‘We did not murder this person \f + \fr metonymy \f*, and we did not see who did it.
\v 8 Yahweh, forgive us, your Israeli people whom you rescued \add from
Egypt\add*. Do not consider ◄us to be guilty/that we should be punished because► of murdering someone who ◄is innocent/had not
done something that is wrong►. Instead, forgive us.’ 
\v 9 By doing that, you will be doing what Yahweh considers to be right, and you will not be considered to be guilty for
murdering that person. 
\s The rule about marrying woman who are captured 
\p
\v 10 When you \add soldiers\add* go to fight against your enemies, and Yahweh our God enables you to defeat them [IDI], and
◄they become your prisoners/you capture them►, 
\v 11 one of you may see among them a beautiful woman that he likes, and he may want to marry her.
\v 12 He should take her to his home, and there she must shave \add all the hair
off\add* her head and cut her fingernails \add to signify that now she does not belong to her people-group anymore, but instead
she is becoming an Israeli\add*. 
\v 13 She must take off the clothes that she was wearing when she was captured,
\add and put on Israeli clothes\add*. She must stay in that man's house and mourn for a month because of
\add leaving\add* her parents. After that, he will be allowed to marry her.
\v 14 Later, if he no longer is pleased with her, he will be permitted to allow her to leave him. But because she was forced to
have sex with him, he will not be allowed to treat her like a slave
\add and sell her to someone else\add*. 
\s The oldest son's inheritance 
\p
\v 15 Suppose that a man has two wives, but he likes one of them and dislikes the other one. And suppose that they both give
birth to sons, and the oldest son is the child of the woman that he does not like.
\v 16 On the day when that man decides how he will divide his possessions for his sons to possess
\add after he dies\add*, he must not favor the son of the wife that he loves by giving him
\add a bigger share\add*, the share that the older son should receive.
\v 17 He must give two-thirds of his possessions to the older son, the son of the wife whom he does not like. That son is his
firstborn son, and he must be given the share that he should receive because of his being that man's firstborn son.
\s A rebellious son 
\p
\v 18 Suppose there is a boy who is very stubborn and always ◄rebelling against/disobeying►
\add his parents\add*, and who will not heed what they say to him. And suppose that they punish him but he still does not pay
attention to what they tell him \f + \fr metonymy \f*. 
\v 19 If that happens, his parents must take him to the ◄gate of/central meeting place in► the city where he lives and have him
stand in front of the elders of the city. 
\v 20 Then the parents must say to the elders of that city, ‘This son of ours is stubborn and always rebelling against us. He
will not pay attention to what we tell him \f + \fr metonymy \f*. He wastes a lot of money (OR, eats too much food) and gets drunk.’
\v 21 Then all the elders of that city must execute him by throwing stones at him. By doing that, you will get rid of this evil
practice from among you. And everyone in Israel will hear \add about what
happened\add* and they will be afraid \add to do what he did\add*.
\s Burying criminals 
\p
\v 22 If someone is executed for having committed a crime for which he deserves to die, and you hang his corpse on a post,
\v 23 you must not allow his corpse to remain there all night. You must bury it on the day that he died, because if you keep
the corpse on a post, God will curse the land. \add You must bury the corpse that
day\add*, in order that you do not defile the land that Yahweh our God is giving to you.”
