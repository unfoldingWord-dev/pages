\c 34  
\s How Moses died 
\p
\v 1 Then Moses climbed up from the plains in the Moab \add region\add* to the top of Pisgah Peak on Nebo Mountain, across
\add the Jordan River\add* from Jericho. There Yahweh showed him all the land
\add that the Israelis would occupy\add*. He showed him the Gilead
\add region\add* as far north as Dan \add city\add*; 
\v 2 all \add the land that the tribe of\add* Naphtali would occupy; all the land
\add that the tribes of\add* Ephraim and Manasseh \add had occupied\add*; all the land
\add that the tribe of\add* Judah would occupy as far west as the Mediterranean sea;
\v 3 the desert \add area in the south part of Judah\add*; and the Jordan Valley that extends from Jericho
\add in the north\add* to Zoar \add city in the south\add*. 
\v 4 Then Yahweh said to him, "You have now seen this land that I solemnly promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying 'I
will give it to your descendants.' I have allowed you to see it \add from a
distance\add*, but you will not go there." 
\p
\v 5 So Moses, who \add always\add* served Yahweh \add faithfully\add*, died there
\add on that mountain\add* in the Moab \add region\add*, which is what Yahweh said would happen.
\v 6 Yahweh buried Moses' body in a valley in the Moab \add region\add*, opposite\f + \ft Or: near \f* Beth-Peor
\add town\add*, but no one to this day knows where Yahweh buried him.
\v 7 Moses was 120 years old when he died, but he was still very strong, and he could still see \f + \ft metonymy \f* very well.
\v 8 The Israeli people mourned for him in the plains of the Moab
\add region\add* for thirty days. 
\p
\v 9 God caused Joshua to be very wise, because Moses had put his hands on Joshua
\add to appoint him to be their new leader\add*. The Israeli people obeyed Joshua, and they obeyed all the commands that Yahweh
had given to Moses to tell to the Israeli people. 
\p
\v 10 Since the time that Moses \add lived\add*, there has never been a prophet in Israel like him. Yahweh spoke to him
face-to-face\f + \ft Or: directly \f*. 
\v 11 No other prophet has performed all the kinds of \f + \ft doublet \f* miracles that Yahweh sent Moses to perform in front of the king of
Egypt, his officials, and all \f + \ft hyperbole \f* the people of Egypt. 
\v 12 No other prophet has been able to perform all the great and terrifying deeds that Moses performed while all the Israelis
watched.
