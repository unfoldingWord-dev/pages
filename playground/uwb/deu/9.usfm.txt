\c 9  
\s The reason that God will enable them to be victorious 
\p
\v 1 “You people of Israel, listen to me! You will soon \\f + \\ft hyperbole \\f* cross the Jordan
\add River\add*. In the land that you will enter, there are large cities that have very high walls
\add around them that seem to\add* \\f + \\ft hyperbole \\f* extend up to the sky. There are people-groups in that land that are more numerous and
more powerful than you are. 
\v 2 Those people are very tall and strong. \add Some of them\add* are giants who are descendants of Anak. You know about them,
and you have heard people say that no one \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* can defeat the descendants of Anak. But you will expel all of those
people-groups! 
\v 3 I want you to know that Yahweh our God will go ahead of you. He will be like a raging\f + \ft Or: roaring \f* fire. While you advance, he
will defeat and destroy them. As a result, you will quickly be able to expel some of them and kill the others, which is what
Yahweh promised that you would do. 
\p
\v 4 After Yahweh our God has expelled them for you, do not say to yourselves, ‘It is because we are righteous that Yahweh has
enabled us to capture this land.’ The truth is that it is because the people in that land are wicked that Yahweh will expel
them as you advance. 
\v 5  \add I say again that\add* it is not because you are righteous within yourselves or because you do things that are
righteous that you will enter and capture that land. It is because those people-groups are very wicked that Yahweh our God will
expel them as you advance, and because he intends to do what he solemnly promised to your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob
that he would do. 
\v 6 I want you to know that it is not because you are righteous that Yahweh our God is giving you this good\f + \ft Or: fertile \f* land. I
say that because you are \add not righteous\add*; you are a very stubborn [IDI] people.”
\s Moses reminded them of the golden calf 
\p
\v 7 “Never forget what your ancestors did in the desert that caused Yahweh our God to become angry. From the day that we left
Egypt until the day that we arrived here, you also have continually rebelled against him.
\v 8 Even at Sinai Mountain your ancestors caused Yahweh to become angry. Because he was very angry, he was ready to get rid of
\add all of\add* them. 
\v 9 When I climbed the mountain to receive from him the stone tablets on which he had written the Ten Commandments that he was
giving to them, I stayed there forty days and nights, and \add during that
time\add* I did not eat or drink anything. 
\v 10 Yahweh gave me the two stone tablets on which he had written
\add the commandments\add* with his own fingers. They were the words\f + \ft Or: commandments \f* that he had spoken to your ancestors from the
fire on that mountain, when they were gathered together \add at the bottom of the
mountain\add*. 
\p
\v 11 At the end of those forty days and nights, Yahweh gave me those two stone tablets on which he had written those
commandments. 
\v 12 But then he said to me, ‘Go down the mountain immediately, because the people whom you
\add are leading\add*, the people whom you led out of Egypt, have committed a terrible sin! They have very quickly done what I
commanded them not to do. They have made for themselves a metal statue
\add of a calf to worship\add*.’ 
\p
\v 13 Then Yahweh said to me, ‘I have been watching these people, and I see that they are very stubborn.
\v 14 So do not try to stop me. I am going to destroy all of them, with the result that no one anywhere will remember ◄their
names \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f*\f + \ft Or: that \f* they ever existed►. Then I will enable you to become
\add the ancestor of\add* a nation that will be more numerous and more powerful than they are.’
\p
\v 15 So I turned and went down the mountain, carrying in my hands the two stone tablets on which the Ten Commandments were
\add written\add*. Fire was burning all over the mountain. 
\v 16 I looked, and I was shocked to see that your ancestors had committed a
\add great\add* sin against Yahweh. They very quickly had begun to do what Yahweh our God had commanded them not to do. They
had \add requested Aaron to\add* make for them a \add metal image
of\add* a calf \add to worship\add*. 
\v 17 So while they were watching, I lifted up those two stone tablets and threw them
\add on the ground\add*, and they broke into pieces. 
\p
\v 18 Then I ◄prostrated myself\f + \ft Or: lay \f*► on the ground in Yahweh's presence as I had done before, and I did not eat or drink
anything for forty days and nights. I did that because your ancestors had sinned against Yahweh and caused him to become very
angry. 
\v 19 I was afraid\f + \ft Or: worried \f* that because Yahweh was very angry with them, he would get rid of all of them.
\add But again I prayed that he would not do that\add*, and again he listened to me
\add and answered my prayer\add*. 
\v 20 Yahweh was also very angry with Aaron \add for making that golden
calf\add* and was ready to kill Aaron. But at the same time I prayed for Aaron also,
\add and Yahweh answered my prayer\add*. 
\v 21 Your ancestors had sinned \add by requesting Aaron to make a metal statue of
a\add* calf. So I took that statue and \add I melted it\add* in a fire and crushed it and ground it into very tiny pieces
\\f + \\ft hyperbole \\f*. Then I threw those tiny pieces into the stream that flowed down the mountain.
\p
\v 22 Your ancestors also caused Yahweh to become very angry \add by what they
did\add* at \add places which they named\add* Taberah, Massah, and Kibroth-Hattaavah.
\p
\v 23 And when we were at Kadesh-Barnea, Yahweh said to your ancestors, ‘Go up and capture the land that I am about to give to
you!’ But they rebelled against him. They did not trust him, and they did not obey what he told \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* them to do.
\v 24 Your ancestors rebelled against Yahweh from the first day that I knew them,
\add in Egypt\add*. 
\p
\v 25 So, \add as I said\add*, I lay on the ground in Yahweh's presence for forty days and nights, because Yahweh had said that
he would get rid of your ancestors. 
\v 26 And I prayed to Yahweh, saying, ‘Lord God, these people belong to you; do not destroy them. They are people whom you
rescued and brought out of Egypt by your very great power. [DOU, MTY]
\v 27 Do not forget \add what you promised to\add* Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Ignore these stubborn and wicked people and the
sin that they have committed. 
\v 28 If you do not do that, \add and if you get rid of them\add*, the people of Egypt will
\add hear about it and\add* say that you were not able to bring them into the land that you promised to give to them. They will
say that you took them into the desert only to kill them there because you hated them.
\v 29 Do not forget that they are your people. \add You chose them\add* to belong to you. You brought them out
\add from Egypt\add* by your very great power [DOU, MTY].’ ”
