\c 11  
\s Moses reminded them of the great things that God did 
\p
\v 1 “\add Because of all that\add* Yahweh your God \add has done for
you\add*, you must love and continually obey all his rules and regulations and commandments.
\v 2 It was you and your ancestors, not your children, whom he disciplined
\add by causing all of you to have\f + \ft Or: experience \f* difficulties\add*. So, starting today, continue to think about his being very
great and very powerful. \f + \ft doublet, metonymy \f* 
\v 3 Think about the various miracles \f + \ft doublet \f* that he performed in Egypt. Think about what he did to the king of Egypt and to all
the land that he \add ruled\add*. 
\v 4 Think about what he did to the army of Egypt, to their horses and their chariots. Think about how he caused the Red Sea to
flood\f + \ft Or: cover \f* over them while they were pursuing your ancestors, and how the army of Egypt was completely wiped out\f + \ft Or: destroyed \f*.
\v 5 Think about what Yahweh did for your ancestors in the desert before you arrived at this place.
\v 6 Think about what he did to Dathan and Abiram, the two sons of Eliab from the tribe of Reuben. While all of your ancestors
were watching, the earth split open, and they fell into the opening
\add and disappeared\add*, along with their families and their tents, their servants, and their animals.
\v 7 You \f + \ft synecdoche \f* and your ancestors have seen all these miracles that Yahweh performed.
\p
\v 8 So, obey all the commandments that I am giving you today, in order that you will be strong and able to cross the river and
occupy the land that you are about to enter, 
\v 9 and in order that you will live for a long time in that land, a land that Yahweh solemnly promised your ancestors that he
would give to them and to their descendants, a land that is very fertile [IDI].
\v 10 The land that you are about to enter and occupy is not like the land of Egypt, where your ancestors lived. In Egypt,
after they planted seeds, it was necessary for them to work hard \f + \ft metonymy \f* to water
\add the plants that grew\add*. 
\v 11 But the land that you are about to enter is a land where there are many hills and valleys, where there is plenty of rain.
\v 12 Yahweh takes care of that land. He \f + \ft synecdoche \f* watches over it every day, from the beginning of each year to the end of each
year. 
\p
\v 13 Today I am commanding you to love Yahweh our God and to serve him with your entire inner beings. If you do that,
\v 14 each year he will send rain on your land at the right times\f + \ft Or: times when it is needed \f*, ◄in the autumn, Or: at the end of the
dry season► and in the spring\f + \ft Or: before the next dry season starts \f*. As a result, you will have grain and
\add grapes to make\add* wine and \add olives to make olive\add* oil.
\v 15 And he will cause grass to grow in your fields for your livestock
\add to eat\add*. You will have all the food that you want. 
\p
\v 16 But I warn you, do not turn away from Yahweh our God and start to worship other gods,
\v 17 because if you do that, Yahweh will become very angry with you. He will prevent any rain from falling. As a result, the
crops will not grow, and you will soon die \add from hunger\add* in the good land that Yahweh is about to give to you.
\v 18 So, keep thinking [IDI] about these commands. Write them \add on tiny
scrolls\add* and fasten them to your arms\f + \ft Or: wrists \f*, and write them on bands that you fasten to your foreheads
\add to help you to remember them\add*. 
\v 19 Teach them to your children again and again. Talk about them
\add all the time:\add* when you are in your houses and when you are walking outside; talk about them when you are lying down
and when you are doing things. 
\v 20 Write them on the doorposts and on the gates of your houses.
\v 21 Do that in order that you and your children will live for a long time in the land that Yahweh promised to our ancestors
that he would give to them. That land will belong to you \add and your
descendants\add* as long as there is a sky above the earth. 
\p
\v 22 Faithfully continue to obey what I am commanding you to do—to love Yahweh our God, and to conduct your lives as he wants
you to do, and to be faithful to\f + \ft Or: have a close relationship with \f* him.
\v 23 If you do that, Yahweh will expel all the people-groups in that land as you advance, people-groups that are more numerous
and more powerful than you are. 
\v 24 All the ground \add in that land\add* on which you walk will be yours. Your territory will extend from the desert
\add in the south\add* to the Lebanon \add Mountains in the north\add*, and from the Euphrates River
\add in the east\add* to the \add Mediterranean\add* Sea in the west.
\v 25 Yahweh our God will cause all the people in that land to be afraid of you, which is what he promised, with the result
that no people-group will be able to stop you. 
\p
\v 26 Listen carefully: today I am telling you \add that Yahweh will
either\add* bless \add you or he will\add* curse you. 
\v 27 If you obey the commandments of Yahweh our God that I am giving to you today, he will bless you.
\v 28 If you do not obey them, and if you turn away from him to worship other gods that you have never known about before, he
will curse you. 
\v 29 And when Yahweh brings you into the land that you are about to enter and occupy,
\add some of you must stand on top of\add* Gerizim Mountain and proclaim what will cause Yahweh to bless you, and
\add the others must stand on top of\add* Ebal Mountain and proclaim
\add what will cause Yahweh to\add* curse you.” 
\v 30 (Those two mountains are \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* west of the Jordan \add River\add*, west of the Jordan Valley in the land where the Canaan
people-group lives. They live close to the sacred trees near Gilgal.)
\v 31 “You will soon cross the Jordan \add River\add* to occupy the land that Yahweh our God is giving to you. When you enter
that land and start to live there, 
\v 32 be sure to obey all the rules and regulations that I am giving to you today.”
