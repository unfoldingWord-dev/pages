\c 19  
\s The cities of refuge 
\p
\v 1 “After Yahweh our God has gotten rid of the people-groups from the land that he is giving to you, and after you have
expelled them from their cities and you start to live in their houses,
\v 2-3 you must divide into three parts the land that he is giving to you. Then choose a city in each part. You must make good
roads \add in order that people can get to those cities easily\add*. Someone who kills another person can escape to one of
those cities \add to be safe/protected\add*. 
\p
\v 4 This is the rule about someone who has killed another person. If someone ◄accidentally/without planning to► kills another
person who was not his enemy, he may escape to \add one of those
cities\add* and be safe/protected there. 
\v 5 For example, if two men go into the forest to cut some wood, if the axe head comes off the handle while one of them is
chopping down a tree and the axe head strikes and kills the other man, the man
\add who was using the axe\add* will be allowed to run to one of those cities and be safe there,
\add because the people of that city will protect him\add*. 
\v 6 Because he accidentally killed someone, and because the man was not his enemy, he can try to run to one of those cities.
If there were only one city, it may be a long distance to that city. Then if the relative of the man who was killed \f + \fk metonymy \f*, the
man who is supposed/expected to get revenge, is very angry, he may be able to catch the other person before he arrives at that
city. 
\v 7  \add To prevent that from happening\add*, you must choose three cities, not only one,
\add in order that someone can get to one of those cities quickly\add*.
\p
\v 8-9 If you do everything that I am today commanding you to do, and if you love Yahweh our God, and if you conduct your lives
as he wants you to do, Yahweh our God will give you much more land than you will have when you first occupy it, which is what
he promised to do. He will give you all the land which he promised your ancestors that he would give to you. When he gives you
that land, you must select three more cities \add to which people may
escape\add*. 
\v 10 Do this in order that people who ◄are innocent/have killed someone else without planning to► will not die, and you will
not be guilty for \add allowing\add* them to be executed, in the land that Yahweh is giving to you.
\p
\v 11 But suppose someone hates his enemy and hides and waits for that person
\add to come along the road\add*. Then \add when he passes by, suddenly\add* he attacks him and murders him. If the attacker
flees to one of those cities \add to be protected there\add*, 
\v 12 the elders of the city \add where the murdered man lived must not protect the
attacker\add*. They must send someone to the city to which the other man escaped, and bring him to \f + \fk metonymy \f* the relative who is
supposed/expected to get revenge, so that he may execute that man.
\v 13 You must not pity those who murder other people! Instead, you must
\add execute them\add*, in order that the people in the land of Israel will not be punished \f + \fk metonymy \f* for murdering innocent
people, and in order that things will go well for you. 
\s Warning against moving boundaries 
\p
\v 14  \add When you are living\add* in the land that Yahweh our God is giving to you, do not move the markers of your
neighbors' property boundaries which were placed there long ago.
\s Warnings about witnesses 
\p
\v 15 If someone is accused of committing a crime, one ◄witness/person who says, ‘I saw him do it’► is not enough. There must
be at least two ◄witnesses/people who say, ‘We saw him do it’►. \add If there is only one
witness\add*, the judge must not believe that what he says is true.
\p
\v 16 If someone tries to do wrong to another person by falsely accusing him,
\v 17 both of them must go to the place where the people worship, to
\add talk to\add* the priests and judges who are serving at that time.
\v 18 The judges must ◄investigate the case carefully/try to find out which one is telling the truth►. If
\add the judges determine that\add* one of them has accused the other falsely,
\v 19 that person must be punished in the same way that the other one would have been punished
\add if the judge decided that he ◄was guilty/had done what is wrong►\add*. By punishing such people, you will get rid of this
evil practice from among you. 
\v 20 And/Because when that person is punished, everyone will hear what has happened, and they will be afraid, and no one will
dare to act that way anymore. 
\v 21 You must not pity people who are punished like that. The rule should be that a person who has murdered someone else must
be executed; one of a person's eyes must be gouged out if he has gouged out someone else's eye, one tooth of a person who has
knocked out the tooth of another person must be knocked out; one hand of a person who has cut off the hand of another person
must likewise be cut off; one foot of a person who has cut off the foot of another person must also be cut off.”
