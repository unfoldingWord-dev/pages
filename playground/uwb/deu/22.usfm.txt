\c 22  
\s Various other laws 
\p
\v 1 “If you see some Israeli's ox or sheep that has strayed away, do not act as though you did not see it. Take it back
\add to its owner\add*. 
\v 2 But if the owner does not live near you, or if you do not know who the owner is, take the animal to your house.
\add It can stay with you\add* until the owner comes, searching for it. Then you must give the animal to him.
\v 3 You must do that same thing if you see a donkey, or a piece of clothing, or anything else that someone has lost. Do not
refuse to do what you should do. 
\p
\v 4 And if you see a fellow Israeli's donkey or cow that has fallen down on the road, do not act as though you did not see it.
Help the owner to lift the animal up \add so that it can stand on its feet
again\add*. 
\p
\v 5 Women must not wear men's clothes, and men must not wear women's clothes. Yahweh our God hates people who do things like
that. 
\p
\v 6 If you happen to find a bird's nest in a tree or on the ground, and the mother bird is sitting in the nest on its eggs or
with the baby birds, do not take the mother bird \add and kill it\add*.
\v 7 You are permitted to take the baby birds, but you must allow the mother bird to fly away. Do this in order that things
will go well for you and that you will live for a long time. 
\p
\v 8 If you build a new house, you must put a railing\f + \ft Or: low wall \f* around the edge of the roof. If you do that, and if someone
falls off the roof \add and dies\add*, ◄you will not be guilty of causing that person to die\f + \ft Or: his \f* death \f + \ft metonymy \f* will not be your
fault►. 
\p
\v 9 Do not plant any crop in the area where your grapevines are growing. If you do, you are not allowed to harvest the crops
that you have planted or to harvest the grapes \add to make wine from
them\add*. 
\p
\v 10 Do not hitch together an ox and a donkey \add for plowing your
fields\add*. 
\p
\v 11 Do not wear clothing that is made by weaving together wool and linen\f + \ft Or: two different kinds of thread \f*.
\p
\v 12  \add Twist threads together to\add* make tassels and sew\f + \ft Or: fasten \f* them on the four bottom corners of your cloak.
\s Rules concerning sex 
\p
\v 13 Suppose a man marries a young woman and has sex with her and later decides that he does not want her anymore,
\v 14 and he says false things about her, and claims that she was not a virgin when he married her.
\v 15 If that happens, the young woman's parents must take the sheet that was on the bed when that man and their daughter were
married, which still has bloodstains on it, and show it to the elders of the city at the gate of\f + \ft Or: central meeting place in \f* the
city. 
\v 16 Then the father of the young woman must say to the elders, ‘I gave my daughter to this man to be his wife. But now he
says that he doesn't want her anymore. 
\v 17 And he has falsely said that she was not a virgin when he married her. But look! Here is what proves that my daughter was
a virgin! Look at the bloodstains on the sheet where they slept the night that they were married!’ And he will show the sheet
to the elders. 
\v 18 Then the elders of that city must take that man and whip him.
\v 19 They shall require that he pay a fine of 100 pieces of silver and give the money to the father of the young woman,
because the man caused an Israeli young woman to be disgraced. Also, that woman must continue to live with him; she is his
wife. He is not allowed to divorce her during the rest of his life.
\p
\v 20 But if what the man said is true, and there is nothing to prove that she was a virgin when he married her,
\v 21 they must take that young woman to the door of her father's house. Then the men of that city must execute her by throwing
stones at her. They must do that because she has done something in Israel that is very disgraceful, by having sex with some man
\add while she was still living\add* in her father's house. By executing her like that, you will get rid of this evil practice
from among you. 
\p
\v 22 If a man is caught while he is having sex with another man's wife, both of them must be executed. By doing that, you will
get rid of this evil practice from Israel. 
\p
\v 23 Suppose in some town a man sees a young woman who is engaged\f + \ft Or: promised \f* to be married to another man, and he is caught
having sex with \f + \ft euphemism \f* her. 
\v 24 You must take both of them to the gate of\f + \ft Or: central meeting place in \f* that town. There you must execute them both by
throwing stones at them. You must execute the young women because she did not shout for help even though she was in the town.
And the man must be executed because he had sex \f + \ft euphemism \f* with someone who was already engaged\f + \ft Or: promised \f* to be married. By doing
that, you will get rid of this evil practice from among you. 
\p
\v 25 But suppose out in the open countryside a man meets a young woman who is engaged\f + \ft Or: promised \f* to be married, and he rapes
her. If that happens, only that man must be executed. 
\v 26 But you must not punish the young woman, because she did not do anything for which she deserves to be executed. This case
is like when one man attacks another man \add in the countryside\add* and murders him,
\v 27 because the man who raped her saw her when she was in the open countryside, and even though she called out for help,
there was no one there who could rescue her. 
\p
\v 28 If a man rapes a young woman who is not engaged\f + \ft Or: promised \f* to be married, if someone sees him while he is doing that,
\v 29 that man must pay 50 pieces of silver to the young woman's father, and he must marry her, because he forced her to have
sex with him. He is not allowed to divorce her during the rest of his life.
\p
\v 30 A man must not disgrace his father by having sex with any of his father's wives.”
