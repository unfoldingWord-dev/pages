\c 12  
\s The one place for worship 
\p
\v 1 “◄I will now tell you/These are► the rules and regulations that you must faithfully obey in the land that Yahweh, the God
whom our ancestors \add worshiped\add* is giving to you to occupy. You must obey these laws all the time that you are alive.
\v 2 You must destroy all the places where the people-groups that you will expel worship their gods, on the tops of mountains
and hills and under big green trees. 
\v 3 You must tear down their altars and smash their sacred pillars. Burn the statues of their goddess Asherah and chop down
their wooden idols, in order that no one will ever worship them \f + \fk metonymy \f* in those places again.
\p
\v 4 Do not worship Yahweh \add like the people in Canaan worship their
gods\add*. 
\v 5 Instead, you must go to the place that Yahweh will choose. It will be in the area where one of your tribes will live. That
is where you must enter Yahweh's presence and worship him. 
\v 6 That is the place where you must bring your sacrifices that will be completely burned on the altar, and your other
sacrifices, ◄your tithes/ten percent of all of your crops►, other offerings that you decide to give, and the firstborn animals
from your cattle and sheep. 
\v 7 There, in the presence of Yahweh our God, who has \add greatly\add* blessed you, you and your families will eat the good
things that you have worked to produce, and you will be happy. 
\p
\v 8  \add When you are in that land\add*, you must not do some of the things that we have been doing. Until now, you have all
been worshiping \add Yahweh\add* the way you wanted to, 
\v 9 because you have not yet arrived in the land which Yahweh is giving to you, where you will be able to live peacefully.
\v 10 But when you cross the Jordan \add River\add*, you will start to live in the land that Yahweh our God is giving to you.
He will protect you from all your enemies that will surround you, and you will live peacefully/safely.
\p
\v 11 Yahweh will choose one place where he wants you to worship him. That is the place to which you must bring all the
offerings that I command you to bring: the sacrifices that must be completely burned
\add on the altar\add*, your other sacrifices, other offerings that you yourselves decide to give, ◄your tithes/ten percent of
all your crops►, and all the special offerings that you will solemnly promise to give to Yahweh.
\v 12 Rejoice there in the presence of Yahweh, along with your children, your male and female servants, and the descendants of
Levi who live in your towns. Do not forget that the descendants of Levi will not have their own land, like you do.
\v 13 Be sure that you do not offer sacrifices anywhere you want to.
\v 14 You must offer them only in the place that Yahweh will choose for you, in an area that belongs to one of your tribes.
That is the only place where he wants you to offer sacrifices that will be completely burned
\add on the altar\add*, and to do the other things that I am commanding you to do
\add when you worship him\add*. 
\p
\v 15 However, you will be permitted to kill and eat the meat of your animals in the places where you live. As often as you
want to, you may eat meat from the animals that Yahweh our God will bless you by giving them to you. Those who have done things
that cause them to become unacceptable to God and those who have not done things like that may all eat that meat, just like you
would eat the meat of a deer or an antelope. 
\v 16 But you must not eat the blood \add of any animals\add*; you must let the blood drain onto the ground
\add before you cook the meat\add*. 
\v 17 In the places where you live, you must not eat the things that you are offering
\add to Yahweh:\add* you must not eat the ◄tithes/ten percent► of your grain or of your wine, or of your
\add olive\add* oil, or the firstborn of your cattle and sheep, or the offerings that you yourselves decide to give to Yahweh,
or any other offerings. 
\v 18 Instead, you and your children and your male and female servants and the descendants of Levi who live in your towns must
eat those things in the presence of Yahweh in the place that he chooses. And you should be happy about everything that you have
done. 
\v 19 Be sure that you take care of the descendants of Levi all during the time that you live in your land.
\p
\v 20 When Yahweh our God gives you much more land \add than you will have when you first occupy
it\add*, which is what he has promised to do, and you say ‘I would like some meat to eat’ because you are craving/wanting some
meat, you are permitted to eat meat whenever you want to. 
\v 21 If the place that Yahweh our God chooses to be the place for you to worship him is far
\add from where you live\add*, you are permitted to kill some of your cattle or sheep that Yahweh has given to you, and you may
eat that meat at the places where you live, just like I have told you to do.
\v 22 Those who have done things that cause them to become unacceptable to God and those who have not done things like that are
permitted to all eat that meat, just like you would eat the meat of a deer or an antelope.
\v 23 But be sure that you do not eat the blood \add of any animal\add*, because it is the blood that sustains life in living
beings, and so you must not eat the life along with the meat. 
\v 24 Do not eat the blood; instead, let it drain onto the ground.
\v 25 If you obey this command and do what Yahweh says is right \add for you to
do\add*, things will go well for you and for your descendants. 
\p
\v 26 But the sacred offerings that Yahweh has told you to give and the other offerings that you yourselves decide to give, you
must take to the place that Yahweh will choose. 
\v 27 You must offer there the sacrifices that will be completely burned
\add on Yahweh's altar\add*. You must also offer there the sacrifices from which you may eat some of meat after you
\add kill the animals and\add* drain out the blood and throw some of it on the
\add sides of the\add* altar. 
\v 28 Faithfully obey all these things that I have commanded you. If you do that, things will go well forever for you and your
descendants, because you will be doing what Yahweh our God says is right
\add for you to do\add* and what pleases him. 
\p
\v 29 When you enter the land that you will occupy, as you advance, Yahweh our God will get rid of the people-groups that live
there. 
\v 30 After he does that, be sure that you do not \add worship the
gods\add* that they have been worshiping, because if you do that, it will be like a trap
\add that will catch you\add* \f + \fk metaphor \f*. Do not ask anyone about those gods, saying, ‘Tell me how they worshiped their gods, in
order that I can \add worship Yahweh\add* in the same way.’ 
\v 31 Do not try to worship Yahweh our God like they have worshiped their gods, because when they worship them, they do
disgusting things, things that Yahweh hates. \add The worst thing that they do
is\add* that they sacrifice their own children and burn them \add on their
altars\add*. 
\p
\v 32 Be sure to do everything that I have commanded you to do. Do not add anything to these commands, and do not take anything
away from them.”
