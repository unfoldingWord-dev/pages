\c 23  
\s Exclusion from Yahweh's people 
\p
\v 1 “Any man whose testicles are crushed or whose penis is cut off shall not be ◄included as one of/allowed to worship with►
Yahweh's people. 
\p
\v 2 No ◄illegitimate person/person whose mother and father were not married►, or descendant of that person, extending to the
tenth generation, shall be included as one of Yahweh's people. 
\p
\v 3 No one from the Ammon or Moab people-groups shall be ◄included as one of/allowed to worship with► Yahweh's people,
extending to the tenth generation. 
\v 4 One reason is that \add their leaders\add* refused to give your ancestors food and water when they were traveling from
Egypt \add to Canaan\add*. Another reason is that they paid Balaam, the son of Beor from Pethor
\add town\add* in Mesopotamia, to curse you Israelis. 
\v 5 But Yahweh our God did not pay attention to Balaam; instead, he caused Balaam to bless your ancestors, because Yahweh
loved them. 
\v 6 As long as Israel is a nation, you must not do anything to cause things to go well for those two people-groups to enable
them to prosper. 
\p
\v 7 But do not despise anyone from the Edom people-group, because they are
\add descendants of your ancestor Jacob\add*, just like you are. And do not despise people from Egypt, because
\add they treated your ancestors well when\add* they first lived in Egypt.
\v 8 The children and grandchildren of people from Edom and Egypt
\add who live among you\add* may be ◄included among/allowed to worship with► Yahweh's people.
\s Keeping the camp clean 
\p
\v 9 When your soldiers are living in tents at a time of fighting your enemies, they must avoid doing things that would make
them unacceptable to God. 
\v 10 If any soldier becomes unacceptable to God because semen comes out of his body during the night,
\add the next morning\add* he must go outside the camp and stay there during that day.
\v 11 But in the evening of that day, he must bathe himself, and at sunset he is allowed to come back into the camp.
\p
\v 12 Your soldiers must have a toilet area outside the camp where you can go
\add when you need to\add*. 
\v 13  \add When you go to fight against your enemies\add*, carry a stick along with your weapons, in order that when you need
to defecate \f + \fr euphemism \f*, you can dig a hole with the stick, and then cover up the hole
\add when you have finished defecating\add*. 
\v 14 You must keep the camp acceptable to Yahweh our God, because he is with you in your camp to protect you and to enable you
to defeat your enemies. Do not do anything disgraceful/indecent that would cause Yahweh to abandon you.
\s Various other laws 
\p
\v 15 If slaves who escape from their masters come to you \add and request you to protect
them\add*, do not send them back to their masters. 
\v 16 Allow them to stay/live among you, in whatever town they choose, and do not mistreat them.
\p
\v 17 Do not \add allow\add* any Israeli man or woman to become prostitutes at the temple.
\v 18 Also, do not allow any people who earned money from being a prostitute to bring any of that money into the temple of
Yahweh our God, even if they solemnly promised to pay that money to Yahweh. Yahweh hates those who are prostitutes.
\p
\v 19 When you lend money or food or anything else to a fellow Israeli, do not charge them interest.
\v 20 You are allowed to charge interest when you lend money to foreigners
\add who live in your land\add*, but not when you lend money to Israelis. Do this in order that Yahweh our God will bless you
in everything that you do in the land that you are about to enter and occupy.
\p
\v 21 When you solemnly promise to give something to Yahweh your God
\add or to do something for him\add*, do not delay in doing it. Yahweh expects you to do what you promised, and if you do not
do it, you will be committing a sin. 
\v 22 But if you \f + \fr synecdoche \f* do not solemnly promise \add to do something\add*, that is not sinful.
\v 23 But if you voluntarily promise to do something, you must do it.
\p
\v 24 When you walk through someone else's vineyard, you are allowed to
\add pick and\add* eat as many grapes as you want, but you must not
\add cut some and carry them away\add* in a container. 
\v 25 When you walk \add along a path\add* in someone else's field of grain, you are allowed to pluck/pick some of the grain
and eat it, but you must not cut any grain with a sickle \add and take it with
you\add*.”
