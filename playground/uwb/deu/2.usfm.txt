\c 2  
\s Moses reminded them of their wandering in the desert 
\p
\v 1 “Then we turned around and went through the desert toward the Red Sea\f + \ft Or: Gulf of Aqaba \f* as Yahweh told us to do, and we
wandered in the Edom area for many years. 
\p
\v 2 Then Yahweh said to me, 
\v 3 ‘You have been wandering around this hilly area for a long enough time. Now turn
\add and travel\add* toward the north. 
\v 4 And tell the people that they are about to travel near the land that belongs to the descendants of Esau, who are also
descendants of Isaac. They live in \add the hilly\add* Edom region. They will be afraid of you,
\v 5 but do not start to fight against them, because I am not going to give you even a tiny bit \f + \ft hyperbole \f* of their land. I have
given that land to the descendants of Esau. 
\v 6  \add When you travel near their land\add*, buy food and water from them.’
\p
\v 7 Do not forget that Yahweh our God has blessed you in everything that you \f + \ft synecdoche \f* have done. He knows
\add what has happened to you while\add* you have wandered in this huge desert. But he has been with you during those forty
years, and as a result you have had everything that you needed \f + \ft litotes \f*.
\p
\v 8 So we continued to travel. We avoided going through the hilly area where the descendants of Esau live. We stayed away from
the road through the Jordan \add River Valley\add* past Ezion-Geber and Elath
\add towns\add*, and we turned and traveled northeast toward the desert area where the Moab people-group lives.
\p
\v 9 Yahweh said to me, ‘Do not bother\f + \ft Or: harass \f* the people of Moab, and do not start to fight against them, because I am not
going to give you any of their land. \add Do not forget that\add* they are descendants of
\add Abraham's nephew\add* Lot, and I have given to them Ar \add city, their capital, and the other areas in that
country\add*.’ ” 
\p
\v 10 A large group of giants called Emim formerly lived there. They were as tall as the giants who were descendants of Anak.
\v 11 They and the descendants of Anak are also called the Repha giants, but the people of Moab call them Emim.
\v 12 The Hor people-group also formerly lived in the Edom area, but the descendants of Esau chased them out. They defeated and
killed them and settled in\f + \ft Or: occupied \f* their land, just as the Israeli people later expelled their enemies from the land that
Yahweh gave to them. 
\p
\v 13  \add Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* also said to the Israeli people\add*, “Then we crossed the Zered Gorge, as Yahweh told us to do.
\v 14 It had been thirty-eight years from the time we first left Kadesh-Barnea until we crossed the Zered Gorge. During those
years, all the Israeli fighting men\f + \ft Or: soldiers \f* of that generation had died, as Yahweh had solemnly said would happen.
\v 15 They died because Yahweh opposed them, until he had gotten rid of all of them.
\p
\v 16 After all the men who had been old enough to fight in wars had died \f + \ft doublet \f*,
\v 17 Yahweh said to me, 
\v 18 ‘Today you all must travel through the Moab region, near Ar,
\add their capital city\add*. 
\v 19 When you come near the border of the land where the Ammon people-group live, do not bother\f + \ft Or: harass \f* them or start to fight
against them. They are also descendants of Lot, so I am not going to give you any of the land that I have given to them.’ ”
\s Other groups that lived near Canaan 
\p
\v 20 That region is also called the land of the Repha giants, who formerly lived there. The Ammon people-group call them the
Zamzum group. 
\v 21 They were a large and powerful group, who were as tall as the descendants of Anak. But Yahweh got rid of them, and the
Ammon people-group expelled them and took their land away from them and started to live there.
\v 22 Yahweh had done the same thing for the descendants of Esau who live in the hilly area of Edom. He got rid of the Hor
people-group, with the result that the Edom people-group took their land from them and started to live there. They still live
there. 
\v 23 People who came from Crete \add Island\add* got rid of the Av group
\add who previously lived in the land close to the Mediterranean
Sea\add*, as far south as Gaza. They took their land from them and started to live there.
\s Moses reminded them of crossing the Arnon River 
\p
\v 24 “\add After we had gone through the Moab region\add*, Yahweh said to us, ‘Now cross the Arnon
\add River\add*. I will help you to defeat [IDI] \add the army of\add* Sihon, the king of the Amor people-group, who lives in
Heshbon \add city\add*. So attack their army and start to take their land from them.
\v 25 Today I will begin to cause everyone, everywhere, to be afraid of you. Everyone who hears about you will tremble and be
terrified.’ 
\p
\v 26 Then I sent messengers to go from the desert to King Sihon at Heshbon. I told them to give this peaceful message to the
king: 
\v 27 ‘Please allow us to travel through your land. We \add promise
that\add* we will stay on the road; we will not turn off to the right or to the left.
\v 28 We will pay for any food or water that you allow us to buy. We want only to walk through your country,
\v 29 until we cross the Jordan \add River\add* into the land that Yahweh our God is giving to us. Do for us just as the
descendants of Esau who live in the Edom area and the Moab people-group did for us when they allowed us to go through their
areas.’ 
\v 30 But King Sihon would not allow us to go through his country. That was because Yahweh our God caused him to be stubborn
[IDI]. The result was that Yahweh enabled us to defeat his army and take his land [IDI], which we still live in.
\p
\v 31 Yahweh said to me, ‘Listen! I am about to allow you to defeat Sihon's
\add army\add* and to take the people's land from them. So start to occupy it!’
\p
\v 32 Then Sihon came out \add of the city\add* with all his army to fight against us at Jahaz
\add town\add*. 
\v 33 But God enabled us to defeat \f + \ft doublet \f* them, and we killed Sihon and his sons and all his soldiers.
\v 34 We captured all their cities and destroyed them all. We killed all the men and women and children; we did not allow any
of them to remain alive. 
\v 35 We took the valuable things that were in the cities that we captured and also their cattle.
\v 36 Yahweh our God enabled us to capture [IDI] all their towns from Aroer
\add in the south\add*, which is at the edge of the Arnon \add River
Valley\add*, to the Gilead \add region in the north\add*. Some of their cities had
\add walls around them\add*, but we were able to \add climb over
them\add*. 
\v 37 But we did not go near the area where the Ammon people-group live, or the banks of the Jabbok riverbed, or the towns of
the hilly area, or any other place where Yahweh our God told us not to go.”
