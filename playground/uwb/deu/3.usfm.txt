\s Moses reminded them of the defeat of King Og 
\p
\v 1 “Then we turned \add north\add* and went toward the Bashan region. Og, the king
\add of that area\add*, and all his soldiers marched \add south\add* to fight against us at Edrei
\add town\add*. 
\v 2 Yahweh said to me, ‘Do not be afraid of him, because I will enable your
\add army\add* to defeat \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* him and all his army and to capture all their land. Do to him what you did to Sihon, the king of
the Amor people-group, who ruled in Heshbon \add city\add*.’ 
\p
\v 3 So Yahweh enabled us to defeat [IDI] King Og and all his army. We killed them all; we did not allow any of them to remain
alive. 
\v 4 There were 60 cities in that region near Argob, in King Og's kingdom of Bashan. But we captured all of them
\v 5 All those cities had high walls \add around them\add* with gates and bars. We also captured many villages that did not
have walls \add around them\add*. 
\v 6 We completely destroyed everything, just as we had done \add in the area
that\add* King Sihon ruled. We killed all the men, women, and children.
\v 7 But from those cities we took for ourselves all the livestock and other valuable things.
\p
\v 8 So at that time we took from those two kings of the Amor people-group all the land east of the Jordan
\add River\add*, from the Arnon \add River\add* gorge \add in the
south\add* to Hermon Mountain \add in the north\add*.” 
\v 9 (That mountain is called Sirion by the people of Sidon \add city\add* and is called Senir by the Amor people-group.)
\v 10 “We captured all the towns on the ◄plateau\f + \ft Or: high \f* level land►, and all the Gilead
\add region\add*, and all the Bashan \add region\add* as far east as Edrei and Salecah towns, which also belonged to Og's
kingdom.” 
\v 11 (Og was the last king who was a descendant of the Repha giants. His bed was made of iron. It was almost ◄14 ft.\f + \ft Or: 4 \f* meters►
long and ◄6 ft.\f + \ft Or: 2 \f* meters► wide. It is still \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* in Rabbah \add city\add* in the Ammon area.)
\s Moses reminded them of dividing the land east of the Jordan 
\p
\v 12 “From the land that we captured at that time, I allotted to the tribes of Reuben and Gad the land
\add north\add* of Aroer \add town\add* near the Arnon \add River\add*, and some of the hilly area of the Gilead
\add region\add*, along with the nearby towns. 
\v 13 The other part of the Gilead \add region\add* and all of the Bashan
\add region\add*, which was the Argob \add region\add* that King Og had ruled, I allotted to half of the tribe of Manasseh.”
(The entire Bashan \add region\add* is called the land of the Repha giants.)
\v 14 “Jair, from the tribe of Manasseh, conquered all the Bashan area as far
\add north\add* as the border of the Geshur and Maacath territories. He gave his own name to the villages there, and they are
still called the villages of Jair. 
\p
\v 15 The \add northern part of\add* the Gilead \add region\add* I allotted to the Machir
\add clan, who are descendants of the tribe of Manasseh\add*. 
\v 16 I allotted to the tribes of Reuben and Gad the southern part of the Gilead
\add region, extending south\add* to the Arnon \add River\add*. The middle of the river is the
\add southern\add* boundary. The \add northern\add* boundary is the Jabbok River, which is part of the border of the Ammon
area. 
\v 17  \add To the west their territory extended\add* to the Jordan River Valley, from Galilee Lake
\add in the north\add* to the Dead Sea \add in the south\add* and to the to slopes of Pisgah
\add Mountain\add* to the east. 
\p
\v 18 At that time, I told you three tribes, ‘Yahweh our God is giving you this land
\add east of the Jordan River\add*, for you to occupy\f + \ft Or: capture \f*. So now, give your soldiers weapons, and send them
\add across the Jordan River\add* ahead of the men from the other Israeli tribes
\add to help them to conquer\f + \ft Or: capture \f* the land that has been allotted
to\add* them. 
\v 19 But your wives and children and your very numerous cattle must stay in the towns that I have allotted to you.
\v 20  \add Your men must help\add* your fellow Israelis until Yahweh enables them to live there peacefully after they capture
all the land that Yahweh our God is giving to them on the west side of the Jordan
\add River\add*, just like he did for you \add here on the east side of the
river\add*. After that, you all may return to this land that I have allotted to you.’
\p
\v 21 And I told Joshua, ‘You \\f + \\ft synecdoche \\f* have seen everything that Yahweh our God did to those two kings,
\add Sihon and Og\add*. He will do the same thing to the people \add who are
now\add* in the land that you will be entering. 
\v 22 Do not be afraid of those people, because Yahweh our God is the one who will fight for you all.’ ”
\s Moses reminded them that he was not allowed to enter Canaan 
\p
\v 23 “At that time, I earnestly prayed, saying 
\v 24 ‘Yahweh our Lord, you have merely begun to show me that you are very great and to show me the powerful things that you
can do \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f*. There is certainly no \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* god in heaven or on earth who can do the powerful things\f + \ft Or: deeds \f* that you
\add have done\add*. 
\v 25 So please allow me to cross the Jordan \add River\add* and to see the good\f + \ft Or: fertile \f* land on the east side, the beautiful
hilly area and \add the mountains in\add* Lebanon.’ 
\p
\v 26 But Yahweh was angry with me because of what your ancestors
\add had done\add*, so he would not pay attention to me. Instead, he said, ‘That is enough
\add talk from\add* you! Do not talk to me about that again! 
\v 27 Climb up to the top of Pisgah \add Mountain\add* and look toward the west and to the east, toward the north and to the
south. Look at \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* it all carefully, because you will not cross the Jordan
\add River to see the land from there\add*. 
\v 28 But tell Joshua what he must do and encourage him to be strong, because he is the one who will lead the people
\add across the river in order that they can\add* occupy\f + \ft Or: capture \f* the land that you will see
\add from the top of the mountain\add*.’ 
\p
\v 29 So we remained in the \add Jordan River\add* Valley close to Beth-Peor
\add town\add*.”
