\s David found out about Saul's death 
\p
\v 1 After Saul died, David \add and the men who were with him\add* returned to Ziklag
\add town\add* after defeating the descendants of Amalek. They stayed in Ziklag for two days.
\v 2 On the third day, unexpectedly a man arrived there who had come from where Saul's army was camped. He had torn his clothes
and put dust on his head \add to show that he was grieving\add*. He came to David, and prostrated himself on the ground
\add in front of David to show respect for him\add*. 
\p
\v 3 David asked him, "Where have you come from?" The man replied, "I escaped from where the Israeli army is camped."
\p
\v 4 David asked him, "What happened? Tell me \add about the battle\add*!" The man replied, "The Israeli soldiers ran away from
the battle. Many of them were killed. And Saul and his son Jonathan are dead\f + \ft Or: were also killed \f*."
\p
\v 5 David said to the young man, "How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?"
\p
\v 6 The young man replied, "It happened that I was on Gilboa Mountain
\add where the battle occurred\add*, and I saw Saul, leaning on his spear. The
\add enemy\add* chariots and their drivers had come very close to Saul.
\v 7 Saul turned around and saw me, and he called out to me. I answered him and said, 'What do you want me to do?'
\p
\v 8 He replied, 'Who are you?' I replied, 'I am a descendant of Amalek.'
\p
\v 9 Then he said to me, 'Come over here and kill me. I am still alive, but I am suffering very much pain.'
\p
\v 10 So I went to him and killed him, because I knew that he was wounded very badly and would not continue to live\f + \ft Or: soon die \f*.
I took the crown that was on his head and the band\f + \ft Or: bracelet \f* that was on his arm, and I have brought them to you."
\p
\v 11 Then David and all the men who were with him tore their clothes
\add to show that they were very sad\add*. 
\v 12 They mourned for Saul and his son Jonathan, and they cried and fasted\f + \ft Or: abstained from eating food \f* until it was evening.
They also mourned for all the army of Yahweh, and for all the Israeli people, because many of their soldiers had been killed in
the battle \f + \ft metonymy \f*. 
\p
\v 13 Then David asked the young man who had told him \add about the
battle\add*, "Where are you from?" He replied, "My father is a descendant of Amalek, but we live in Israel."
\p
\v 14 David asked him, "Why were you not afraid \add that you would be punished if
you\add* killed Saul, whom Yahweh had appointed \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add to be the
king\add*?\f + \ft Or: You should have been afraid \add that you would be punished if
you\add* killed Saul, whom Yahweh had appointed \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add to be the
king\add*. \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* 
\v 15-16 You yourself said, 'I killed the man whom Yahweh appointed to be the king.' So you have caused yourself to be guilty
\f + \ft metonymy \f* of causing your own death!" Then David summoned one of his soldiers and said to him, "Kill him!" So the soldier killed
him by striking him \add with a sword\add*. 
\s David's song about Saul and Jonathan 
\p
\v 17 Then David composed\f + \ft Or: wrote \f* this sad song about Saul and Jonathan,
\v 18 and he commanded that it be taught to the people of Judah.
\add The song is called\add* 'The Bow \add and arrow\add*' and it has been written in the Book of Jashar:
\q
\v 19 You Israeli people, your glorious \f + \ft metonymy \f* leaders have been killed on the mountains!
\q2 \add It is very sad that\add* these mighty men have died! 
\b
\q
\v 20 Do not tell it to \add our enemies in the Philistia area\add*;
\q do not tell to the people who live in Gath \add city\add* what happened;
\q2 do not proclaim it in the streets of Ashkelon \add city\add*, because if you tell them,
\add even\add* the women in that area will be happy; 
\q2 do not allow those pagan women\f + \ft Or: women who do not know God \f* to rejoice.
\q
\v 21 I hope\f + \ft Or: desire \f* that there will be no rain or dew on the mountains of the Gilboa
\add area\add* \f + \ft apostrophe \f*, 
\q and that no grain will grow in the fields there, 
\q2 because there the shield of Saul, the mighty \add king\add*, fell on the ground.
\q No one rubbed \add olive\add* oil on Saul's shield; 
\q
\v 22 instead, it was stained with the blood of those whom he had killed,
\q2 and the fat of mighty enemy soldiers was smeared on it. 
\q Jonathan \f + \ft personification \f* did not retreat carrying his bow \add and arrows\add*,
\q2 and Saul always \add defeated his enemies when he fought them\add* with his sword. \f + \ft personification, litotes \f*
\b
\q
\v 23 Saul and Jonathan were loved and they pleased many people.
\q2 They were together \f + \ft litotes \f* while they lived and when they died.
\q \add In battles\add* they were swifter than eagles and they were stronger than lions.
\b
\q
\v 24 You Israeli women, cry about Saul; 
\q He provided beautiful scarlet\f + \ft Or: red \f* clothes for you 
\q2 and he gave you gold ornaments\f + \ft Or: jewelry \f* to fasten on those clothes.
\b
\q
\v 25  \add It is very sad that\add* this mighty soldier has died!
\q2 Jonathan has been killed on the mountains\f + \ft Or: hills \f*. 
\q
\v 26 Jonathan, my dear friend, I grieve for you; 
\q2 you were very dear to me. 
\q You loved me in a wonderful manner; 
\q2 it was better than the way that a woman loves \add her husband and her
children\add*. 
\b
\q
\v 27 It is very sad that these mighty men have died, 
\q2 and their weapons are now abandoned!
