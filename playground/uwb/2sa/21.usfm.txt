\c 21  
\s The people of Gibeon got revenge for what Saul did 
\p
\v 1 During the time that David \add ruled\add*, there was a famine
\add in Israel\add* for three years. David prayed to Yahweh about it. And Yahweh said,
“\add In order for the famine to end\add*, Saul's family need to be punished [MTY] because Saul killed many people from Gibeon
\add city\add*.” 
\p
\v 2 The people of Gibeon were not Israelis; they were a small group of the Amor people-group whom the Israelis had solemnly
promised to protect. But Saul had tried to kill all of them because he ◄was very zealous/wanted very much► to enable the people
of Judah and Israel \add to be the only ones living in that land\add*. So the king summoned the leaders of Gibeon
\v 3 and said to them, “What shall I do for you? How can I make amends/up for what was done to your people, in order that you
will bless us who belong to Yahweh?” 
\p
\v 4 They replied, “You cannot settle our quarrel with Saul and his family by giving us silver or gold. And we do not have the
right to kill any Israelis.” 
\p So David asked, “Then/So what do you say that I should do for you?”
\v 5 They replied, “Saul \add wanted to\add* get rid of us. He wanted to annihilate/kill all of us, in order that none of us
would live anywhere in Israel. 
\v 6 Put seven of Saul's descendants into our hands. We will hang them where Yahweh is worshiped in Gibeon, our town, the town
where Saul, whom Yahweh chose to be king, lived.” 
\p The king replied, “Okay, I will put them into your hands.” 
\v 7 The king did not put Saul's grandson Mephibosheth into their hands, because of what he and
\add Mephibosheth's father\add* Jonathan had solemnly promised to each other.
\v 8 Instead, he took Armoni and another man named Mephibosheth, the two sons that Saul's slave wife Rizpah, the daughter of
Aiah, had given birth to, and the five sons that Saul's daughter Merab had given birth to. Merab's husband was Adriel the son
of a man named Barzillai from Meholah \add town\add*. 
\v 9 David put these men into the hands of the men from Gibeon. Then they hanged those seven men on a hill where they worshiped
Yahweh. They were all killed during the time of the year that the people started to harvest the barley.
\p
\v 10 Then Rizpah took coarse cloth made from goats' hair, and spread it on the rock
\add where the corpses lay\add*. She stayed there from the time that people started to harvest the barley until the rains
started. She did not allow any birds to come near the corpses during the day, and she did not allow any animals to come near
during the night. 
\v 11 When someone told David what Rizpah had done, 
\v 12 he went with some of his servants to Jabesh in the Gilead \add region\add* and got the bones of Saul and his son
Jonathan. The people of Jabesh had stolen their bones from the ◄plaza/public square► in Beth-Shan
\add city\add*, where the men from Philistia had hanged them previously, on the day that they had killed Saul and Jonathan on
Gilboa Mountain. 
\v 13 David and his men took the bones of Saul and Jonathan, and they also took the bones of the seven men
\add from Gibeon\add* whom they had hanged. 
\p
\v 14 They buried the bones of Saul and Jonathan in Zela \add town\add* in the land of
\add the tribe of\add* Benjamin. Doing all that the king commanded, they buried their bones in the tomb where Saul's father
Kish \add was buried\add*. After that, \add because God saw that Saul's family had been punished to pay for Saul's murder of
many people from Gibeon\add*, he answered the Israelis' prayers for their land, and caused the famine to end.
\s The battles against the giants of Philistia 
\p
\v 15 The army of Philistia again started to fight against the army of Israel. And David and his soldiers went to fight them.
During the battle, David became weary. 
\v 16 One of the Philistia men thought that he could kill David. His name was Ishbi-Benob. He was a descendant of
\add a group of\add* giants. He carried a bronze spear that weighed about ◄7-1/2 pounds/3-1/2 kg.►, and he also had a new
sword. 
\v 17 But Abishai came to help David, and attacked the giant and killed him. Then David's soldiers forced him to promise that
he would not go with them into a battle again. They said to him,
“\add If you die, and none of your descendants become king, that would be
like\add* [MET] extinguishing the last light in Israel.” 
\p
\v 18 Some time after that, there was a battle with the army of Philistia near Gob
\add village\add*. During the battle, Sibbecai, from the Hushah \add clan\add*, killed Saph, one of the descendants of the
Rapha giants. 
\p
\v 19  \add Later\add* there was another battle with the army of Philistia at Gob. During that battle, Elhanan, the son of
Jaare-Oregim from Bethlehem, killed \add the brother of\add* Goliath from Gath
\add city\add*, whose spear shaft/handle was ◄very thick, like the bar on a weaver's loom/over two inches thick►.
\p
\v 20 Later there was another battle near Gath. There was a ◄huge man/giant► there who liked to fight
\add in battles\add*. He had six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot. He was descended from the Rapha
\add giants\add*. 
\v 21 But when he ◄made fun of/ridiculed► the men in the Israeli
\add army\add*, Jonathan, the son of David's \add older\add* brother Shimeah, killed him.
\p
\v 22 Those four men were some of the descendants of the Rapha giants who had lived in Gath, who were killed [MTY] by David and
his soldiers.
