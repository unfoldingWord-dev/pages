\c 15  
\s Absalom rebelled against David 
\p
\v 1 Some time later, Absalom acquired a chariot and horses \add to pull
it\add*. He \add hired\add* fifty men to run in front of him \add to honor him while he was riding around Jerusalem in the
chariot\add*. 
\v 2 Furthermore, he always rose early \add each morning\add* and stood by the city gate. Whenever someone came there with a
dispute/quarrel with someone that he wanted the king to decide, Absalom would call out to him, asking “What city are you from?”
When the person told him what \add city and\add* tribe he was from,
\v 3 Absalom would say to him, “Listen, \add I am sure that\add* what you are saying/claiming is right. But there is no one
whom the king has appointed/authorized to listen to \add people like\add* you.”
\v 4 Absalom would then add, “I wish that I were a judge in this land. If I were a judge, anyone who had a dispute could come
to me, and I would decide it fairly/justly.” 
\p
\v 5 And whenever anyone came near to Absalom to bow respectfully in front of him, Absalom would reach out and embrace him and
kiss him. 
\v 6 Absalom did this to everyone in Israel who came to the king because he had a dispute with someone. In that way, Absalom
persuaded all the Israeli people to be more pleased with him [IDI]
\add than they were pleased with David\add*. 
\p
\v 7 Four years later, Absalom \add went to\add* the king and said, “Please allow me to go to Hebron
\add city\add*, in order that I can do what I promised Yahweh that I would do.
\v 8 When I was living in Geshur, in Syria, I promised Yahweh that if he brought me back to Jerusalem, I would worship him
\add in Hebron\add*.” 
\p
\v 9 The king replied, “I will permit you to go safely/peacefully.” So Absalom went to Hebron.
\p
\v 10 But \add while he was there\add*, he secretly sent messengers to all the tribes in Israel, to tell them, “When you hear
the sound of the trumpets \add being blown\add*, shout ‘Absalom has become the king at Hebron!’ ”
\v 11 Absalom had taken with him to Hebron two hundred men from Jerusalem, but they did not know
\add what Absalom was planning to do\add*. 
\v 12 While Absalom was offering sacrifices \add at Hebron\add*, he sent a message to Ahithophel, from Giloh
\add town\add*, requesting him to come. Ahithophel was one of the king's advisors. So the number of people who joined Absalom
and who were ready to rebel \add against David\add* became larger.
\s David escaped from Jerusalem 
\p
\v 13 Soon a messenger came to David and said to him, “All \f + \fr hyperbole \f* the Israeli people \f + \fr synecdoche \f* are joining Absalom to rebel against
you!” 
\p
\v 14 So David said to all his officials, “We must leave immediately if we want to escape from Absalom! We must go quickly,
before he \add and his men\add* arrive. If we do not do that, they will kill us and everyone else in the city!”
\p
\v 15 The king's officials said, “Okay, your majesty, we are ready to do whatever you decide.”
\p
\v 16 So the king left ten of his slave wives there to take care of the palace, but all the other people in his palace went
with him. 
\v 17 When they all were leaving \add the city\add*, they stopped at the last house.
\v 18 The king and his officials stood there while his bodyguards went by in front of him. Six hundred soldiers from Gath
\add city\add* also walked by in front of him. 
\p
\v 19 Then David said to Ittai, \add the leader of\add* the soldiers from Gath, “◄Why are you going with us?/You should not be
going with us.► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* Go back and stay with \add Absalom the new\add* king. You are not an Israeli; you are living away from
your own land. 
\v 20 You have lived here \add in Israel\add* for only a short time \f + \fr hyperbole \f*. And we do not even know where we will be going. So
it is not right \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* for me to force you to wander around with us. And take your troops with you. And I hope/wish that Yahweh
will faithfully love and be loyal to you.” 
\p
\v 21 But Ittai replied, “Your Majesty, as surely as you live, wherever you go, I will go; I will stay with you, whether they
kill me {I am killed} or allow me {am allowed} to live.” 
\p
\v 22 David replied to Ittai, “Okay, march with us!” So Ittai and all his troops and their families went
\add with David\add* 
\p
\v 23 All the people \add along the road\add* cried when they saw them walking by. The king and all the others crossed the
Kidron Ravine/Valley and then they all went \add up the hill\add* toward the desert.
\p
\v 24 Abiathar and Zadok, \add the priests\add*, were walking with them. The descendants of Levi
\add who helped the priests\add* also went with them, carrying the sacred chest that contained the Ten Commandments. But they
set it on the ground until all the others had left the city. 
\p
\v 25 But then the king said to Zadok, “You two take the sacred chest back into the city. If Yahweh is pleased with me, he will
some day allow me to return to see it and the place where it is kept.
\v 26 But if he says that he is not pleased with me, then I am willing for him to do to me whatever he thinks is good.”
\p
\v 27 He also said to Zadok, “Listen \add to what I suggest\add*! Return to the city peacefully/safely, and take your son
Ahimaaz and Abiathar's son Jonathan with you. 
\v 28 I will wait in the desert at the place where people can walk across the river, until you send a message to me.”
\v 29 So Zadok and Abiathar carried the sacred chest back to Jerusalem, and they stayed there.
\p
\v 30 David \add and those with him\add* went up Olive Tree Hill. David was crying while he walked. He was walking barefoot and
had something covering his head \add to show that he was sorrowful\add*. All those who were going with him also covered their
heads and were crying while they walked. 
\v 31 Someone told David that Ahithophel had joined with those who were rebelling against David. So David prayed, “Yahweh,
cause whatever Ahithophel suggests to Absalom \add that he should do be
considered\add* to be foolish!” 
\p
\v 32 When they arrived at the top of the hill, where there was a place where the people worshiped
\add God\add*, suddenly Hushai, from the Arki people-group, met David. He had torn his clothes and put dirt on his head
\add to show that he was very sad\add*. 
\v 33 David said to him, “If you go with me, you will not be able to help me.
\v 34 But if you return to the city, \add you can help me by\add* saying to Absalom, ‘Your Majesty, I will serve you as
faithfully as I served your father.’ If you do that \add and stay near
Absalom\add*, you will be able to oppose any advice that Ahithophel gives to Absalom.
\v 35 Zadok and Abiathar the priests are already there \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*. Whatever you hear people say in the king's palace, tell it to
Zadok and Abiathar. 
\v 36 Keep in mind that Zadok's son Ahimaaz and Abiathar's son Jonathan are also there. You can tell them whatever you find
out, and send them to report it to me.” 
\p
\v 37 So David's friend Hushai returned to the city, at the same time that Absalom was entering Jerusalem.
