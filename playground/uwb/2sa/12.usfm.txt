\s Nathan rebuked David 
\p
\v 1 Yahweh told \add the prophet\add* Nathan \add what David had done,
and\add* he sent Nathan \add to tell this story\add* to David: “\add I heard
about\add* two men who were living In a certain city. One was rich and the other was poor.
\v 2 The rich man owned lot of cattle and sheep. 
\v 3 But the poor man had only one little female lamb, which he had bought. He raised the lamb, and it grew up with his
children. He would give the lamb some of his own food and let it drink from his cup. He let the lamb sleep in his arms. The
lamb was like a daughter to him. 
\p
\v 4  \add One day\add* a visitor came to \add visit\add* the rich man. The rich man did not want to take one of his own
animals \add and kill it\add* to prepare a meal for the visitor. So instead, he stole the poor man's lamb
\add and killed it\add* and prepared a meal for his visitor.” 
\p
\v 5 When David \add heard that\add*, he was very angry about what the rich man
\add had done\add*. He said to Nathan, “I solemnly declare that the man who did that should be executed!
\v 6 But before he is executed, he should pay back to the poor man four lambs for doing this, and for not having pity
\add on the poor man\add*.” 
\p
\v 7 Nathan said to David, “You are the man \add I have been talking
about\add*! And this is what Yahweh, the God we Israelis \add worship\add*, says to you: ‘I appointed you to be king of Israel,
after having rescued you from Saul. 
\v 8 I gave you his palace and his wives. I caused you to become the king to rule Israel and Judah. If
\add you had told me\add* that you were not content with what I gave you, I would have given you twice as much!
\v 9 So why have you despised my commandment \add about not committing
adultery\add*? You have done what I consider to be very evil! You have arranged for Uriah to be killed in a battle by the Ammon
people-group's soldiers, and you have taken his wife to be your wife!
\v 10 You have despised me, and have taken Uriah's wife to be your wife. So for many generations some of your descendants will
die violently. \f + \ft metonymy, personification \f* 
\v 11 I solemnly declare to you that I will cause someone from your own family to bring trouble to you. I will take your wives
and give them to him, and he will have sex with them in the daytime, where everyone can see it, and you will know all about it.
\v 12 What you did, you did secretly, but what I will cause to happen, everyone in Israel will be able to see it
\add or know about it\add*. [IDI]’ ” 
\p
\v 13 David replied, “I have sinned against Yahweh.” Nathan said to David, “Yahweh has overlooked your sin: you will not die
\add because of this sin\add*. 
\v 14 But, you have shown contempt for Yahweh by doing this. So, your baby will die.”
\p
\v 15 Then Nathan went home. 
\s David's baby died 
\m Then Yahweh caused the baby, the one that Uriah's wife had given birth to, to become very sick.
\v 16 So David prayed to God that the child \add would not die\add*. He fasted\f + \ft Or: abstained from food \f*, and he went into
\add the room where he slept\add* and lay all night on the floor.
\v 17  \add The next morning\add* his most important servants stood around him and tried to urge him to get up. But he would
not get up, and he would not eat any food with them. 
\p
\v 18 One week later the baby died. David's servants were afraid to tell that to David. They said
\add to each other\add*, “Hey, while the baby was still alive, we talked to him, but he would not answer us. Now, if we tell
him that the baby is dead \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*, he may do something to harm himself!”
\p
\v 19 But when David saw that his servants were whispering something to each other, he realized that the baby must be dead. So
he asked them, “Is the baby dead?” They replied, “Yes, he is dead.”
\p
\v 20 Then David got up from the floor. He bathed himself, put lotions on his body, and put on other clothes, Then he went into
Yahweh's Sacred Tent and worshiped Yahweh. Then he went home. He requested his servants for some food. They gave him some, and
he ate it. 
\p
\v 21 Then his servants said to him, “We do not understand \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* why you have done this! While the baby was still alive, you
cried for him and refused to eat anything. But now that the baby has died,
\add you are not crying anymore\add* You got up and ate some food!”
\p
\v 22 He replied, “While the baby was still alive, I fasted and cried. I thought, ‘Who knows? Yahweh may act mercifully toward
me and not allow the baby to die’. 
\v 23 But now the baby is dead. So ◄there is no reason for me to ‘fast\f + \ft Or: abstain \f* from eating food’ anymore.\f + \ft Or: why \f* should I
‘fast\f + \ft Or: abstain \f* from eating food’ anymore?► \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* Can I bring him back to me?\f + \ft Or: I certainly cannot bring him back to me! \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\add Some day\add* I will go to where he is, but he will not return to me.”
\p
\v 24 Then David comforted his wife, Bathsheba. Then he slept\f + \ft Or: had sex \f* with her, and she
\add became pregnant\add*, and gave birth to another son. David named that son Solomon. Yahweh loved this little boy.
\v 25 He told the prophet Nathan to tell David to name the baby boy Jedediah
\add which means ‘loved by Yahweh’\add*, because Yahweh loved him.
\s David's army captured Rabbah 
\p
\v 26 Meanwhile\f + \ft Or: While all that was happening \f*, Joab's \add soldiers\add* attacked Rabbah,
\add the capital city\add* of the Ammon \add people-group\add*; and they captured the king's fortress.
\v 27 Then Joab sent messengers to David, to tell him this: “My troops are attacking Rabbah, and we have captured the city's
water supply. 
\v 28 Now gather your troops and come and surround the city and capture it. If you do not do that, my troops will capture the
city and it will then be named 'the City of Joab.' ” 
\p
\v 29 So David gathered all his troops. They went to Rabbah and attacked it and captured it.
\v 30 Then David took the crown from the head of the king of Rabbah \f + \ft Or: from the head of
\add Milcom\add* the god of Rabbah \f* and put it on his own head. It
\add was very heavy\add*; it weighed 75 pounds\f + \ft Or: 34 kg. \f*, and it had many very valuable stones fastened to it. His soldiers also
took many other valuable things from the city. 
\v 31 Then they brought the people out of the city and forced them to
\add work for them\add*, using saws and iron picks and axes. David's troops also forced them to make bricks. David's soldiers
did this in all the towns of the Ammon people-group. Then David and all of his army returned to Jerusalem.
