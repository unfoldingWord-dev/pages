\c 4  
\s Ishbosheth was murdered 
\p
\v 1 When Saul's son Ishbosheth heard that Abner had been killed at Hebron, he
\add realized that he might also be killed\add*. He became discouraged, and all the Israeli people trembled\f + \ft Or: became afraid \f*.
\v 2 Ishbosheth had two officers who were leaders of groups that raided other villages. They
\add were brothers\add*; their names were Baanah and Rechab, sons of Rimmon from Beeroth
\add town\add* in the tribe of Benjamin. Beeroth is in the area that had
\add been assigned to\add* the tribe of Benjamin. 
\v 3 But the people of Beeroth had fled to Gittaim \add town\add*, and they still live there.
\p
\v 4 Saul's son Jonathan had a son named Mephibosheth. When Mephibosheth was five years old, Saul and Jonathan died in the
battle. When people brought that news from Jezreel, Mephibosheth's nursemaid picked him up and ran away, but she ran very fast,
with the result that she dropped him, and his legs became crippled.
\p
\v 5 One day, Rechab and Baanah left \add their home\add* to go to Ishbosheth's house. They arrived there about noontime, when
Ishbosheth was taking his midday nap. 
\v 6 The woman who was the doorkeeper was sifting wheat; but she became sleepy, and fell asleep. So Rechab and his brother
Baanah were able to creep in quietly. 
\p
\v 7 They entered Ishbosheth's bedroom, where he was sleeping. They killed him
\add with their swords\add* and cut off his head. They carried his head and walked all night through the Jordan Valley.
\v 8 They took the head of Ishbosheth to David at Hebron. They said to him, "Here is the head of Ishbosheth, the son of your
enemy Saul, who tried to kill you. Your majesty, today Yahweh has allowed you to get revenge on Saul and his descendants!"
\p
\v 9 But David replied to them, "Yahweh is the one who has rescued me from all my enemies\f + \ft Or: difficulties \f*. And just as surely as
Yahweh lives, what I am now saying is also true. 
\v 10 When a messenger came to Ziklag and told me 'Saul is dead!' and he thought that the news that he was bringing to me was
good news, I seized him and \add commanded one of my soldiers to\add* kill him. That was the reward I gave to him for his news!
\v 11 So because you two evil men murdered a man who is innocent\f + \ft Or: has done nothing wrong \f* when he was sleeping on his bed in
his own house, I will do something worse to you. I will surely \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* get revenge on you two for murdering \f + \ft metonymy \f* him, and wipe
you\f + \ft Or: cause you to disappear \f* from the earth!" 
\p
\v 12 Then David gave a command to his soldiers, and they killed the two men, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hung
their bodies \f + \ft Or: their hands and feet \f* \add on a pole\add* near the pool at Hebron. But they took the head of Ishbosheth and
buried it \add respectfully\add* in the tomb of Abner, there at Hebron.
