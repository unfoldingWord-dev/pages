\s David became the king of all the Israeli tribes 
\p
\v 1 Then \add the leaders of\add* all the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron, and said to him, “Listen, we have the same
ancestors [IDI] that you do. 
\v 2 In the past, when Saul was our king, it was you who led our Israeli soldiers
\add in our battles\add*. You are the one to whom Yahweh promised, ‘You will be the leader \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* of my people; you will be
their king.’ ” 
\p
\v 3 So while Yahweh was listening, all those leaders of the people of Israel declared there at Hebron
\add that David would be their king\add*. And David made a sacred agreement with them. They anointed him
\add with olive oil to set him apart\add* to be the king of the Israeli people.
\v 4 David was thirty years old when he became their king. He ruled them for forty years.
\v 5 In Hebron he ruled over the tribe of Judah for seven and a half years, and in Jerusalem he ruled over all the people of
Judah and Israel for thirty-three years. 
\s David's army captured Jerusalem 
\p
\v 6  \add One day\add* King David and his soldiers went to Jerusalem to fight against the Jebus people-group who lived there.
The people there thought that David's army would not be able to capture the city, so they said to David, “Your army will never
be able to get inside our city! Even the blind and crippled people will be able to chase you away!”
\v 7 But David's army captured the fortress on Zion \add Hill\add*,
\add and later it was known as\add* David's City. 
\v 8 On that day, David said \add to his soldiers\add*, “Those who want to get rid of the Jebus people-group should go through
the water tunnel \add to enter the city\add*. Then they can attack those people whom I \\f + \\ft synecdoche \\f* detest—and
\add we will find out if any\add* blind and crippled people \add will be able to stop
them\add*!” That is why people say, “Blind and crippled people cannot enter Yahweh's temple.”
\p
\v 9 After \add David and his soldiers captured\add* the city with its strong walls around it, he lived there, and they named
it ‘David's City.’ David \add and his soldiers\add* built the city around the fortress, starting where the
\add land was ◄filled in\f + \ft Or: terraces \f*► on the east side of the hill\add*.
\v 10 David continued to become more and more powerful\f + \ft Or: influential \f*, because the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels was
with\f + \ft Or: helping \f* him. 
\b
\p
\v 11  \add One day\add* Hiram, the king of Tyre \add city\add*, sent ambassadors\f + \ft Or: messengers \f* to David
\add to talk about making agreements between their countries\add*. Hiram agreed to provide cedar trees
\add to make lumber\add*, and also that he would send carpenters and masons, to build a palace for David.
\v 12 His doing that caused David to realize that Yahweh truly had appointed him to be the king of Israel, and that Yahweh was
going to cause his kingdom to prosper, because Yahweh loved the Israeli people, whom
\add he had chosen to\add* belong to him. 
\p
\v 13 After David moved from Hebron to Jerusalem, he took more slave women to be his wives, and he also married other women.
\add All of those women\add* gave birth to more sons and daughters.
\v 14 The names of the sons who were born in Jerusalem were Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,
\v 15 Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia, 
\v 16 Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphelet. 
\s David's army defeated the Philistines 
\p
\v 17 When the Philistia people heard that David had been appointed to be the king of Israel, their army went up
\add toward Jerusalem\add* to try to capture David. But David heard that they were coming, so he went down to another fortified
place. 
\v 18 The \add army of\add* Philistia arrived at Rephaim Valley \add southwest of
Jerusalem\add* and spread all over the valley. 
\v 19 David asked Yahweh, “Should \add my men\add* and I attack the Philistia army? Will you enable us to defeat them [IDI]?”
Yahweh replied, “Yes, attack them, because I will certainly enable your army to defeat them. [IDI]”
\p
\v 20 So David \add and his army\add* went to \add where the Philistia army
was\add*, and there they defeated them. Then David said, “Yahweh has burst through my enemies like a flood. \\f + \\ft simile \\f*” So that
place is called ‘Lord of bursting-through.’ 
\v 21 The Philistia men left their idols there; so David and his soldiers took them away.
\p
\v 22 Then the Philistia \add army\add* returned to Rephaim Valley and spread all over the valley.
\v 23 So again David asked Yahweh \add if his army should attack
them\add*. But Yahweh replied, “Do not attack them \add from here\add*. Tell your men to go around them and attack them from
the other side, near the balsam trees. 
\v 24 When you hear something in the tops of the balsam trees that sounds like
\add an army\add* marching, attack them, because I will have gone ahead of you
\add to enable your army\add* to defeat their army.” 
\v 25 So David did what Yahweh told him to do, and his \add army\add* defeated the Philistia army from Geba
\add city\add* all the way \add west\add* to Gezer \add city\add*.
