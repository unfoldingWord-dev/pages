\c 20  
\s Sheba rebelled against David 
\p
\v 1 There was a man there \add at Gilgal\add* named Sheba. He was man who always caused trouble. He was from the tribe of
Benjamin, the son of Bichri. He blew a trumpet and called out, “We have nothing to do with \f + \ft doublet \f* David, that son of Jesse! So,
men of Israel, let's go to our homes!” 
\p
\v 2 So all the men from the Israeli tribes deserted David and went with Sheba, but the men of Judah stayed with David. They
wanted him to be their king, and went with him from near the Jordan
\add River\add* up to Jerusalem. 
\p
\v 3 When David arrived at the palace in Jerusalem, he took the ten slave wives whom he had left there to take care of the
palace and put them in another house. He put a guard at that house, and he provided for them what they needed, but he never had
sex \f + \ft euphemism \f* with them again. So they remained shut up in their house until they died. It was as though they were widows.
\p
\v 4  \add One day\add* the king said to Amasa, “Summon the soldiers of Judah to come here within three days, and you be here
also.” 
\v 5 So Amasa went to summon them, but he did not return within the time that David told him to.
\p
\v 6 So David said to Abishai, “Now Sheba will harm us more than Absalom did. So you take my soldiers and pursue him. If you do
not do that, he and his soldiers may occupy\f + \ft Or: capture \f* some of the fortified towns\f + \ft Or: towns that have walls around them \f*, and escape
from us. [IDI]” 
\v 7 So Abishai \add and Joab\add* and the king's bodyguards and the other soldiers left Jerusalem, to pursue Sheba.
\p
\v 8 When they arrived at the huge rock in the Gibeah \add region\add*, Amasa met them. Joab was wearing a soldier's uniform.
He had a dagger\f + \ft Or: long \f* knife fastened to his belt. When he came close
\add to Amasa, he allowed\add* the dagger to fall on the ground.
\p
\v 9 Joab said to Amasa, “Are things going well with you, my friend?” Then Joab grabbed Amasa's beard with his right hand, in
order to kiss him. 
\v 10 But Amasa did not see that Joab was holding \add another\add* dagger in his
\add other\add* hand. And Joab stabbed it into Amasa's belly, and his insides spilled out onto the ground. Amasa died
\add immediately\add*; Joab did not need to stab him again. Then Joab and his brother Abishai continued to pursue Sheba.
\p
\v 11 One of Joab's soldiers stood alongside Amasa's body and called out, “Everyone who wants Joab
\add to be our commander\add* and who wants David \add to be our
king\add*, go with Joab!” 
\v 12 Amasa's body was lying on the road. It was covered with blood. The soldier of Joab
\add who had called out\add* saw that many other of Joab's soldiers were stopping
\add to see it\add*, so he dragged Amasa's body off the road into a field, and threw a cloth\f + \ft Or: blanket \f* over the body.
\v 13 After the body had been taken off the road, all the soldiers went with Joab to pursue Sheba.
\p
\v 14 Sheba went through all the tribes of Israel, and arrived at Abel-Beth-Maacah
\add town in the northern part of Israel\add*. There, all the members of
\add his father\add* Bichri's clan gathered, and went with Sheba into the town.
\v 15 The soldiers who were with Joab \add found out that Sheba had gone
there\add*, so they went there and surrounded the town. They built a dirt ramp up against the town wall. They also pounded
against the wall \add with heavy poles\add*, to cause it to collapse.
\v 16 Then a wise woman who was in that town \add stood on the top of the
wall\add* and shouted down, “Listen to me! Tell Joab to come here, because I want to talk to him!”
\v 17 So \add after they told Joab\add*, he came there, and the woman said, “Are you Joab?”
\p He replied, “Yes, I am.” She said to him, “Listen to what I say.” He replied, “I am listening.”
\v 18 She said, “Long ago people used to say, ‘Go to Abel \add town\add* to get good advice about your problems.’ And that is
what people did. 
\v 19 We are peaceful and loyal Israelis. Our people here are important and respected [IDI]. So why are you trying to destroy
a town that belongs to Yahweh?\f + \ft Or: you should not be trying to destroy a town that belongs to Yahweh. \f*” \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\p
\v 20 Job replied, “I would certainly never want to ruin or destroy your town!
\v 21 That is not what we want to do. But Bichri's son Sheba, a man from the hilly area in the tribe of Ephraim, is rebelling
against King David. Put this man into our hands, and then we will go away from\f + \ft Or: not attack \f* this town.”
\p The woman replied to Joab, “Okay, what we will do is, we will
\add cut off\add* his head and throw it over the wall to you.” 
\p
\v 22 Then this wise woman went to the elders of the town and told them what she had said to Joab. So they cut off Sheba's head
and threw it over the wall to Joab. Then Joab blew his trumpet \add to signal that the battle was
ended\add*, and all his soldiers left the town and returned to their homes. And Joab returned to Jerusalem and told the king
\add what had happened\add*. 
\p
\v 23 Joab was the commander of the entire Israeli army. Jehoiada's son Benaiah was the commander of David's bodyguards;
\v 24 Adoram supervised the men who were forced to work \add for the
king\add*; Ahilud's son Jehoshaphat was the man who reported \add to the people everything that David
decided\add*; 
\v 25 Sheva was the official secretary; Zadok and Abiathar were the priests;
\v 26 and Ira from Jair \add town\add* was also one of David's priests.
