\s Amnon raped Absalom's sister 
\p
\v 1 David's son Absalom had a beautiful half-sister named Tamar. Another of David's sons, Amnon, was attracted to Tamar.
\v 2 He wanted \add to have sex with\add* \f + \fr euphemism \f* his half-sister very much, with the result that he felt sick. But it was not
possible for Amnon to get her, because she was a virgin, \add so they kept men away from
her\add*. 
\p
\v 3 But Amnon had a friend named Jonadab, who was the son of David's brother Shimeah. Jonadab was a very crafty/shrewd man.
\p
\v 4  \add One day\add* Jonadab said to Amnon, “You are the king's son, but every day I see that \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* you seem very
depressed/sad. What is your problem?” Amnon replied, “I ◄am in love/want to sleep► \f + \fr euphemism \f* with Tamar, my half-brother Absalom's
sister.” 
\p
\v 5 Jonadab said to him, “Lie down on your bed, and pretend that you are sick. When your father comes to see you, say to him,
‘Allow my half-sister Tamar to come and give me some food to eat. She can prepare the food while I am watching her. Then she
can serve it to me herself.’ ” 
\p
\v 6 So Amnon lay down, and pretended that he was sick. When the king came to see him, Amnon said to him,
“\add I am sick\add*; please allow my half-sister Tamar come and make a couple scones/dumplings for me while I am watching, and
then she can serve them to me.” 
\p
\v 7 So David sent a message to Tamar in the palace, saying “Amnon
\add is sick and he wants you to\add* go to his house and prepare some food for him.”
\v 8 So Tamar went to Amnon's house, where he was lying in bed. She took some dough and kneaded it, and formed them into some
scones/dumplings while he was watching her. Then she baked them.
\v 9 She took them out of the pan and put them \add on a plate\add* in front of him, but he refused to eat them. Then he said,
“All the rest of you, leave me!” So all the others left his \add room\add*.
\p
\v 10 Then Amnon said to Tamar, “Bring the food into my room and serve it to me.” So Tamar took into his room the
scones/dumplings that she had made. 
\v 11 But when she brought them close for him to eat them, he grabbed her and said to her, “Come to bed with me!”
\p
\v 12 She replied, “No, do not force me to do such a disgraceful thing! We never do things like that in Israel! That would be
awful/terrible! 
\v 13 As for me, if I did that, I would not be able to \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* endure being disgraced by having done that. And as for you,
everyone in Israel would condemn you for having done such a disgraceful deed. So I plead with you, talk to the king. I am sure
that he will allow me to marry you.” 
\v 14 But he would not heed her. He was stronger than she was, so he forced her to have sex with him.
\p
\v 15 Then Amnon hated her very much. He hated her much more than he had desired her. He said to her, “Get up and get out of
here!” 
\p
\v 16 But she said to him, “No! It would be very wrong for you to send me away. It would be worse than what you just did to
me!” But he would not heed her. 
\p
\v 17 He summoned his personal servant and said to him, “Take this woman outside, away from me, and lock the door
\add so that she cannot come in again\add*!” 
\v 18 So the servant put her outside and locked the door. 
\p Tamar was wearing a long robe with long sleeves, which was the clothing that was usually worn by the unmarried daughters of
the king at that time. 
\v 19 But Tamar tore the long robe that she was wearing, and put ashes on her head
\add to show that she was very sad\add*. Then she put her hands on her head
\add to show that she was grieving\add*, and she went away, crying.
\p
\v 20 Her brother Absalom \add saw her and\add* said to her, “Has your half-brother Amnon \f + \fr doublet \f* forced you to have sex with him
\f + \fr euphemism \f*? Please, my sister, do not tell anyone (OR, do not become depressed/sad).” So Tamar went to live in Absalom's house, and
she was very sad and lonely. 
\p
\v 21 When King David heard about all this, he became very angry.
\v 22 And Absalom hated Amnon, because he had raped his sister, so he would not speak to Amnon about anything.
\p
\v 23 Two years later, Absalom's servants were shearing sheep at Baal-Hazor, which is near
\add a town named\add* Ephraim. \add When they finished shearing the sheep, they
celebrated\add*, and Absalom invited all the king's sons \add to come and
celebrate\add*. 
\v 24 Absalom went to the king and said to him, “Sir, my servants have been shearing my sheep. Please come with your officials
\add to celebrate\add* with us!” 
\p
\v 25 But the king replied, “No, my son, it would not be good for all of us to go, because it would cause you to do a lot of
work and spend a lot of money for food.” Absalom continued urging him, but the king would not go. Instead, he said that he
hoped/desired that God would bless \add them while they celebrated\add*.
\p
\v 26 Then Absalom said, “If you will not go, please allow my half-brother Amnon to go with us.” But the king replied, “Why
\add do you want\add* him to go with you?” 
\p
\v 27 But Absalom continued to insist, so finally the king permitted Amnon and all David's other sons to go with Absalom.
\p
\v 28  \add So they all went. And at the celebration\add*, Absalom commanded his servants, “Notice when Amnon has become a bit
drunk from the wine. Then when I signal to you, kill him. Do not be afraid; you will be doing this
\add only\add* because I told you \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* to do it. So be courageous and do it!”
\v 29 So Absalom's servants did what Absalom told them to do. \add They killed
Amnon\add*. All the rest of David's sons \add saw what happened and\add* fled, riding on their mules.
\p
\v 30 While they were on their way home, someone \add went quickly
and\add* reported to David, “Absalom has killed all of your other sons; none of them is still alive!”
\v 31 The king stood up, tore his clothes \add because he was extremely
sad\add*, and then he threw himself down on the ground. All the servants who were there also tore their clothes.
\p
\v 32 But Jonadab, the son of David's brother Shimeah, said, “Your Majesty,
\add I am sure that\add* they have not killed all your sons. \add I am sure
that\add* only Amnon is dead, because Absalom has determined to do this ever since the day that Amnon raped \f + \fr euphemism \f* his
half-sister Tamar. 
\v 33 So, your majesty, do not believe the report that all your sons are dead.
\add I am sure that\add* only Amnon is dead.” 
\p
\v 34 In the meantime, Absalom ran away. 
\p Just then, the soldier/sentry who was \add standing on the city
wall\add* saw a large crowd of people coming down the hill along the road from Horonaim.
\add He ran and told the king what he had seen\add*. 
\v 35 Jonadab said to the king, “Aha! What I told you is true. Your other sons
\add are alive and\add* have come!” 
\p
\v 36 And as soon as he said that, David's sons came in. They all started crying, and David and all his officials also cried
very greatly. 
\p
\v 37-38 But Absalom had fled. He went to stay with the king of the Geshur
\add region\add*, who was Talmai the son of Ammihud. Absalom stayed there for three years.
\p David mourned for his son Amnon for a long time, 
\v 39 but after that, he desired very much to see Absalom, because he was no longer grieving about Amnon being dead.
