\s They moved the sacred chest to Jerusalem 
\p
\v 1 Then David chose 30,000 Israeli men and gathered them together.
\v 2 He led them to the place in Judah \add formerly\add* called Baalah,
\add now called Kiriath-Jearim\add*. They went in order to bring from there
\add to Jerusalem\add* the sacred chest, which had the name of Yahweh, the leader of the armies of
\add the angels in\add* heaven, written on it, and which had the
\add statues of the\add* winged creatures on top of it. Between those statues was where Yahweh spoke messages about ruling his
people \f + \fr metonymy \f*. 
\v 3 The sacred chest was in the house of Abinadab, on top of a hill. They went there, and put the chest on a new cart. Uzzah
and Ahio, the two sons of Abinadab, were guiding \add the oxen that were pulling the
cart\add*. 
\v 4 Uzzah walked alongside the cart, and Ahio walked in front of it.
\v 5 David and all the Israeli men were celebrating in God's presence, singing with all their strength and
\add playing\add* lyres and harps, and beating tambourines, and clashing castanets and cymbals.
\p
\v 6 But when they came to the place where Nacon threshed grain, the oxen stumbled. So Uzzah put his hand on the sacred chest
to ◄steady it/prevent it from falling \add off the cart\add*►. 
\v 7 Yahweh immediately became very angry with Uzzah, and killed him right there alongside the sacred chest, because he had
touched the chest, \add and Yahweh had commanded that only the descendants of Levi who help the priests should touch the sacred
chest\add*. 
\p
\v 8 But David was angry because Yahweh had punished Uzzah. So ever since that time, that place has been called ‘The Punishment
of Uzzah.’ 
\p
\v 9 Then David was afraid of what else Yahweh \add would do to punish
them\add*, so he said, “◄How can I/I am afraid to► take the sacred chest with me
\add to Jerusalem\add*.” 
\v 10 So he did not want to take the sacred chest to Jerusalem. Instead, they took it to another place; they took it to the
house of Obed-Edom, from Gath \add city\add*. 
\v 11 They left the sacred chest in the house of Obed-Edom for three months, and
\add during that time\add* Yahweh blessed Obed-Edom and his family.
\p
\v 12 Later, people told David, “Yahweh has blessed Obed-Edom and his family because
\add he is taking care of\add* the sacred chest!” When David heard that, he
\add and some other men\add* went to Obed-Edom's house, and very joyfully brought the sacred chest from there to Jerusalem.
\v 13 When the men who were carrying the sacred chest had walked only six steps, they stopped, and there David killed a bull
and a fat calf, and offered them to Yahweh for a sacrifice. 
\v 14 David was wearing only a linen cloth wrapped around his waist, and was dancing very energetically to honor Yahweh.
\v 15 David and the Israeli men took the sacred chest up \add to
Jerusalem\add*, shouting \add loudly\add* and blowing trumpets. 
\p
\v 16 While they were carrying the sacred chest into the city, \add his
wife\add* Michal, who was Saul's daughter, looked out the window of her
\add house\add*. She saw King David leaping and dancing to honor Yahweh. But she was disgusted with him.
\p
\v 17 They brought the sacred chest into the tent that David had erected for it. Then David gave to Yahweh offerings to be
completely burned \add on an altar\add*, and other offerings to restore fellowship with Yahweh.
\v 18 When David had finished offering those sacrifices, he \add asked\add* Yahweh, the leader of the armies of
\add angels in\add* heaven, to bless the people. 
\v 19 He also distributed food to all the people. To each Israeli man and woman he gave a loaf of bread, some meat, and a
raisin cake. Then all the people returned to their homes. 
\p
\v 20 When David went home to \add ask Yahweh to\add* bless his family, his wife Michal came out to meet him. She said to him,
“Maybe you, the king of Israel, \add think that\add* \f + \fr irony \f* you were honoring yourself today, but really, you acted like a fool,
uncovering yourself while the female servants of your officials were watching!”
\p
\v 21 David replied to Michal, “\add I was doing that\add* to honor Yahweh, who chose me instead of your father and other
members of his family, to be the king of the Israeli people, the people who belong to Yahweh. And I will
\add continue to\add* dance to honor Yahweh! 
\v 22  \add Even though you think that what I did\add* was disgraceful, I will continue to do it even more. You may despise me
\add because of what I did\add*, but the women whom you were talking about will honor me!”
\p
\v 23  \add As a result\add*, Saul's daughter never gave birth to any children.
