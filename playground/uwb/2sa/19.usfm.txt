\c 19  
\s Joab rebuked the king 
\p
\v 1 Someone told Joab that the king was crying and mourning because Absalom had died.
\v 2 All of David's soldiers became sad instead of rejoicing about defeating
\add the soldiers who had fought with Absalom\add*, because they heard that the king was mourning because Absalom
\add was dead\add*. 
\v 3 The soldiers returned to the city quietly, like \f + \ft simile \f* soldiers do when they are ashamed because they ran away from battle.
\v 4 The king covered his face \add with his hands\add* and kept crying loudly, “O, my son Absalom! O, Absalom, my son! My
son!” 
\p
\v 5 Then Joab entered \add the room where\add* the king was, and said to the king, “Today you have caused your soldiers to be
ashamed! You have humiliated the men who saved your life and the lives of your sons and daughters and your ordinary wives and
your slave wives! 
\v 6  \add It seems that\add* you love those who hate you and that you hate those who love you. You have caused it to be clear
today that your commanders and your officers are not at all important to you. I think that if Absalom were still alive and we
were all dead today, you would be happy. 
\v 7 So, now go and thank your soldiers \add for what they did\add*. Because I solemnly declare that if you do not do that,
none of them will still be with you by tomorrow morning and that would be worse
\add for you\add* than all the disasters\f + \ft Or: troubles \f* that you have experienced since you were a boy.”
\p
\v 8 So the king got up and went and sat near the city gate. And all the people were told, “Hey, the king is sitting at the
gate!” So they all came and gathered around him. 
\s The people of Israel and Judah wanted David to be their king again
\p Meanwhile, all the Israeli troops \add who had been with Absalom\add* had returned to their homes.
\p
\v 9 Then all the people throughout the tribes of Israel started to quarrel among themselves. They said to each other, “King
David rescued us from the people of Philistia and from our other enemies. But now he has fled from Absalom and left Israel!
\v 10 We appointed \f + \ft metonymy \f* Absalom to be our king, but he died in the battle
\add against David's soldiers\add*. So ◄why does someone not try to bring King David back?\f + \ft Or: surely \f* someone should try to bring
King David back.►” \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* 
\p
\v 11 King David \add found out what the people were saying. So\add* he sent the two priests, Zadok and Abiathar, to say to the
leaders of Judah, “The king says that he has heard that all the Israeli people
\add want him to be king again\add*. And he says, ‘◄Why should you be the last ones to bring me back to my palace?\f + \ft Or: It \f* is not
right that you be the last ones to bring me back to my palace.► \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 12 You are my relatives; we have the same ancestor [IDI]. So ◄why should you be the last ones to bring me back?\f + \ft Or: you \f* should
certainly not be the last ones to bring me back.► \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*’ ” 
\v 13 And say to Amasa, “You are one of my relatives. I hope\f + \ft Or: desire \f* that God will slit my throat [IDI] if I do not appoint you
to be, from now on, the commander of my army instead of Joab.” 
\p
\v 14  \add By sending that message to them\add*, David convinced all the people of Judah [IDI]
\add that they should be loyal to him\f + \ft Or: accept him as their king\add* \f*. So they sent a message to the king, saying “We want you
and all your officials to return here.” 
\v 15 So the king \add and his officials started back toward Jerusalem\add*. When they reached the Jordan
\add River\add*, the people of Judah came there to Gilgal to meet the king, and to bring him across the river.
\p
\v 16 Shimei, the man from the tribe of Benjamin, also came down quickly
\add to the river\add* with the people of Judah to meet King David.
\v 17 There were a thousand men from the tribe of Benjamin who came with him. And Ziba, who had been the servant of Saul, also
hurried down to the Jordan \add River\add*, bringing twenty of his servants with him. They all came to the king,
\v 18 and then they all \add prepared to\add* take the king and all his family across the river, at the place where they could
walk across it. They wanted to do whatever the king wanted them to do. As the king was about to cross the river, Shimei came to
him and prostrated himself in front of the king. 
\p
\v 19 He said to the king, “Your Majesty, please forgive me. Please do not keep thinking about the terrible thing that I did on
the day that you left Jerusalem. Do not think about it anymore. 
\v 20 Because I know that I have sinned. Look, I have come today, the first one from the northern tribes to come here to greet
you today, Your Majesty.” 
\p
\v 21 But Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, said, “He cursed the one that Yahweh appointed \f + \ft metonymy \f* to be the king! So should he not
be executed for doing that?\f + \ft Or: he certainly should be executed for doing that. \f*” \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\p
\v 22 But David said, “You sons of Zeruiah, what am I going to do with you? \f + \ft Or: you are not the ones who should decide
\add what to do to him\add* \f*. \add It is as though\add* you have become one of my enemies today. I know that I am the one who
has now become the king of Israel, \add so I say that\add* certainly no one \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* in Israel should be executed today.”
\v 23 Then the king said to Shimei, “I solemnly promise that I will not execute you.”
\p
\v 24 Then Miphibosheth, Saul's grandson, came down \add to the river\add* to greet the king. He had not washed his feet or
trimmed his beard or washed his clothes, from the time that the king left Jerusalem until the day that he returned.
\v 25 When he arrived from Jerusalem to greet the king, the king said to him, “Mephibosheth, why did you not go with me?”
\p
\v 26 He replied, “Your Majesty, \add you know that\add* I am crippled.
\add When I heard that you were leaving Jerusalem\add*, I said to my servant
\add Ziba\add*, ‘Put a saddle on my donkey in order that I can ride on it and go with the king.’ But he deceived me
\add and left without me\add*. 
\v 27 He lied to you about me. But, Your Majesty, you are \add as
wise\add* as God's angel. So do whatever seems right to you. 
\v 28 All of my grandfather's family expected\f + \ft Or: deserved \f* that we would be executed. But you
\add did not execute me\add*; you allowed me to eat food with you at your table! So I certainly do not have \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* the right to
request you for anything more.” 
\p
\v 29 The king replied, “You certainly do not need to say anymore. I have decided that you and Ziba will divide
\add equally\add* the land \add that belonged to your grandfather
Saul\add*.” 
\p
\v 30 Mephibosheth replied to the king, “Your Majesty, \add I am content
that\add* you have returned safely. So allow him to take all the land.”
\p
\v 31 Barzillai, the man from the Gilead \add region\add*, had come down to the Jordan
\add River\add* from \add his town of\add* Rogelim, to escort the king across the river.
\v 32 Barzillai was a very old man, eighty years old. He was a very wealthy man, and he had provided food for the king
\add and his soldiers\add* while they were at Mahanaim. 
\v 33 The king said to Barzillai, “Come with me to Jerusalem, and I will take care of you.”
\p
\v 34 But Barzillai replied, “I certainly do not have \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* many more years to live. So why should I go with you to
Jerusalem?\f + \ft Or: there is certainly no reason for me to go with you to Jerusalem. \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 35 I am now eighty years old. I do not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* know what is enjoyable and what is not enjoyable. I cannot \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* enjoy what I
eat and what I drink. I cannot \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* hear the voices of men and women as they sing. So why should I be another burden to
you?\f + \ft Or: I do not want to be another burden to you. \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* 
\v 36 I will cross the Jordan \add River\add* with you and go a little further, and that will be all the reward that I need
\add for helping you\add*. 
\v 37 Then please allow me to return to my home, because that is where I want to die, near my parents' grave. But here is
\add my son\add* Chimham. Your Majesty, allow him to go with you
\add and serve you\add*, and do for him whatever seems good to you!”
\p
\v 38 The king replied, “Okay, he will cross \add the river\add* with me, and I will do for him whatever seems good to you. And
I will do for you whatever you want me to do.” 
\p
\v 39 Then King David and all the others crossed the Jordan \add River\add*. He kissed Barzillai and
\add asked God to\add* bless him. Then Barzillai returned to his home.
\p
\v 40  \add After they crossed the river\add*, Chimham went with the king, and all the army of Judah and half the army of the
other Israeli tribes escorted\f + \ft Or: accompanied \f* the king to Gilgal. 
\s The troops from Judah and Israel argued 
\p
\v 41 Then all the Israeli soldiers came to the king and said, “◄Why is it that our relatives, the men from Judah, took you
away from us and wanted to be the only ones to escort you and your family across the river, along with all your men?\f + \ft Or: It \f* is not
right that our relatives, the men from Judah, took you away from us and wanted to be the only ones to escort you and your
family across the river, along with all your men.► \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add Why did you not request us to do
that\add*?” \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* 
\p
\v 42 The soldiers from Judah replied, “We did it because the king is from Judah. So ◄why are you angry about this?\f + \ft Or: you \f* should
not be angry about this.► \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* The king has never paid for our food, and he has never given us any gifts.”
\p
\v 43 The men of the other Israeli tribes replied, “\add There are ten tribes in Israel, and only one in Judah.
So\add* it is ten times more right for us to say that David \add is our
king\add* than it is for you to say that. So why are you despising us \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*? We were certainly \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* the first ones to talk
about bringing David back \add to Jerusalem to be our king again\add*.”
\p But the men of Judah spoke more harshly than the men from the other tribes of Israel did.
