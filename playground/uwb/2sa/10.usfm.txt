\s David's army defeated the Ammon people-group 
\p
\v 1 Some time later, the king of the Ammon people-group died, and his son Hanun became their king.
\v 2 David thought \add to himself\add*, “Nahash was kind to me, so I will be kind to his son.” So David sent some officials
there, to tell Hanun that David was sorry that Hanun's father \add had
died\add*. 
\p When those messengers arrived in the land where the Ammon people-group lived,
\v 3 the leaders of the Ammon people-group said to Hanun, “Do you think that it is to honor your father that King David has
sent these men to say that he is sorry that you father died \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*?
\add We think that\add* he has sent them here to look around the city to determine how his
\add army\add* can conquer us!” 
\v 4 Hanun \add believed what they said\add*; so he \add commanded some soldiers
to\add* seize David's officials and \add insult them by\add* shaving off one side of each man's beard, and by cutting off the
lower part of their robes, \add with the result that their buttocks could be
seen\add*, and then they sent them away. 
\p
\v 5 The men were very humiliated/ashamed, \add so they did not want to return
home\add*. When David found out about what had happened to his officials, he sent someone to tell them, “Stay at Jericho until
your beards have grown again, and then return home.” 
\p
\v 6 Then \add the leaders of\add* the Ammon people-group realized that they had greatly insulted [IDI] David [IDI]. So they
sent some men to hire/pay some soldiers \add from other nearby areas to help defend
them\add*. They hired 20,000 soldiers from Beth-Rehob and Zobah \add regions northeast of
Israel\add*, and 12,000 soldiers from the Tob \add region\add*, and 1,000 soldiers from
\add the army of\add* the king of Maacah \add region\add*. 
\p
\v 7 When David heard about that, he sent Joab with all of the army
\add that Joab commanded\add*, to fight against them. 
\v 8 The soldiers of the Ammon people-group marched out and ◄stood in their positions/arranged themselves for battle► at the
entrance to \add their capital city, Rabbah\add*. The other soldiers from Syria and Tob and Maacah stood by themselves ◄in
their positions/arranged themselves for battle► in the nearby fields.
\p
\v 9 Joab saw that there were groups of enemy soldiers in front of his troops and behind his troops. So he chose some of the
best Israeli soldiers, and put them in positions to fight against the soldiers of Syria.
\v 10 He appointed his \add older\add* brother Abishai to be the commander of all the other soldiers, and he told them to
◄stand in their positions/arrange themselves► in front of \add the army
of\add* the Ammon people-group. 
\v 11 Then Joab said, “If the soldiers from Syria are too strong for us to defeat them, your men must come and help us. But if
the soldiers from the Ammon people-group are too strong for you to defeat, we will come and help your men.
\v 12 We must be strong, and fight hard [IDI] to \add defend\add* our people and the cities
\add ◄that belong to/where we worship►\add* our God. I will pray/request that Yahweh do what he considers to be good.”
\p
\v 13 So Joab and his army \add advanced to\add* attack the army of Syria, and the soldiers from Syria ran away from them.
\v 14 And when \add the soldiers of\add* the Ammon people-group saw that the soldiers from Syria were running away, they also
started to run away from Abishai and his army, and they retreated back inside the city. So Joab's
\add army\add* turned away from fighting against \add the army of\add* the Ammon people-group, and Joab
\add and his army\add* returned to Jerusalem. 
\p
\v 15 After \add the leaders of\add* the army of Syria saw that the Israeli army had defeated them, they gathered all their
troops together. 
\v 16  \add Their king\add*, Hadadezer, summoned the soldiers of Syria who lived on the east side of the
\add Euphrates\add* River. They gathered at Helam \add city\add*. Their commander was Shobach.
\p
\v 17 When David heard about that, he gathered all the Israeli soldiers, and they crossed the Jordan
\add River\add* and marched to Helam. There, the army of Syria ◄took their positions/arranged themselves for battle►, and the
battle started. 
\v 18 But the soldiers of Syria ran away from the Israeli soldiers. David
\add and his army\add* killed 700 of their chariot-drivers and 40,000 other soldiers. They also wounded Shobach, their
commander, and he died there. 
\v 19 When all the kings who had been ruled by Hadadezer realized that they had been defeated by the Israeli
\add army\add*, they made peace with the Israelis and agreed to accept David to be their king. So
\add the army of\add* Syria was afraid to help \add the army of\add* the Ammon people-group anymore.
