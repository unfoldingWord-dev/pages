\c 17  
\p
\v 1 Then Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Allow me to choose 12,000 men, and I will leave
\add with them\add* tonight to pursue David. 
\v 2 We will attack him while he is tired and discouraged, and cause him to be very frightened. All the soldiers who are with
him will run away. We will kill only the king. 
\v 3 Then we will bring back all his soldiers to you, like \f + \fr simile \f* a ◄bride/woman comes to her husband when she is married►. You
are wanting to kill only one man; so the other people will not be harmed.”
\v 4 Absalom and all the Israeli leaders \add who were with him\add* thought that what Ahithophel said would be good to do.
\p
\v 5 But Absalom said, “Summon Hushai also, and we will hear what he suggests.”
\v 6 So when Hushai arrived, Absalom \add told him\add* what Ahithophel had suggested. Then he asked Hushai, “What do you think
we should do? If you do not think that we should do what Ahithophel suggests, tell us
\add what you think that we should do\add*.” 
\p
\v 7 Hushai replied, “This time what Ahithophel has suggested is not good advice.
\v 8 You know that your father and the men who are with him are strong soldiers, and that now they are very angry, like \f + \fr simile \f* a
mother bear whose cubs have been stolen from her. Furthermore, your father knows how to fight because he has fought in many
battles. He will not stay with his troops during the night. 
\v 9 Right now he is probably already hiding in one of the pits, or in some other place.
\add If his soldiers start to attack your soldiers, and\add* if they kill some of them, whoever hears about that will say ‘Many
of the soldiers with Absalom have been killed!’ 
\v 10 Then your other soldiers, even if they are as fearless [SIM, IDI] as lions, they will become very afraid. Do not forget
that everyone in Israel knows that your father is a great/strong soldier, and that the soldiers who are with him are also very
brave/courageous. 
\p
\v 11 So what I suggest is that you summon all the Israeli soldiers, from Dan
\add in the far north\add* to Beersheba \add in the far south\add*. They will be as many as the grains of sand on the seashore
\f + \fr hyperbole \f*. And then you yourself lead us into the battle. 
\v 12 We will find \add your father\add*, wherever he is, and we will attack him
\add from all sides\add*, like \f + \fr simile \f* dew covers all the ground. And neither he nor any of the soldiers who are with him will
survive. 
\v 13 If he escapes into some city, all our soldiers will bring ropes and pull that city down into the valley. As a result, not
one stone will be left there \add on top of the hill where that city
was\add*!” 
\p
\v 14 Absalom and all the other Israeli men \add who were with him\add* said, “What Hushai suggests is better than what
Ahithophel suggested.” The reason that happened was that Yahweh had determined that if they would accept the good advice that
Ahithophel had given them, \add they would have been able to defeat/kill
David\add*. But \add as a result of their doing what Hushai suggested\add*, Yahweh would cause a disaster to happen to Absalom.
\s Hushai arranged for a report to be sent to David 
\p
\v 15 Then Hushai told the two priests, Zadok and Abiathar, what both he and Ahithophel had suggested to Absalom and the
Israeli leaders. 
\v 16 Then he said to them, “Send \add a message\add* quickly to David. Tell him to not stay at the place where people walk
across the river, near the desert. Instead, he and his soldiers must cross the
\add Jordan River\add* immediately, in order that they will not be killed/wiped out.”
\p
\v 17  \add The priest's two sons\add*, Jonathan and Ahimaaz, were waiting at En-Rogel
\add spring\add*, outside Jerusalem. They did not \add dare to\add* enter the city, because if someone saw them,
\add he would report it to Absalom\add*. \add While they were at
En-Rogel\add*, a female servant \add of the two priests\add* would frequently go to them and report to them
\add what was happening\add*, and then they would go and report it to King David.
\v 18 But a young man saw them, and went and reported it to Absalom. They
\add found out what the young man had done\add*, so both of them left quickly and went to stay in the house of a man in
Bahurim. That man had a well in his courtyard; so the two men went down into the well
\add to hide\add*. 
\v 19 The man's wife took a cloth/mat and covered the well, and scattered grain on top of it order than no one would know
\add that two men were hiding inside it\add*. 
\p
\v 20 Some of Absalom's soldiers \add found out where the two men had
gone\add*. So they went to the house, and asked the woman, “Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?”
\p She replied, “They crossed the river.” 
\p So the soldiers \add crossed the river and\add* searched for them. But after they could not find them, they returned to
Jerusalem. 
\v 21 After they had gone, the two men came out of the well and went and reported to King David
\add what had happened\add* and what Ahithophel had suggested. Then they said to him, “Cross the river quickly!”
\v 22 So David and all his soldiers quickly started to cross the Jordan
\add River\add*, and by dawn they had all crossed to the other side.
\p
\v 23 When Ahithophel realized that Absalom was not going to do what he suggested, he put a saddle on his donkey and returned
to his own town. He gave \add to his family\add* instructions about his possessions, and then he hanged himself
\add because he knew that Absalom would be defeated and that he would be considered a traitor and be
killed\add*. His body was buried in the tomb where his ancestors
\add had been buried\add*. 
\p
\v 24 David \add and his soldiers\add* arrived at Mahanaim. And Absalom
\add and all his Israeli soldiers\add* also crossed the Jordan \add River\add*.
\v 25 Absalom had appointed \add his cousin\add* Amasa to be the commander of his army, instead of Joab. Amasa was the son of a
man named Jether, a descendant of Ishmael. Amasa's mother was Abigail, the daughter of Nahash and the sister of Joab's mother
Zeruiah. 
\v 26 Absalom and his Israeli soldiers set up their tents in the Gilead
\add region\add*. 
\p
\v 27 When David \add and his soldiers\add* arrived at Mahanaim, Shobi the son of Nahash from Rabbah
\add city\add* in the Ammon area, and Machir the son of Ammiel from Lo-Debar
\add city\add*, and Barzillai from Rogelim \add town\add* in the Gilead
\add region\add* 
\v 28 brought sleeping mats, bowls, clay pots, barley, wheat flour, parched grain, beans, and lentils, came to them.
\v 29 They brought honey and curds, sheep, and some cream/cheese for David and his soldiers to eat. They knew that David and
his soldiers would be hungry and tired and thirsty \add from marching\add* in the desert.
