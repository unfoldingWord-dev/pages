\c 24  
\s David ordered a census to be taken 
\p
\v 1 Yahweh was angry with the Israeli people again, so he incited David to cause trouble for them. He said to David, “Send
\add some men\add* to count the people of Israel and Judah.” 
\p
\v 2 So the king said to Joab, the commander of his army, “Go \add with your
officers\add* through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan \add city in the far
north\add* to Beersheba \add town in the far south\add*, and count the people, in order that I may know how many people
\add there are who are able to be soldiers in the army\add*.” 
\p
\v 3 But Joab replied to the king, “Your Majesty, I wish/desire that Yahweh our God may cause there to be a hundred times as
many people \add in Israel\add* as there are now, and I wish/desire that you would see that happen
\add before you die\add*. But why do you want us to do this?” 
\p
\v 4 But the king commanded Joab and his officers to do it. So they left the king and went out to count the people of Israel.
\p
\v 5 They crossed the Jordan \add River\add* and set up their tents south of Aroer
\add town\add*, in the middle of the valley, in the territory \add that was given to the
tribe\add* of Gad. From there they went \add north\add* to Jazer
\add city\add* 
\v 6 Then they went \add north\add* to the Gilead \add region\add* and to Kadesh
\add city\add*, in the land where the Heth people-group lived. Then they went to Dan
\add city in the far north of Israel\add*, and then further west, to Sidon
\add city near the Mediterranean Sea\add*. 
\v 7 Then they went \add south\add* to Tyre, a city with high walls around it, and to all the cities where the Hiv and Canaan
people-groups lived. Then they went \add east\add* to Beersheba, in the southern part of Judah.
\p
\v 8 After nine months and twenty days, when they had finished going throughout the land
\add and counting the people\add*, they returned to Jerusalem. 
\p
\v 9 They reported to the king the number of people that they had counted. There were 800,000 men in Israel and 500,00 men in
Judah who were able to become soldiers in the army \f + \fk metonymy \f*. 
\p
\v 10 But after David's men had counted the people, David regretted [IDI] that he had told them to do that.
\add One night\add* he said to Yahweh, “I have committed a very big sin. Please forgive me, because what I have done is very
foolish.” 
\p
\v 11 When David got up the next morning, Yahweh gave a message to the prophet Gad. He said to him,
\v 12 “Go and tell this to David: ‘I am allowing you to choose one of three things
\add to punish you\add*. I will do whichever one you choose.’ ” 
\p
\v 13 So Gad went to David and told him \add what Yahweh had said\add*. He said to David, “You can choose whether there will be
three years of famine in your land, or three months of \add your
army\add* running away from your enemies, or three days when there will be a ◄plague/very severe illness► in your land. You
think about it and choose \add which one you want\add*, and \add tell
me\add*, and I will return to Yahweh and tell him what your answer is.”
\p
\v 14 David said to Gad, “All those are very terrible things for me to choose between! But allow Yahweh to punish \f + \fk metonymy \f* me,
because he is very merciful. Do not allow humans to punish me, \add because they will not be
merciful\add*.” 
\p
\v 15 So Yahweh sent a plague on the Israeli people. It started that morning and did not stop until the time that he had
chosen/set. All over the land, from Dan to Beersheba, there were 70,000 Israelis who died
\add because of the plague\add*. 
\v 16 When \add Yahweh's\add* angel stretched out his hand toward Jerusalem to destroy
\add the people by this plague\add*, Yahweh changed his mind about punishing
\add any more\add* people. He said to the angel who was killing them
\add with the plague\add*, “Stop what you are doing [IDI]!That is enough!”
\add When he said that\add*, the angel was standing at the ground where Araunah, from the Jebus people-group, threshed grain.
\p
\v 17 When David saw the angel who was causing the people to become sick and die, he said to Yahweh, “Truly, I am the one who
has committed the sin. I have done a very wicked thing, but these people are
\add as innocent as\add* sheep \f + \fk metaphor \f*. They have certainly not \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* done anything
\add that is wrong\add*. So you should punish [IDI] me and my family,
\add not these people\add*!” 
\p
\v 18 That day Gad came to David and said to him, “Go up to the place where Araunah threshes grain, and build an altar to
\add worship\add* Yahweh there.” 
\v 19 So David did what Gad told him to do, which was what Yahweh had commanded,
\add and he went up there\add*. 
\v 20 When Araunah looked down and saw the king and his officials coming toward him, he prostrated himself on the ground in
front of the king, with his face touching the ground. 
\p
\v 21 Araunah said, “Your Majesty, why have you come to me?” David replied,
“\add I have come\add* to buy this ground where you thresh grain, in order to build an altar to Yahweh
\add and offer sacrifices on it\add*, in order that he will stop the plague.”
\p
\v 22 Araunah replied to David, “Your Majesty, offer to Yahweh whatever you wish/want. Here, take my oxen to use for the
offering that will be completely burned on the altar. And here, take their yokes and the boards
\add that I use\add* for the threshing, and \add use them\add* for the wood that you will burn.
\v 23 I, Araunah, am giving all this to you, the king.” Then he said, “I desire/hope that Yahweh our God will accept your
offering.” 
\p
\v 24 But the king said to Araunah, “No, I will \add not take these things as a
gift\add*. I will pay you for it. I will not offer sacrifices that have cost me nothing, and offer them to Yahweh to be
completely burned on the altar.” So he paid fifty pieces of silver to Araunah for the oxen and the ground.
\p
\v 25 Then David built an altar to Yahweh, and he offered \add the
oxen\add* to be completely burned on the altar, and he also offered sacrifices to restore fellowship with Yahweh. Then, Yahweh
answered David's prayers, and he caused the plague in Israel to end.
