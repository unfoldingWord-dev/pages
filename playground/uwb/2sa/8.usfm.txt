\add the upper part of\add* the Euphrates River. 
\v 4 David's army captured 1,700 of Hadadezer's soldiers who rode on horses, and 20,000 of his other soldiers. They also

\add army\add*, David's soldiers killed 22,000 of them. 
\v 6 Then David stationed ◄groups of his soldiers/army camps► in their area, and the people of Syria were forced to accept

year\add* the payment/tax that he demanded. And Yahweh enabled David's
\add army\add* to win victories wherever they went.

\v 9 When Toi, the king of the Hamath \add city in Syria\add*, heard that David's

Hadadezer's army, which Tou's \add army\add* had fought many times. Joram brought to David many items/gifts made from gold,
silver, and bronze.

\v 11 King David dedicated all those items to Yahweh. He also dedicated the silver and gold which his army had taken from the
nations that they had conquered. 
\v 12 They had taken items from the Edom people-group and the Moab people-group, from the Ammon people-group, from the
Philistia people, from \add the descendants of Amalek\add*, as well as from the people that Hadadezer
\add previously\add* ruled.

soldiers from the Edom people-group in the Salt Valley \add near the Dead
Sea\add*. 
\p
