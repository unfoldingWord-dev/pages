\c 11  
\s David sinned with Bathsheba 
\p
\v 1  \add In that region\add*, kings usually went \add with their
armies\add* to fight \add their enemies\add* in the springtime. But the following year, in the springtime,
\add David did not do that. Instead\add*, he stayed in Jerusalem, and he sent
\add his commander\add* Joab \add to lead the army\add*. So Joab went with the other officers and the rest of the Israeli army.
\add They crossed the Jordan River and\add* defeated the army of the Ammon people-group. Then they surrounded
\add the capital city\add*, Rabbah. 
\p
\v 2 Late one afternoon, after David got up from taking a nap, he walked around the
\add flat\add* roof of his palace. He saw a woman who was bathing in
\add the courtyard of her house\add*. The woman was very beautiful.
\v 3 David sent a messenger to find out who she was. \add The messenger
returned\add* and said, “She is \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* Bathsheba. She is the daughter of Eliam, and her husband is Uriah, from the Heth
people-group.” 
\p
\v 4 Then David sent more messengers to get her. They brought her to David, and he ◄slept/had sex► \f + \fr euphemism \f* with her. [She had
just finished performing the rituals to make herself pure \add after her monthly menstrual
period\add*.] Then Bathsheba went back home. 
\v 5  \add After some time\add*, she realized that she was pregnant. So she sent a messenger to tell David
\add that she was pregnant\add*. 
\p
\v 6 Then David sent a message to Joab. He said, “Send Uriah, from the Heth people-group, to me.” So Joab did that. He sent
Uriah to David. 
\v 7 When he arrived, David asked if Joab was well, and if other soldiers were well, and how the war was progressing.
\v 8 Then David, \add hoping that Uriah would go home and sleep with his
wife\add*, said to Uriah, “Okay, go home and relax for a while. [IDI]” So Uriah left, and David gave someone a gift
\add of some food\add* to take to Uriah's house. 
\v 9 But Uriah did not go home. Instead, he slept at the palace entrance with the king's palace guards.
\p
\v 10 When someone told David that Uriah did not go to his house
\add that night\add*, David \add summoned him again and\add* said to him, “Why didn't you go home
\add to be with your wife last night\add*, after having been away for a long time?” \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*
\p
\v 11 Uriah replied, “The soldiers of Judah and Israel are camping in the open fields, and even our commander Joab is sleeping
in a tent, and the sacred box is with them. ◄How could I/It would not be right for me to► go home, eat and drink, and sleep
with my wife \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*. I solemnly declare [IDI] that I will never do such a thing!”
\p
\v 12 Then David said to Uriah, “Stay here today. I will let you return
\add to the battle\add* tomorrow.” So Uriah stayed in Jerusalem that day and that night.
\v 13 The next day, David invited him \add to a meal\add*. So Uriah had a meal with David, and David made him drink a lot of
wine so that he would get drunk, \add hoping that if he was drunk, he would sleep with his
wife\add*. But that night, Uriah again did not go home. Instead, he slept on his cot with the king's servants.
\p
\v 14  \add Someone reported that to David\add*, so the next morning he wrote a letter to Joab, and gave it to Uriah to take to
Joab. 
\v 15 In the letter, he wrote, “Put Uriah in the front line, where the fighting is the ◄worst/most severe►. Then command the
soldiers to pull back from him, in order that he will be killed \add by our
enemies\add*.” 
\p
\v 16  \add So after Joab got the letter\add*, as his army was surrounding the city, he sent Uriah to a place where he knew
that their enemies' strongest and best soldiers would be fighting.
\v 17 The men from the city came out and fought with Joab's soldiers. They killed some of David's officers, including Uriah.
\p
\v 18 Then Joab sent a messenger to David to tell him about the fighting.
\v 19 He said to the messenger, “Tell David the news about the battle. After you finish telling that to him,
\v 20 if David is angry \add because so many officers were killed\add*, he may ask you, ‘Why did your soldiers go so close to
the city to fight \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*? Did you not know that they would shoot \add arrows at you while they were standing on
top\add* of the city wall \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*? 
\v 21 Do you not remember how Abimelech, the son of Gideon, was killed? A woman
\add who lived\add* in Thebez threw a huge ◄millstone/stone for grinding grain► on him from
\add the top of a tower\add*, and he died. So why did our troops go near to the city wall?’ If the king asks this, then tell
him, ‘Your officer Uriah also was killed.’ ” 
\p
\v 22 So the messenger went and told David everything that Joab told him to say.
\v 23 The messenger said to David, “Our enemies were very brave, and came out of the city to fight us in the fields.
\add They were defeating us\add* but we forced them back to the city gate.
\v 24 Then their archers shot arrows at us from \add the top of\add* the city wall. They killed some of your officers. They
killed your officer Uriah, too.” 
\p
\v 25 David said to the messenger, “Go back to Joab and say to him, ‘Do not be distressed
\add about what happened\add*, because no one ever knows who will be killed in a battle.’ Tell him that the next time, his
troops should attack the city more strongly, and capture it.” 
\p
\v 26 When Uriah's wife \add Bathsheba\add* heard that her husband had died, she mourned for him.
\v 27 When her time of mourning was ended, David sent messengers to bring her to the palace. Thus, she became David's wife. She
later gave birth to a son. But Yahweh was very displeased with what David had done.
