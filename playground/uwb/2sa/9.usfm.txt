\c 9  
\s David acted kindly toward Mephibosheth 
\p
\v 1 One day David asked, “Is there anyone who is a descendant of Saul to whom I can act kindly?” He asked this because he
wanted to honor Jonathan. 
\p
\v 2  \add They told him that\add* there was \add in Jerusalem\add* a man named Ziba who had been a servant of Saul's family.
So \add David sent messengers to summon Ziba. When he arrived\add*, the king asked him, “Are you Ziba?” He replied, “Yes, your
majesty, I am.” 
\p
\v 3 The king asked him, “Is there anyone in Saul's family to whom I can act kindly,
\add as I promised God that I would do\add*?” Ziba replied, “Yes, there is one son of Jonathan who is still
\add alive\add*. His feet are crippled.” 
\p
\v 4 The king asked him, “Where is he?” Ziba replied, “He is \add living\add* in the house of Machir, son of Ammiel, in
Lo-Debar \add city east of the Jordan River\add*.” 
\p
\v 5 So King David sent \add messengers\add* to bring \add Mephibosheth to
Jerusalem\add*. 
\p
\v 6 When Mephibosheth came to David, he knelt down with his face on the ground, to show respect. Then David said,
“Mephibosheth!” He replied, “Yes, your majesty, how may I serve you?”
\p
\v 7 David said to him, “Do not be afraid; I will be kind to you because Jonathan your father
\add was my friend was\add*. I will give back to you all the land that belonged to your grandfather Saul. And
\add I want\add* you to always eat with me at my house \f + \fr metonymy \f*.” 
\p
\v 8 Mephibosheth bowed \add in front of David again\add* and said, “Sir, I am
\add as worthless as\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f* a dead dog; I do not deserve \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* that you act kindly toward me!”
\p
\v 9 Then the king summoned Saul's servant Ziba and said to him, “Saul was your master; now I am giving to Mephibosheth
everything that belonged to Saul and his family. 
\v 10 You and your fifteen sons and your twenty servants must till/plow the land for Mephibosheth's
\add family\add*, and \add plant crops\add* and harvest them, in order that they will have food to eat. But Mephibosheth will
eat food with me at my house.” 
\p
\v 11 Ziba replied to the king, “Your majesty, I will do everything that you have commanded me to do.” So
\add after that\add*, Mephibosheth always ate at the king's table, as though he were one of the king's sons.
\p
\v 12 Mephibosheth had a young son named Mica. All of Ziba's family became servants of Mephibosheth.
\v 13 And Mephibosheth, who was still crippled in both of his feet, started to live in Jerusalem, and he always ate ◄at the
king's table/with the king►.
