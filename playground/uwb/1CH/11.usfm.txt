\s David became the king 
\p
\v 1 Then the people of Israel came to David at Hebron \add town\add* and said to him, “Listen, we have the same ancestors
[IDI] that you have. 
\v 2 In the past, when Saul was our king, it was you who led our Israeli
\add soldiers in our battles\add*. You are the one to whom our God promised, ‘You will be the leader [MET] of my people; you
will be their king.’ ” 
\p
\v 3 So all the Israeli elders came to David at Hebron. And David made a sacred agreement with them while Yahweh was listening.
They anointed him \add with olive oil to set him apart\add* to be the king of the Israeli people. That is what Yahweh had
previously told \add the prophet\add* Samuel would happen. 
\s David's men captured Jerusalem 
\p
\v 4 David and all the Israeli soldiers went to Jerusalem. \add At that
time\add*, Jerusalem was called Jebus, and the people who lived there were the Jebus people-group.
\v 5 They said to David, “Your soldiers will not be able to get inside our city!” But David's
\add soldiers\add* captured the city, even though it had strong walls around it, and since then it has been called the City of
David. 
\p
\v 6  \add What happened was this\add*: David said to his soldiers, “The one who leads our soldiers to attack the Jebus
people-group will become the commander of all my army.” Joab, the son of Zeruiah, led the soldiers, so he became the commander
of all the army. 
\p
\v 7  \add After they captured\add* the city with its strong walls around it, David moved there. That is why they named it the
City of David. 
\v 8 David's workers rebuilt the city, starting where the land was filled in, and extending to the wall that was around the
city. Joab's \add men\add* repaired the other parts of the city.
\v 9 David became more and more powerful/influential, because the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels was with/helping
him. 
\s The list of David's mighty warriors 
\p
\v 10 Yahweh had promised \add that David would become the king\add*. And all the Israeli people ◄were happy that David
was/supported David as► their king. 
\p There were many soldiers/warriors who helped David's kingdom to remain strong.
\v 11 This is a list of David's \add most outstanding\add* warriors:
\p Jashobeam was from the Hacmon clan. He was the leader of David's three most powerful soldiers. One time he fought against
three hundred enemies and killed them all with his spear. 
\v 12 Next was Eleazar, who was the son of Dodo from the clan of Ahoh.
\v 13  \add One day\add* he was with David at Pas Dammim when the soldiers of Philistia gathered there for the battle. There
was a field of barley there. At first the Israeli soldiers ran away from the soldiers of Philistia,
\v 14 but then David and Eleazar stopped in the middle of the field and fought to defend it and killed
\add many of\add* the soldiers of Philistia. Yahweh enabled them to win a great victory on that day.
\p
\v 15 One time three of David's thirty greatest soldiers came to David when he was camping next to the huge rock outside the
cave near Adullam. At that same time, the army of Philistia had camped in the Rephaim Valley.
\v 16 David was in a fortress, and some of the soldiers of Philistia were occupying Bethlehem.
\v 17  \add One day\add* David very much wanted \add some water\add* to drink, and said “I wish that someone would bring me
some water from the well near the gate at Bethlehem!” 
\v 18 So the three greatest warriors forced through the camp of Philistia soldiers and drew some water from the well, and
brought it to David. But he would not drink it. Instead, he poured it out
\add on the ground to be an offering\add* to Yahweh. 
\v 19 He said, “Yahweh, it would certainly not be right for me to drink this water! That would be like [RHQ] drinking the blood
of these men who were willing/ready to die for me!” So he refused to drink it.
\p That was one of the things that David's three greatest warriors did.
\p
\v 20 Joab's \add younger\add* brother Abishai was the leader of the thirty greatest warriors.
\add One time\add* Abishai fought three hundred \add enemy\add* soldiers with his spear and killed them.
\v 21 So he became as famous as the three greatest warriors. He became their commander, even though he was not one of those
three men. 
\p
\v 22 Jehoiada's son Benaiah was a brave soldier from Kabzeel \add town\add* who did great deeds. He killed two of the best
warriors from the Moab \add people-group\add*. One day he went down into a pit when snow was falling
\add on the ground\add*, and killed a lion there. 
\v 23 He also killed a soldier from Egypt who was ◄7-1/2 ft./2.3 meters► tall. The soldier from Egypt carried a spear that was
as long as a weaver's rod. Benaiah had \add only\add* a club, but he grabbed the other man's spear and killed him with it.
\v 24 Those are some of the things that Benaiah did. So he became as famous as the three greatest warriors.
\v 25 He was more honored that the other members of the group of thirty great warriors, but he did not become a member of the
group of three most outstanding warriors. David appointed him to be the leader of his bodyguards.
