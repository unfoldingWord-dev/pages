\c 9  
\s Abimelech became king in Shechem 
\p
\v 1 Gideon's son Abimelech went to \add talk with\add* his mother's brothers in Shechem
\add city\add*. He said to them and to all his mother's relatives,
\v 2 “Ask all the leaders of your city: ‘Do you \add think it would
be\add* good for all seventy of Gideon's sons to rule over you? Or would it be better to have only one man,
\add Abimelech\add*, to rule over you?’ And do not forget that I am your relative! \f + \ft metonymy \f*”
\p
\v 3 So Abimelech's mother's brothers spoke to all the leaders of Shechem about what Abimelech had said. They said to each
other, “We should allow Abimelech to rule over us, because he is our relative.”
\v 4 So the leaders of Shechem took from the temple of \add their
god\add* Baal-Berith almost 2 pounds\f + \ft Or: 0.8 kg. \f* of silver and gave it to Abimelech. With that silver he paid some worthless
troublemakers to help him, and they went with Abimelech wherever he went.
\v 5 They went to Ophrah, his father's town, and murdered 69 of his 70 brothers, the sons of his farther Gideon. They killed
all those men on one huge rock. But Gideon's youngest son Jotham hid
\add from Abimelech and his men\add*, and he escaped. 
\v 6 Then all the leaders of Shechem and Beth-Millo gathered under the big sacred tree in Shechem. There they appointed
Abimelech to be their leader. 
\p
\v 7 When Jotham heard about that, he climbed up Gerizim Mountain. He stood at the top of the mountain and shouted to the
people \add down below\add*, “You leaders of Shechem, listen to me, in order that God will listen to you!
\v 8 One day the trees decided to appoint a king to rule over all of them. So they said to the olive tree, ‘You be our king!’
\p
\v 9 But the olive tree said, ‘No! \add I will not be your king\add*! Men and gods enjoy the oil from my fruit. I will not
\f + \ft rhetorical question \f* stop producing \add olives from which we make\add* that oil, in order to rule over you other trees!’
\p
\v 10 Then the trees said to the fig tree, ‘You come and be our king!’
\p
\v 11 But the fig tree replied, ‘No! I do not want to \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* stop producing my good sweet fruit, and go and rule over you other
trees!’ 
\p
\v 12 Then the trees said to the grapevine, ‘Come and be our king!’
\p
\v 13 But the grapevine replied, ‘No! \add I will not be your king\add*! The new wine
\add that is made from my grapes\add* causes people and gods \add who drink
it\add* to become very happy. I do not want to stop producing grapes and go and rule over you other trees!’ \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\p
\v 14 Then all the trees said to the thornbush, ‘Come and be our king!’
\p
\v 15 The thornbush replied, ‘If you truly want to appoint me to be your king, come into the shade of my
\add tiny branches\add*. But if you do not want to do that, I hope\f + \ft Or: desire \f* that fire will come out from me and burn up all the
huge cedar trees in Lebanon \add country\add*!’ ” 
\p
\v 16  \add After Jotham finished telling them this parable, he said\add*, “So now
\add I ask you\add*, were you being completely honest and sincere when you appointed Abimelech to be your king \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*? And have
you acted fairly toward Gideon and his family \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*? Have you rewarded Gideon by honoring him as he deserved
\add because of all the good things he did for you\add*? No! 
\v 17  \add Do not forget that\add* my father fought a battle for you, and he was willing to die for you
\add if that were necessary\add*, to save you from the power of the Midian people-group.
\v 18 But now you have rebelled against my father's family, and you have killed 69 of his sons on one huge rock. And you have
appointed Abimelech—who is the son of my father's slave girl, \add not the son of his
wife\add*—to be the king who will rule you people of Shechem. You have done that only because he is one of your relatives!
\v 19 So, if today you think that you have truly acted fairly and sincerely toward Gideon and his family, I hope\f + \ft Or: desire \f* that he
will cause you to be happy and that you will cause him to be happy.
\v 20 But if what you did was not right, I wish\f + \ft Or: desire \f* that Abimelech will burn up all of you leaders of Shechem and Beth-Millo
with fire! And I also hope\f + \ft Or: desire \f* that the leaders of Shechem and Beth-Millo will cause fire to burn up Abimelech!”
\p
\v 21 After Jotham \add finished saying that\add*, he escaped from them and ran away to Beer
\add town\add*. He stayed there because he was afraid that his brother Abimelech
\add would try to kill him\add*. 
\s Abimelech and his men killed the people of Shechem 
\p
\v 22 Abimelech \add became the leader of all the people of Israel\add*. He ruled them for three years.
\v 23 Then God sent an evil spirit \add to cause trouble\add* between Abimelech and the leaders of Shechem, with the result
that the leaders of Shechem rebelled against Abimelech. 
\v 24 The leaders of Shechem had previously helped Abimelech to kill 69 of Gideon's sons, who were his brothers. So now God
sent the evil spirit to punish all of them. 
\v 25 The leaders of Shechem set an ambush\f + \ft Or: sent men to hide \f* on the hilltops. Those men robbed everyone who passed by. But
someone told Abimelech about it, \add so he did not go near them\add*.
\p
\v 26 There was a man named Gaal, the son of Ebed, who moved into Shechem
\add city\add*, along with his brothers. Soon the leaders of Shechem started to trust him.
\v 27 They went out \add of the city\add* to their vineyards and picked some grapes. They pressed the grapes
\add to make juice, and then they made wine\add*. Then they had a feast in the temple of their god, and they ate
\add a lot of food\add* and drank \add a lot of wine\add*. Then they cursed Abimelech.
\v 28 Gaal said, “Why should \add we allow\add* Abimelech to rule over us?\f + \ft Or: We should not allow Abimelech to rule over us! \f*
\f + \ft rhetorical question \f* He is only one of Gideon's sons, \add so he really does not belong to
us\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*! And he appointed Zebul, the governor of our city, to be his deputy! We should serve\f + \ft Or: be loyal to \f*
\add one of the descendants of\add* Hamor, \add the founder of our
city\add*, to be our leader, not Abimelech \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*! 
\v 29 If you would appoint me to be your leader, I would get rid of Abimelech. I would say to him, ‘Get your army ready,
\add and then come to fight us\add*!’ ” 
\p
\v 30 When someone told Zebul what Gaal said, he was very angry.
\v 31 He secretly sent some messengers to Abimelech. They told him, “Gaal and his brothers have come here to Shechem, and they
are causing \add the people of\add* the city to rebel against you.
\v 32 You and your men should get up during the night and go and hide in the fields outside the city.
\v 33 As soon as the sun rises in the morning, get up and attack the city. When Gaal and his men come out to fight against you,
you can do to them whatever you want to.” 
\p
\v 34 So Abimelech and all the men who were with him got up during the night. They
\add divided into\add* four groups, and hid \add in the fields\add* near Shechem.
\v 35  \add The next morning\add*, Gaal went out and stood at the entrance to the city gate. While he was standing there,
Abimelech and his soldiers came out of their hiding places \add and started walking toward the
city\add*. 
\p
\v 36 When Gaal saw the soldiers, he said to Zebul, “Look! There are people coming down from the hills!”
\p But Zebul said, “You are seeing only the shadows \add of trees\add* on the hills. They
\add are not people\add*; they only resemble people.” 
\v 37 But Gaal \add looked\add* again, and said, “Look! There are people coming down from the top of the sacred mountain! There
is a group of them coming down from where the tree is where people talk with the spirits of dead people!”
\p
\v 38 Zebul said to Gaal, “Now what good is your bragging?\f + \ft Or: your bragging is worthless! \f* \f + \ft metonymy, rhetorical question \f* You said, ‘Why should we
serve Abimelech\f + \ft Or: We should not allow Abimelech to rule over us \f*?’ You made fun of these men. So now go out and fight them!”
\p
\v 39 So Gaal led the men of Shechem outside \add the city\add* to fight Abimelech
\add and his men\add*. 
\v 40 Abimelech and his men pursued them, and they killed many of Gaal's men before they could return
\add safely\add* inside the city gate. 
\v 41 Abimelech then stayed at Arumah, \add about five miles away from
Shechem\add*, and Zebul's men forced Gaal and his brothers to leave Shechem.
\p
\v 42 The next day, the people of Shechem \add got ready to\add* leave
\add the city and work in\add* their fields. When someone told Abimelech about that,
\v 43 he divided his men into three groups, and told them to hide in the fields. So they did that. And when they saw the people
coming out of the city, they jumped up and attacked them. 
\v 44 Abimelech and the men who were with him ran to the city gate. The other two groups ran out to the people in the fields
and attacked them. 
\v 45 Abimelech and his men fought all day. They captured the city and killed all the people. They tore down all the buildings,
and then they threw salt over the ruins \add to symbolize that they wanted nothing to grow there
again\add*. 
\s They killed the people in the fortress 
\p
\v 46 When the leaders who lived in the tower\f + \ft Or: fortress \f* outside of Shechem heard what had happened, they ran and hid inside the
\add fortress, which was also a\add* temple of \add their god\add* El-Berith.
\v 47 But someone told Abimelech that all the leaders had gathered there.
\v 48 So he and all the men who were with him went up Zalmon Mountain,
\add which is near Shechem\add*. Abimelech cut some branches of trees with an axe, and put them on his shoulders. Then he said
to all the men who were with him, “Quickly, do what I have just done!”
\v 49 So his men all cut branches \add carried them down the mountain\add*, following Abimelech. They went to the fortress and
piled the branches against its walls. Then they kindled a fire, and the fire burned down the fortress and killed all the people
who were inside. So all the people who were inside the fortress—about a thousand men and women—died.
\s Abimelech was killed 
\p
\v 50 Then Abimelech and his men went to Thebes \add city\add*. They surrounded it and captured it.
\v 51 But there was a strong tower inside the city. So all the men, women, and leaders of the city ran to the tower. When they
were all inside, they locked the door. Then they climbed up to the roof of the tower.
\v 52 Abimelech and his men came to the tower and tried to get in the door,
\add but they could not\add*. Then Abimelech prepared to light a fire to burn down the door.
\v 53 But when Abimelech came near the doorway, a woman \add who was on the
roof\add* dropped a big grinding stone on his head, and crushed his skull.
\p
\v 54 Abimelech quickly called to the young man who carried Abimelech's weapons, and said, “Pull out your sword and kill me
with it! I do not want people to say ‘It was a woman who killed Abimelech.’ ” So the young man thrust his sword into Abimelech,
and Abimelech died. 
\v 55 When the Israeli soldiers saw that Abimelech was dead, they all returned to their homes.
\p
\v 56 In that way God punished Abimelech for all the evil things that he had done to his father by killing all 69 of his
brothers. 
\v 57 God also punished the men of Shechem for the evil things that they had done. And when these things happened, it fulfilled
what Jotham said when he cursed \add Abimelech and the leaders of
Shechem\add*.
