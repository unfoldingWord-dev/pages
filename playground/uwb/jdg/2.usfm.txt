\c 2  
\s Yahweh's message to Israel 
\p
\v 1 Yahweh \add appeared in the form of\add* an angel and went up from Gilgal to
\add a place they later called\add* Bokim. He said \add to the Israeli
people\add*, “I brought \add your ancestors\add* up here from Egypt. I led them into this land that I solemnly promised to give
to your ancestors. I said to them, ‘The agreement that I made with you, as for me, I will never ◄break it/say that it is
ended►. 
\v 2 But as for you, you must never make a peace agreement with the people who live in this land. You must tear down the altars
\add where they make sacrifices to idols\add*.’ But you have not obeyed me.
\v 3 So now, I am telling you that I will not expel \add your enemies\add* as you advance. They will be like thorns in your
sides. And they will try to trap you \add by making you worship\add* their idols.”
\p
\v 4 After he told that to all the Israelis, the people cried loudly.
\v 5 They called that place Bokim, \add which means 'weeping\add*.' There they offered sacrifices to Yahweh.
\s Joshua died 
\p
\v 6 After Joshua sent the Israel people away, each group went to possess the land that had been allotted to them.
\v 7 They served Yahweh as long as Joshua was alive, and as long as the elders, those who had seen all the great things that
Yahweh had done for Israel, were alive. 
\p
\v 8 Then Yahweh's servant Joshua died. He was 100 years old when he died.
\v 9 They buried his body in the area he had received \add from Moses\add*, at Timnath-Serah, in the area where the descendants
of Ephraim lived, north of Gaash Mountain. 
\s The Israelis were punished for doing evil things 
\p
\v 10 After all the people who lived at the same time as Joshua died \f + \fk euphemism \f*, a group of people grew up who did not know Yahweh,
and did not know what great things he had done for the Israeli people.
\v 11-13 They did things that Yahweh said were very evil. They worshiped
\add idols that represented the god\add* Baal and the goddess Astarte. They worshiped \f + \fk doublet \f* the various gods that the
people-groups around them worshiped. They stopped worshiping Yahweh, the God their ancestors worshiped, the one who had brought
their ancestors out of Egypt. This caused Yahweh to be very angry.
\v 14 So he allowed people from other groups to raid them and steal their crops and animals. They were no longer able to resist
their enemies, and Yahweh allowed all their enemies around them to defeat them.
\v 15 Whenever the Israeli went to fight \add their enemies\add*, Yahweh \f + \fk metonymy \f* was opposing them, and allowed their enemies to
defeat them, just as he had promised he would do. So the Israelis were greatly distressed.
\p
\v 16 Then Yahweh brought leaders to them. These leaders rescued the Israelis from the people who were raiding them.
\v 17 But the Israelis still would not heed their leaders. Instead, they
\add gave themselves\add* to the idols, \add acting like\add* prostitutes who
\add gave themselves to men who were not their husbands\add* \f + \fk metaphor \f*, and they worshiped those idols. They were not like their
ancestors. Their ancestors obeyed what Yahweh commanded, but their descendants quickly stopped behaving as their ancestors had
behaved. 
\v 18 Whenever Yahweh brought a leader to them, he helped that leader and enabled his to rescue the people from their enemies.
He did that as long as that leader was alive. Yahweh pitied them as they groaned because they were being oppressed and caused
to suffer. 
\v 19 But after that leader died, the people went back to behaving in more evil ways than their ancestors had behaved. They
worshiped other gods and bowed down to them and did all \f + \fk litotes \f* the things that they thought those gods wanted them to do.
\p
\v 20 So Yahweh was very angry with the Israeli people. He said, “These people have disobeyed the agreement I made with their
ancestors They have not heeded what I told them. 
\v 21 So I will no longer expel the people-groups that Joshua left in this land when he died.
\v 22 I will use them to test the Israeli people to see whether they will do what I want them to do, as their ancestors did.”
\v 23 Yahweh had allowed these people-groups to stay in that land. He did not expel them by allowing Joshua
\add and his men\add* to defeat them.
