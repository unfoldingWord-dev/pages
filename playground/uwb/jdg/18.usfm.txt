\c 18  
\s The tribe of Dan took Micah's priest and his idols 
\p
\v 1 At that time the Israelis had no king. 
\p Also at that time, the tribe of Dan was still searching for some land where they could live. The other Israeli tribes had
\add been able to\add* ◄\add capture/take possession of\add*► \add the\add* land that had been allotted to them, but the tribe
of Dan had not been able to do that. 
\v 2 So they chose five soldiers from their clans, men who lived in Zorah and Eshtaol
\add cities\add*, to go through the land and explore it and try to find some land where their tribe could live.
\p They came to Micah's house in the hilly area where the tribe of Ephraim lived, and they stayed there that night.
\v 3 While they were in his house, when they heard the young man who had become Micah's priest talking, they recognized from
◄his accent/the way that he talked► \add that he was from the southern part of
Israel\add*. So they went to him and asked him, “Who brought you here? What are you doing here? Why did you come here?”
\p
\v 4 He told them the things that Micah had done for him. And he said, “Micah ◄has hired me/is paying me to work for him►, and
I have become his priest.” 
\p
\v 5 So they said to him, “Please ask God if we will succeed in what
\add we are trying to do\add* on this journey.” 
\p
\v 6 The young man replied, “Things will go well for you. Yahweh will go with you on this journey.”
\p
\v 7  \add The next day\add* the five men left. When they came to Laish
\add city\add*, they saw that the people there lived safely, like the people in Sidon
\add city\add* did. The people there thought that they were safe/protected
\add from any enemies\add*, and they had plenty of \add good fertile\add* land. They lived very far from the people of Sidon,
\add so the people of Sidon would not be able to help defend/protect
them\add*. They had no other ◄allies/groups nearby that would help them in battles►.
\p
\v 8 When those five men returned to Zorah and Eshtaol, their relatives asked them “What did you find out?”
\p
\v 9 They replied, “We have found some land, and it is very good. We should go and
\add attack\add* the people \add who live there\add*. Why are you staying here and doing nothing \f + \fk rhetorical question \f*? Do not wait any longer!
We should go immediately and take possession of that land! 
\v 10 When you go there, you will see that there is plenty of land, and it has everything
\add that we will need\add*. The people there are not expecting anyone to attack them. Surely God is giving that land to us.”
\p
\v 11 So six hundred men from the tribe of Dan left Zorah and Eshtaol, carrying their weapons.
\v 12 On their way they set up their tents near Kiriath-Jearim \add city\add* in
\add the area where the tribe of\add* Judah live. That is why the area west of Kiriath-Jearim was named 'Camp of Dan,' and that
is still its name. 
\v 13 From there, they went to the hilly area where the tribe of Ephraim lived. And they arrived at Micah's house.
\p
\v 14 The five men who had explored the land near Laish said to their fellow Israelis, “Do you know that in one of these houses
there is a sacred vest, several idols, and a statue? \add We think
that\add* you know what you should do.” \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* 
\v 15 So they went to the house where the man from the tribe of Levi lived, which was the house where Micah lived, and they
greeted the young man from the tribe of Levi \add who had become Micah's
priest\add*. 
\v 16 The six hundred men of the tribe of Dan stood outside the gate of the house, carrying their weapons.
\v 17 The five men who had explored the land went into Micah's house, and took all the idols, the sacred vest, and the statue.
While they did that, the six hundred men stood outside the gate,
\add talking with\add* the priest. 
\p
\v 18 When the priest saw them bringing out the idols and the sacred vest and the statue, he said to them, “What are you
doing?” 
\p
\v 19 They replied, “Be quiet! Do not say anything! You come with us and be
\add like\add* a father to us and a priest for us. Is it better for you to
\add stay here and\add* be a priest for the people in the house of one man, or to be a priest for a clan, and a priest for a
whole tribe of Israelis?” \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* 
\v 20 The priest liked what they were suggesting. So he took the sacred vest and the idols, and he
\add prepared to\add* go with the men from the tribe of Dan. 
\v 21 They all put their little children and their animals and everything else that they owned in front of them.
\p
\v 22 After they had gone a little distance from Micah's house, Micah
\add saw what was happening\add*. He quickly summoned the men who lived near him, and they ran and caught up with the men from
the tribe of Dan. 
\v 23 They shouted at them. The men of the tribe of Dan turned around and said to Micah, “What is the problem? Why have you
gathered these men \add to pursue us\add*?” 
\p
\v 24 Micah shouted, “You took the silver idols that were made for me! You also took my priest! I do not have anything left
\f + \fk rhetorical question \f*! So why do you ask me, ‘What is the problem?’ ” 
\p
\v 25 The men from the tribe of Dan replied, “You should not shout loudly like that! One of our angry men might attack you and
kill you and your family!” 
\v 26 Then the men from the tribe of Dan continued walking. Micah realized that there was a very large group of them,
\add so that it would be useless for him to try to fight them\add*. So he turned around and went home.
\p
\v 27 The men of the tribe of Dan were carrying the things that had been made for Micah, and they also took his priest, and
they continued traveling to Laish. They attacked the people who were peacefully living there, and killed them with their
swords, and then they burned everything in the city. 
\v 28 There was no group of people to rescue the people of Laish. Laish was far from Sidon
\add city, so the people who lived there could not help the people of
Laish\add*. And the people of Laish had no other allies. Laish was in a valley near Beth-Rehob
\add town\add*. 
\p The people of the tribe of Dan rebuilt the city and started to live there.
\v 29 They gave to the city a \add new\add* name, Dan, \add in honor
of\add* their ancestor Dan, who was one of the sons of Jacob. 
\v 30 The people of the tribe of Dan set up \add in the city\add* the idols
\add that had been made for Micah\add*. Jonathan, who was the son of Gershom and the grandson of Moses, was appointed to be
their priest. His descendants continued to be priests until the Israelis were captured and taken
\add to Assyria\add*. 
\v 31 After the people of the tribe of Dan set up the idols that has been made for Micah,
\add they worshiped those idols, even though\add* the Sacred Tent
\add where they had been commanded to worship\add* God, was at Shiloh.
