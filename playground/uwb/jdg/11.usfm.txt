\s Jephthah was chosen to be their leader 
\p
\v 1  \add There was a man\add* from the Gilead \add region\add* named Jephthah. He was a great warrior. His father was also
named Gilead. But his mother was a prostitute. 
\v 2 Gilead's wife gave birth to several sons. When they grew up, they forced Jephthah to leave home, saying to him, “You are
the son of a prostitute, \add not the son of our mother\add*. So
\add when our father dies\add*, you will not receive any of his property.”
\v 3 So Jephthah ran away from his brothers, and he went to the Tob region. While he was there, some worthless men started to
spend a lot of time with him. 
\p
\v 4 Some time later, the Ammon people-group started to fight against the Israelis.
\v 5 When that happened \\f + \\ft doublet \\f*, the leaders of the Gilead \add region\add* went to Jephthah to bring him back from the Tob
region \add to their area\add*. 
\v 6 They said to him, “Come \add with us\add* and lead our army, and
\add help us to\add* fight against the men from the Ammon people-group!”
\p
\v 7 But Jephthah replied, “You hated me \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* previously! You forced me to leave my father's house! So why are you coming to
me now, \add asking me to help you\add* when you are experiencing trouble?”
\p
\v 8 The leaders from Gilead replied, “\add Yes, we are having trouble,
and\add* that is the reason that we have come to you now. If you come with us and
\add help us to\add* fight against the Ammon people-group, \add after we defeat them, we will
appoint\add* you to be the leader of all us people in the Gilead
\add region\add*.” 
\p
\v 9 Jephthah replied, “If I go back to Gilead with you to fight against the Ammon people-group, and if Yahweh helps us to
defeat them, will you truly appoint me to be your leader?” 
\p
\v 10 They replied, “Yahweh is listening to everything that we say. So
\add he will punish us if\add* we do not do everything that you tell us to do.”
\v 11 So Jephthah went with them back to the Gilead \add region\add*, and the people appointed him to be their leader and the
commander of their army. And Jephthah solemnly promised to Yahweh there at Mizpah
\add to serve him well\add*. 
\s Jephthah's message to the king of the Ammon people-group 
\p
\v 12 Jephthah sent some messengers to the king of the Ammon people-group. They asked the king, “What have we
\add done to make you angry, with the result that\add* your army is coming to fight
\add against the people in\add* our land?” 
\p
\v 13 The king replied, “\add We have come to fight against you Israelis
because\add* you took our land when you came here from Egypt. You took all our land east of the Jordan
\add River\add*, from the Arnon \add River in the south\add* to the Jabbok
\add River in the north\add*. So if you now give it back to us, we ◄will have peace between us\f + \ft Or: will \f* not fight against you►.”
\p
\v 14  \add The messengers returned to Jephthah and told him what the king had
said\add*. So Jephthah sent the messengers to the king again. 
\v 15 They said to him, “This is what Jephthah says: ‘\add It is not
true\add* that we Israelis took the land from the Moab people-group and the Ammon people-group.
\v 16 When the Israeli people came out of Egypt, they walked through the desert to the Red Sea, and then
\add walked across it and traveled\add* to Kadesh \add town at the border of the Edom
region\add*. 
\v 17 They sent messengers to the king of the Edom people-group, to say to him, “Please allow us Israelis to walk across your
land.” But the king of the Edom people-group refused. Later we sent the same message to the king of the Moab people-group, but
he refused to allow the Israelis to go through his land. So the Israelis stayed at Kadesh
\add for a long time\add*. 
\v 18 Then the Israelis went into the desert and walked outside the borders of the Edom and Moab regions. They walked east of
the Moab region, east of the Arnon \add River, which is the eastern border of the Moab
region\add*. They did not cross that river to enter the Moab \add region\add*.
\p
\v 19 Then the Israelis sent a message to Sihon, the king of the Amor people-group, who lived in Heshbon
\add city\add*. They requested him, “Please allow us Israeli people to cross through your land to arrive at the land to which
we \add are going\add*.” 
\v 20 But Sihon did not trust the Israelis; \add he thought that they would steal some of the things in his
land\add*. So he gathered all his troops and they set up their tents at Jahaz
\add village\add* and then they attacked the Israelis. 
\v 21 But Yahweh, the God whom we Israelis \add worship\add*, enabled the Israeli army to defeat [IDO] Sihon and his army. Then
they ◄took possession of\f + \ft Or: started \f* to live in► all the land where the Amor people-group had lived.
\v 22 The Israelis took all the land that belonged to the Amor people-group, from the Arnon
\add River in the south\add* to the Jabbok \add River in the north\add*, and from the desert
\add in the east\add* to the Jordan \add River in the west\add*.
\p
\v 23 It was Yahweh, the God whom we Israelis \add worship\add*, who forced the Amor people-group to leave as the Israelis
advanced. So do you now think that you can force the Israelis to leave \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f*?
\v 24 You take the land that your god Chemosh has given to you. And we will live in the land that Yahweh our God has given to
us! 
\v 25 Are you better than Zippor's son Balak, who was the king of the Moab people-group? He never \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* quarreled with the
Israeli people, and he never started to fight against us \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f*! 
\v 26 For three hundred years the Israeli people have lived in Heshbon and Aroer
\add cities in your region\add*, and in the surrounding towns, and in all the cities along the Arnon
\add River\add*. Why have you people of the Ammon people-group not taken back those cities during all those years \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f*?
\v 27 We have not sinned against you, but you are sinning against me by attacking me
\add and my army\add*. I trust that Yahweh, the great judge, will decide whether we Israelis are right, or whether you people
of the Ammon people-group are right.’ ” 
\m
\v 28 But the king of the Ammon people-group did not pay attention to this message from Jephthah.
\p
\v 29 Then the Spirit of Yahweh took control of Jephthah. Jephthah went through the Gilead
\add region\add* and through the area where the tribe of Manasseh lived,
\add to enlist\f + \ft Or: gather \f* men for his army\add*. \add He finally gathered them
together\add* in Mizpah \add city\add* in the Gilead \add region\add* to fight against the Ammon people-group.
\v 30 There Jephthah made a solemn promise to Yahweh, saying “If you will enable my army to defeat [IDI] the Ammon
people-group, 
\v 31 when I return from the battle, I will sacrifice to you the first person who comes out of my house
\add to greet me\add*. It will belong to you.” 
\p
\v 32 Then Jephthah \add and his men\add* went from Mizpah to attack the Ammon people-group, and Yahweh enabled his army to
defeat them. 
\v 33 Jephthah and his men killed them, from Aroer \add city\add* all the way to the area around Minnith city. They destroyed
twenty cities, as far as Abel Keramim \add city\add*. So the Israelis
\add completely\add* defeated the Ammon people-group. 
\p
\v 34 When Jephthah returned to his home in Mizpah, his daughter was the first one to come out of the house to meet him. She
was \add joyfully\add* playing a tambourine and dancing. She was his only child; he had no sons and no other daughters.
\v 35 When Jephthah saw his daughter, he tore his clothes \add to show that he was very sad about what he was going to
do\add*. He said to her, “My daughter, you have caused me to become very sad \\f + \\ft doublet \\f* because I made a solemn promise to Yahweh
\add to sacrifice the first one who came out of my house\add*, and I must do what I promised.”
\p
\v 36 His daughter said, “My father, you made a solemn promise to Yahweh. So you must do to me what you promised, because
\add you said that you would do that if\add* Yahweh helped you to defeat our enemies, the Ammon people-group.”
\v 37 Then she also said, “But allow me to do one thing. ◄First\f + \ft Or: before \f* you do what you promised►, allow me to go up into the
hilly area and wander around for two months. Since I will never be married
\add and have children\add*, allow me and my friends to go and cry together.”
\p
\v 38 Jephthah replied, “All right, you may go.” So she left for two months. She and her friends stayed in the hills and they
cried for her because she would never be married. 
\v 39 After two months, she returned to her father Jephthah, and he did to her what he had solemnly promised. So his daughter
never was married. 
\p Because of that, the Israelis now have a custom. 
\v 40 Every year the young Israeli women go \add into the hills\add* for four days to remember
\add and cry about what happened to\add* the daughter of Jephthah.
