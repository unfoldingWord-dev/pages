\s Samson's riddle 
\p
\v 1 One day when Samson was in Timnah \add town\add*, he saw a young Philistine woman there.
\v 2 When he returned home, he told his mother and father, “I saw a young Philistine women in Timnah, and I want you to get her
for me so I can marry her.” 
\p
\v 3 His mother and father objected very strongly. They said, “Is there no woman from our tribe, or from the other Israeli
tribes, that you could marry? Why must you go to the heathen Philistines to get a wife?”
\p But Samson told his father, “Get her for me! She is the one I want!”
\v 4 His mother and father did not realize that Yahweh was arranging this. He was preparing a way for
\add Samson to defeat\add* the Philistines, who were ruling over Israel at that time.
\v 5 So, as Samson was going down to Timnah with his mother and father, a young lion attacked Samson near the vineyards close
to Timnah. 
\v 6 Then Yahweh's Spirit came upon Samson powerfully, with the result that he tore the lion apart with his hands. He did it
\add as easily\add* as if it were a young goat. But he did not tell his mother and father about it.
\v 7 When they arrived in Timnah, Samson talked with the young woman, and he liked her very much.
\add And his father made arrangements for the wedding\add*. 
\p
\v 8 Later, when Samson returned to Timnah for the wedding, he turned off the path to see the carcass of the lion. He
discovered that \add after other creatures had eaten all the flesh\add*, a swarm of bees
\add had made a nest in the skeleton and\add* had made some honey.
\v 9 So he scooped some of the honey into his hands and ate some of it as he was walking along. He also gave some of it to his
mother and father, but he did not tell them that he had taken the honey from the skeleton of the lion,
\add because anyone dedicated to God was not to touch a corpse\add*.
\p
\v 10 As his father was making the final arrangements for the marriage, Samson gave a party
\add for the young men in that area\add*. That was the custom for men to do when they were about to be married.
\v 11 Thirty young man were invited to the party. 
\p
\v 12 Samson said to them, “Allow me to tell you a riddle. If you give me the meaning of my riddle during these seven days of
the celebration, I will give each one of you a linen robe and an extra set of clothes.
\v 13 But if you cannot tell me the meaning, you must each give me a linen robe and an extra set of clothes.” They replied,
“All right. Tell us your riddle.” 
\p
\v 14 So he said, 
\q “From the thing that eats came something to eat; 
\q2 out of something strong came something sweet.” 
\m But for three days they could not tell him the meaning of the riddle.
\p
\v 15 On the fourth day, they said to Samson's bride, “Ask your husband to tell you the meaning of the riddle. If you do not do
that, we will burn down your father's house, with you inside it! Did you invite us here only to make us poor
\add by forcing us to buy a lot of clothes for your husband\add*?”
\p
\v 16 So Samson's wife came to him, crying, and said to him, “You do not really love me. You hate me! You have told a riddle to
my friends, but you have not told me the meaning of the riddle!”
\p He replied, “I have not told the meaning of the riddle even to my mother and father, so why should I tell it to you?”
\v 17 She continued to cry every time she was with him, all during the rest of the celebration. Finally, on the seventh day,
because she continued to nag him, he told her the meaning of the riddle. Then she told it to the young men.
\p
\v 18 So, before sunset on the seventh day, the young men came to Samson and said to him,
\q What\f + \ft Or: Nothing \f* is sweeter than honey \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*. 
\q2 What\f + \ft Or: Nothing \f* is stronger than a lion \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*! 
\p Samson replied, “\add Heifers do not\add* plow fields. \add My bride is
like\add* a young heifer \f + \ft metaphor \f*. 
\q If you had not forced her to ask me, 
\q2 you would not have determined the meaning of my riddle!” 
\p
\v 19 Then Yahweh's Spirit powerfully took control of Samson. He went down to
\add the coast at\add* Ashkelon town, and killed thirty men. He took their clothes
\add and went back to Timnah\add* and gave them to the men who had told him he meaning of the riddle. But he was very angry
about what had happened, so he went back home to live with his mother and father.
\v 20 So his wife was given\f + \ft Or: the bride's father gave his wife \f* to the man who was the bride's best friend, who was there at the
wedding, \add but Samson did not know that\add*.
