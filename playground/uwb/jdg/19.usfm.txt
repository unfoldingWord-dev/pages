\c 19  
\s A Levite and his concubine 
\p
\v 1 At that time the Israeli people had no king. 
\p There was a man from the tribe of Levi who lived in a remote place in the hilly area where the tribe of Ephraim lives. He
had previously taken to live with him a woman who was a slave. She was from Bethlehem, in the area where the tribe of Judah
lives. 
\v 2 But she started to sleep with other men also. Then she left him and returned to her father's house in Bethlehem. She
stayed there for four months. 
\v 3 Then her husband took his servant and two donkeys and went to Bethlehem. He went to ask her to come back to live with him
again. When he arrived at her father's house, she invited him to come in. Her father was happy to see him.
\v 4 The woman's father asked him to stay. So he stayed there for three days. During that time he ate and drank and slept
there. 
\p
\v 5 On the fourth day, they all got up early in the morning. The man from the tribe of Levi was preparing to leave, but the
woman's father said to him, “Eat something before you go.” 
\v 6 So the two men sat down to eat and drink together. Then the woman's father said to him, “Please stay another night.
Relax/Rest and have a joyful time.” 
\v 7 The man from the tribe of Levi wanted to leave, but the woman's father requested him to stay one more night. So he stayed
again that night. 
\v 8 On the fifth day, the man got up early and prepared to leave. But the woman's father said to him again, “Have something to
eat. Wait until this afternoon, \add and then leave\add*.” So the two men ate together.
\p
\v 9 In the afternoon, when the man from the tribe of Levi and his slave wife and his servant got up to leave, the woman's
father said, “It will soon be dark. The day is almost finished. Stay here tonight and have a good/joyful time. Tomorrow morning
you can get up early and leave for your home.” 
\v 10 But the man from the tribe of Levi did not want to stay for another night. He put saddles on his two donkeys, and started
to go with his slave wife \add and his servant\add* toward Jebus
\add city\add*, which is \add now named\add* Jerusalem. 
\p
\v 11 When it was late in the afternoon, they came near to Jebus. The servant said to his master, “We should stop in this city
where the Jebus people-group live, and stay here tonight.” 
\p
\v 12 But his master said, “No, it would not be good for us to stay here where foreign people live. There are no Israeli people
here. We will go on to Gibeah \add city\add*.” 
\v 13 He said to his servant, “Let's go. It is not far to Gibeah. We can go there, or we can go a bit further to Ramah. We can
stay in one of those two cities tonight.” 
\v 14 So they continued walking. When they came near to Gibeah, where people from the tribe of Benjamin live, the sun was
setting. 
\v 15 They stopped to stay there that night. They went to the public square of that city and sat down. But no one
\add who passed by\add* invited them to stay in their house for that night.
\p
\v 16 Finally, in the evening, an old man came by. He had been working in the fields. He was from the hilly area of the tribe
of Ephraim, but at that time he was living in Gibeah. 
\v 17 He realized that the man from the tribe of Levi was only traveling and did not have a home in that city. So he asked the
man, “Where have you come from? And where are you going?” 
\p
\v 18 He replied, “We are traveling from Bethlehem to my home in the hilly area where people of the tribe of Ephraim live. I
went from there to Bethlehem, but now we are going to \add Shiloh\add* where Yahweh's Sacred tent \f + \ft (OR, my house) \f* is. No one
here has invited us to stay in their house tonight. 
\v 19 We have straw and food for our donkeys, and bread and wine for me and the young woman and my servant. We do not need
anything else.” 
\p
\v 20 The old man said, “I wish that things will go well for you, but I would like to provide what you need. Do not stay here
in the square tonight.” 
\v 21 Then the old man took them to his house. He gave food to the donkeys. He
\add gave water to the man and the woman and the servant to\add* wash their feet. And the old man gave them something to eat
and drink. 
\p
\v 22 While they were having a good/joyful time together, some wicked men from that city surrounded the house and started to
bang on the door. They shouted to the old man, “Bring out to us the man who has come to your house. We want to have sex with
him.” 
\p
\v 23 The old man went outside and said to them, “Friends, I will not do that. That would be a very evil thing. This man is a
guest in my house. You should not do such a terrible/disgraceful/shameful thing!
\v 24 Look, my daughter is here. She is \add still\add* a virgin. And this man's slave wife is here. I will bring them out to
you now. You may do to them whatever you wish, but do not do such a terrible/disgraceful/shameful thing to this young man!”
\p
\v 25 But the men did not pay attention to what he said. So the man from the tribe of Levi took his slave wife and sent her to
them, outside the house. They raped \f + \fk euphemism \f* her and abused her all the night. Then at dawn, they allowed her to go.
\v 26 She returned to the old man's house, where her husband was staying, but she fell down at the doorway and lay there all
night. 
\p
\v 27 The next morning, when the man from the tribe of Levi got up, he went outside, of the house to continue his journey. He
saw his slave wife lying there at the doorway of the house. Her hands were on the doorsill.
\v 28 He said to her, “Get up! Let's go!” But she did not answer,
\add because she had died\add*. He put her body on the donkey, and they traveled to his home.
\p
\v 29 When he arrived at his home, he took a knife and he cut the body of the slave woman into twelve pieces. Then he sent one
piece to each area of Israel, \add along with a message telling what had
happened\add*. 
\v 30 Everyone who saw a piece of the body and the message said, “Nothing like this has ever happened before. Not since our
ancestors left Egypt \add have we heard of such a terrible thing\add*. We need to think carefully about it. Someone should
decide what we should do.”
