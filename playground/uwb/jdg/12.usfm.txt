\c 12  
\s Jephthah's army defeated the tribe of Ephraim 
\p
\v 1 The men of the tribe of Ephraim summoned their soldiers, and they crossed the
\add Jordan River\add* to Zaphon \add town to talk with\add* Jephthah. They said to him, "Why did you not request us\f + \ft Or: You
should have requested us \f* to help your army fight the Ammon people-group. So we will burn down your house while you are in it."
\p
\v 2 Jephthah replied, "The Ammon people-group were oppressing us greatly. When we were prepared to start to attack them, I
requested you to come and help us, but you refused. My men and I defeated the Ammon people-group, but you did not help us.
\v 3 When I saw that you would not help us, I was willing to be killed in the battle against the Ammon people-group. But Yahweh
helped us to defeat them. \add You did not help us when we requested it
before\add*, so why have you come here today to fight against me?\f + \ft Or: you should not have come here today to fight against me. \f*"
\f + \ft rhetorical question \f* 
\p
\v 4 Then Jephthah summoned the men of the Gilead \add region\add* to fight
\add against the men of the tribe of\add* Ephraim. The men of the tribe of Ephraim said, "You men from the Gilead
\add region\add* are men who deserted us. Long ago you left us and moved to the area between our tribe and the tribe of
Manasseh." \add Because of their saying that\add*, the men of the Gilead
\add region\add* attacked the men of the tribe of Ephraim. 
\v 5 The men of Gilead captured that ford\f + \ft Or: place where people can walk across \f* at the Jordan
\add River\add* to go to the land where the tribe of Ephraim live. If someone from the tribe of Ephraim came to the ford to try
to escape, he would say, "Allow me to cross the river." Then the men of Gilead would ask him, "Are you from the tribe of
Ephraim?" If he said "No," 
\v 6 they would say to him, "Say the word 'Shibboleth'." The men of Ephraim could not pronounce that word correctly. So if the
person from the tribe of Ephraim said 'Sibboleth', \add they would know that he was lying and that he was really from the tribe
of Ephraim\add*, and they would kill him there at the ford. 
\p So the men of Gilead killed 42,000 people from the tribe of Ephraim at that time.

\v 7 Jephthah, the man from the Gilead \add region\add*, was a leader of the Israeli people for six years. Then he died and was
buried in a town in the Gilead \add region\add*. 
\s Ibzan became their leader 
\p
\v 8 After Jephthah died, a man named Ibzan, from Bethlehem, became a leader of the Israeli people.
\v 9 He had thirty sons and thirty daughters. He allowed them all to marry people who were not in his clan. He was a leader of
the Israeli people for seven years. 
\v 10 When he died he was buried in Bethlehem. 
\s Elon became their leader 
\p
\v 11 After Ibzan died, a man named Elon, from the tribe of Zebulun, became a leader of the Israeli people. He was their leader
for ten years. 
\v 12 Then he died and was buried in Aijalon \add city\add* in the area where the tribe of Zebulun lives.
\s Abdon became their leader 
\p
\v 13 After Elon died, a man named Abdon who was the son of Hillel, from Pirathon
\add city, in the area where the tribe of Ephraim live\add* became a leader of the Israeli people.
\v 14 He had forty sons and thirty grandsons. Each of them had his own donkey on which to ride. Abdon was a leader of the
Israeli people for eight years. 
\v 15 When Abdon died, he was buried in Pirathon, in the hilly area where the descendants of Amalek lived previously,
\add but now it is in the area where the tribe of Ephraim lives\add*.
