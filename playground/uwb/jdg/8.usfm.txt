\c 8  
\s Gideon killed Zebah and Zalmunna 
\p
\v 1 Then the descendants of Ephraim said to Gideon, “Why did have you acted toward us like this? When you went out to fight
against the people of Midian, why did you not summon us \add to help
you\add*?” They rebuked Gideon severely. 
\p
\v 2 But Gideon replied, “I have done \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* very little compared with what you have done! My small clan of descendants of
Abiezer only started the battle, but \add your very large group of\add* descendants of Ephraim
\add helped me very much at the end, and finished the task very well. It is
like\add* the final grapes of the harvest being much better than the first grapes that are picked.
\v 3 God enabled you to defeat Oreb and Zeeb, the generals of the army from Midian. That is \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* much more important than what
I did!” After Gideon told them that, they no longer resented what he had done.
\p
\v 4 Then Gideon and his 300 men \add went east and\add* crossed the Jordan
\add River\add*. Although they were very tired, they continued to pursue their enemies.
\v 5 When they arrived at Succoth \add town\add*, Gideon said to the town leaders, “Please give my men some food! They are very
tired. We are pursuing Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian.”
\p
\v 6 But the leaders of Succoth replied, “You have not caught \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* Zebah and Zalmunna yet. So why should we give food to your
troops \add now? Catch them first, and then we will give you food\add*.”
\p
\v 7 Gideon replied, “\add Because you said that\add*, after Yahweh enables us to defeat Zebah and Zalmunna, we will return.
And then we will make whips from thorns from the desert, and with them we will rip the flesh off your bones!”
\p
\v 8 From there, Gideon \add and his 300 men\add* went to Peniel and ask for food there, but the people gave him the same
answer. 
\v 9 So he said to the men of Peniel, “After I defeat those kings, I will return and tear down this tower!”
\p
\v 10 By that time, Zebah and Zalmunna had gone to Karkor \add town\add* with 15,000 troops. They were all that were left of
the armies that had come from the east. 150,000 of their men had already been killed.
\v 11 Gideon \add and his men\add* went east along the road on which caravans travel. They went past Nobah and Jogbehah
\add villages\add* and arrived at the enemy camp by surprise. 
\v 12 Zebah and Zalmunna fled, but Gideon's men pursued them and captured them and all their warriors.
\p
\v 13 After that, Gideon and his men \add took Zebah and Zalmunna with them
and\add* started to return, going through Heres Pass. 
\v 14 There he captured a young man from Succoth, and demanded that he write down the names of all of the leaders in the town.
The young man wrote down seventy-seven names. 
\v 15 Then Gideon and his men returned to Succoth and said to those leaders, “Here are Zebah and Zalmunna. When we were here
before, you made fun of me and said ‘You have not \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* caught Zebah and Zalmunna yet! After you catch them, we will give your
exhausted men some food.’ ” 
\v 16 Then Gideon's men took the town leaders and whipped them with whips made from briers from the desert, to teach them
\add that they deserved to be punished for doing things like that\add*.
\v 17 Then \add they went to\add* Peniel and tore down the tower, and killed all the men in the town.
\p
\v 18 Then Gideon said to Zebah and Zalmunna, “The men you killed near Tabor
\add Mountain\add*, what did they look like?” 
\p They replied, “They were like you; they all looked like they were sons of a king.”
\p
\v 19 Gideon replied, “They were my brothers! Just as surely as Yahweh lives, I would not kill you if you had not killed them.”
\v 20 Then he turned to his oldest son, Jether. He said to him, “Kill them!” But Jether was only a boy, and he was afraid, so
he did not pull out his dagger \add to kill them\add*. 
\p
\v 21 Then Zebah and Zalmunna said to Gideon, “Do not ask a young boy to do the work that a man should do!” So Gideon killed
both of them. Then he took the gold ornaments from the necks of their camels.
\s Gideon refused to be their king 
\p
\v 22 Then a group of Israeli men \add came to\add* Gideon and said to him, “You be our ruler!
\add We want\add* you and your son and your grandsons to be our rulers, because you rescued us from the Midian army.”
\p
\v 23 But Gideon replied, “No, I will not rule over you, and my son will not rule over you. Yahweh will rule over you.”
\v 24 Then he said, “I request only one thing. I request that each of you give me one earring from the things you captured
after the battle.” 
\p [All the men descended from Ishmael wore earrings.] 
\v 25 They replied, “We will be glad to give earrings to you!” So they spread a cloth
\add on the ground\add*, and each man threw on it one gold earring that he had taken
\add from a man he had killed in the battle\add*. 
\v 26 The weight of all the earrings was ◄43 pounds\f + \ft Or: 19 \f*.4 kg.►. That did not include other things
\add that they gave to Gideon\add*—the other ornaments or the pendants or the clothes that their kings wore or the gold chains
that were on the necks of their camels. 
\v 27 Gideon made\f + \ft Or: decorated \f* a sacred vest from the gold, and later he put it in his hometown, Ophrah. But soon the Israeli
people started to worship the vest. So it became like a trap \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* for the people,
\add causing them to worship it instead of worshiping only God\add*.
\s Gideon died 
\p
\v 28 That is how the Israelis defeated the people from Midian. The people of Midian did not become strong enough to attack
Israel again. So while Gideon was alive, there was peace in the land for forty years.
\p
\v 29 Gideon went back home to live there. 
\v 30 He had many wives, and they bore him seventy sons. 
\v 31 He also had a slave wife in Shechem \add town\add*, who bore him a son whom he named Abimelech.
\v 32 Gideon died when he was very old. They buried his body in the grave where his father Joash was buried, at Ophrah, in the
land belonging to the descendants of Abiether. 
\p
\v 33 But as soon as Gideon died, the Israelis \add left God and gave themselves to worship the images of the god Baal,
like\add* \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* adultresses leave their husbands and go to other men. They made a
\add statue of a\add* new god called Baal-Berith. 
\v 34 They forgot about Yahweh, the one who had rescued them from all their enemies that surrounded them.
\v 35 And even though Gideon had done many good things for the Israelis, they did not act kindly toward Gideon's family.
