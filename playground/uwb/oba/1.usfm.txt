\c 1  
\s Yahweh will punish the Edomites 
\p
\v 1 This is a message that Yahweh our God gave to me, Obadiah, about the Edom
\add people-group\add*. 
\p Yahweh our God has told me this about \add the people of\add* Edom:
\q “I, Yahweh, have sent a messenger to other nations, 
\q2 telling them to prepare to go and attack Edom.” 
\b
\p
\v 2 And Yahweh says this to the people of Edom: 
\q “I will soon cause you to become the weakest and most despised nation
\add on the earth\add*. 
\q
\v 3 Your \add capital city\add* is high in the rocky cliffs, 
\q2 and you are very proud; 
\q you think that you are safe because no army can attack you \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*,
\q2 but you [IDI] have deceived yourselves. 
\q
\v 4 And I tell you that even if \add you had wings and\add* could fly higher than eagles fly,
\q2 and if you could make your homes among the stars, 
\q2 I would bring you \add crashing\add* down from there. 
\b
\q
\v 5 When thieves break into someone's house during the night, 
\q2 they certainly \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* steal only the things that they want. 
\q And people who pick grapes always \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* leave a few grapes on the vines.
\q2 But your country will be completely destroyed! 
\q
\v 6 Everything that is valuable will be taken away. 
\q2 \add Your enemies\add* will find and take away even the valuable things that you have hidden.
\q
\v 7 All your allies\f + \ft Or: nations who promised to help you \f* will turn against you,
\q2 and they will force you to leave your country\f + \ft Or: land \f*. 
\q Those with whom you have peace now will trick\f + \ft Or: deceive \f* you and defeat you.
\q2 Those who eat meals with you now are planning to trap you, 
\q and then they will say to you, ‘You are not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* as clever as you thought you were!’
\b
\q
\v 8 I, Yahweh, declare that at the time that I destroy Edom, 
\q2 I will punish the men who live in those cliffs who \add thought that
they\add* were wise. 
\q
\v 9 The soldiers from Teman \add town\add* will become terrified;
\q2 all you people who are descendants of Esau will be wiped out\f + \ft Or: killed \f*.”
\s The reasons for Edom's punishment 
\q
\v 10 “You acted cruelly to your relatives who are descendants of Jacob,
\add the twin brother of your ancestor Esau\add*. 
\q2 So now you will be disgraced, and you will be destroyed forever.
\q
\v 11 Foreigners entered the gates of Jerusalem 
\q2 and cast lots\f + \ft Or: threw small stones that were marked \f* to decide what valuable things they would take away;
\q but you were as bad as those foreigners, 
\q2 because you just stood there and did not help the Israelis. 
\q
\v 12 You should not have gloated\f + \ft Or: been happy \f* about the disaster that the Israelis were experiencing.
\q2 You should not have been happy when their towns were ruined.
\q You should not have made fun of them when they were suffering.
\q
\v 13 They are my people, 
\q2 so you should not have entered their \add city\add* gates when they were experiencing those disasters
\q and you should not have laughed at them. 
\q2 And you should not have taken away their valuable possessions.
\q
\v 14 You should not have stood at crossroads 
\q2 to catch those who were \add trying to\add* escape. 
\q You should not have \add captured them and\add* put them into the hands of
\add their enemies\add* 
\q2 when they were experiencing those disasters.” 
\s God will punish all the nearby nations 
\q
\v 15 “There will soon be the time when I, Yahweh, will judge \add and
punish\add* all the nations. 
\q2 And you \add people of Edom\add* will experience the same \add disasters\add* that you caused others to experience.
\q The same evil things that you have done to others will happen to you.
\q
\v 16 My people in Jerusalem have been punished; 
\q2 \add it is as though\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* they drank a cup of very bitter liquid on Zion, my sacred hill,
\q2 because I was very angry with them. 
\q But I will punish \f + \ft metaphor \f* all the other nations even more severely,
\q2 and cause them to disappear completely. 
\q
\v 17 But some people in Jerusalem will escape, 
\q2 and Jerusalem will become a very holy\f + \ft Or: sacred \f* place. 
\q Then the descendants of Jacob will conquer and possess again the land that truly belongs to them.
\q
\v 18 The descendants \f + \ft metonymy \f* of Jacob and his son Joseph will be like \f + \ft metaphor \f* a fire,
\q2 and the people \f + \ft metonymy \f* of Edom will be like \f + \ft metaphor \f* stubble that will be completely burned in that fire.
\q2 Not one person will remain alive. 
\q \add That will surely happen because\add* I, Yahweh, have said it.”
\b
\q
\v 19 The Israeli people who live in the southern desert are the ones who will capture Edom.
\q2 And those who live in the western foothills will capture the Phoenicia
\add region\add* and the areas of Ephraim and Samaria. 
\q And people of the tribe of Benjamin will conquer the Gilead \add region\add*.
\q
\v 20 Those who return from being exiled in\f + \ft Or: forced to go to \f* \add Babylon\add* will
\add return to their land\add* 
\q2 \add and\add* capture the Phoenicia \add region\add* as far north as Zarephath
\add on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea\add*. 
\q People of Jerusalem who were captured and taken to Sardis, \add the capital city of the Lydia
region\add*, will capture the towns in the southern desert. 
\q
\v 21 The army of Jerusalem will attack Edom and conquer it, 
\q2 and Yahweh will be their king.
