\c 3  
\s 2 Corinthians 3:1-6 
\s The way you now live proves that we teach the truth about Jesus Christ.
\p
\v 1  \add As I write these things about myself\add*, I am \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* not
\add doing it\add* to boast about how good I am, \add as some of you say I
do\add*. Some people always carry letters with them that tell how well they work,
\add that other people\add* have \add written\add*. But I do not \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* need
\add to bring\add* letters like that \add when I come to you\add*. Nor do I need to ask you
\add to write\add* letters like that \add for me when I go to other
congregations\add*. 
\v 2 You yourselves are \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* \add like a\add* letter that recommends my work
\add for God to everyone\add*. People see \add how Christ changed\add* your
\add lives when you believed the message that I taught you\add*. Everyone
\add who knows you\add* can see \add the result of my work for God\add*.
\v 3 You are \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* \add like\add* a letter that Christ himself \add has
written\add* that says good things about \add my work for God in your
lives\add*. You show \add people by the way you now conduct your lives that God has changed your
lives\add* as a result of my work \add among you. People did\add* not
\add find out about you by\add* reading \add a letter that was written to them on
paper\add* with \add pen and\add* ink. Instead, \add they saw how\add* the Spirit of the all-powerful God
\add has changed your lives\add*. Nor \add did people find out about you by
reading\add* a letter that was carved on stone slabs \add like the stone slabs that God gave to
Moses\add*. Instead, \add it was the change that God's Spirit made
in\add* your lives \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* \add that they saw\add*. 
\p
\v 4 I \add can very\add* confidently \add write these things about the work that Silas, Timothy, and I did among you, because
God knows that what I write is true. We(exc) are true workers\add* for
God\add because of what\add* Christ \add has done for us\add*. 
\v 5 We\add (exc)\add*, by ourselves, do not have the ability \add to do this
work\add*. None of us \add apostles\add* can say, “\add I have changed the lives of these
people\add*.” God is the one \add who has given us this ability\add*.
\v 6 He is the one who enables us\add (exc)\add* to be his messengers.
\add He has enabled us to tell people the message\add* about the new agreement
\add that he is making with them\add*. This is not a \add message about obeying all
the\add* written laws \add of his old agreement that he made with the Jewish
people\add*. Instead, \add it is a message about God giving us his\add* Spirit.
\add Previously, God condemned people to be\add* separated from him forever
\add if they did not obey his laws\add*. But by \add God's new agreement\add* his Spirit enables people to live
\add eternally\add*. 
\s 2 Corinthians 3:7-11 
\s Our work of teaching people about God's New Agreement is much greater than the work of teaching people about his Old
Agreement. 
\p
\v 7  \add Moses\add* taught \add the people that if they did not obey God's laws completely they would
be\add* separated from God forever. God wrote \add his laws\add* on stone slabs.
\add Then he gave them to Moses to teach them to the people. Although God's laws
condemned\add* the people to die, \add when Moses brought those laws down from
Sinai\add* Mountain\add , God caused Moses' face to shine\add* with radiance
\add to show the people that these laws were God's laws\add*. The radiance was
\add so bright that\add* the people of Israel could not keep looking at Moses' face.
\add They had to look away\add*. But although the radiance \add was bright,
it\add* was slowly fading away. 
\v 8  \add So\add*, \add since God showed in such a wonderful way that those laws that condemned them to die were from
him\add*, surely when we\add (exc)\add* teach \add people about how
God's\add* Spirit will \add change their lives\add*, ◄\add God will
show\add* in an even more wonderful way \add that\add* it is \add his message.\f + \ft Or: will \f* not God
show\add* in an even more wonderful way \add that\add* it is \add his
message\add*?► \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* 
\v 9 The message \add that Moses taught them was wonderful, but when people
heard\add* that message, \add they realized that they were sinners and that
God\add* would punish them. But God's message that we\add (exc) teach is
a\add* much more wonderful message. We teach people that God will ◄erase the record of\f + \ft Or: declare \f* people no longer guilty for►
\add the sinful things that they have done\add*. 
\v 10  \add The truth is that, although the work of teaching the people to obey God's
laws\add* was once important, it is not as important now, because
\add the work of teaching people that God will forgive them and\add* enable them to live to please him is far more important.
\v 11 Furthermore, \add the message that Moses taught was not a lasting message, just
like\add* the brightness on his face was not lasting and soon faded away. But
\add when God gives his Spirit to people\add*, the wonderful work that
\add God's Spirit does in their lives\add* is much greater \add because\add* it lasts forever.
\s 2 Corinthians 3:12-18 
\s We teach a message that transforms people's lives. So we teach it with great confidence.
\p
\v 12 We\add (exc)\add* know that the message that we teach is a
\add much more wonderful message than the message that Moses taught\add*. So we
\add can preach\add* boldly. 
\v 13 We do not \add need to put a veil over our faces when we teach
people\add*, as Moses did. Moses put a veil over his face so that the Israelites would not see that the radiance
\add on his face\add* soon faded away. \add Similarly, the glory of the old agreement has also faded
away\add*. 
\v 14 But the Israelites stubbornly refused to \add understand that the old agreement would
end\add*. Even now, when they read the old agreement, \add they still do not realize that it has ended. It is as
if\add* \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* that same veil \add that Moses put on his face\add* is now over their
\add minds, keeping them from understanding God's true message\add*. They will
\add understand that message\add* only when \add they come to trust\add* in Christ. Then
\add it will be as though God\add* has removed the veil. 
\v 15  \add Throughout all these years\add*, even until now, when
\add the Israelites\add* read what Moses \add write, it is as though\add* a veil is covering their minds.
\v 16 But when any of them believes in the Lord \add Jesus\add*,
\add God\add* removes that veil from them. 
\v 17  \add It is by the power of his\add* Spirit that the Lord \add works in our
lives\add*, and the Lord's Spirit has set us free \add from trying to obey the all the rules and rituals that God gave
Moses\add*. 
\v 18  \add It is as though God\add* has removed the veil from our faces \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f*. We realize how awesome Jesus is. As we realize
that, we are continually being changed {\add the Holy Spirit is\add* continually changing us} to become more and more like
Jesus, \add so that people can see\add*, more and more, how awesome
\add Jesus is\add*. It is the Spirit of the Lord who does \add this\add*.
