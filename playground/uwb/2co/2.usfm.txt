\v 1 Anyway, I definitely decided that I would not come to visit you again
\add now. If I had come, I would have spoken severely to you again,
and\add* I would have made you unhappy as I did the last time \add I visited
you\add*. 
\v 2  \add And\add* if I make you unhappy, I will have made unhappy
\add the only people who can cheer me up\add*, so there will be none of you to cheer me up!\f + \ft Or: who would cheer me up? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 3 So, \add instead of going to visit you at that time\add*, I wrote a letter
\add and sent it to you\add*. I wrote it the way I did so that \add you would know what you should do.
Then\add* when I come to visit you, you will not make me unhappy when you should be causing me to rejoice. I was quite sure
that all of you \add would do what I told you to do in that letter, and because of
that\add* I would be happy and you would be happy, too. 
\v 4 I wrote to you \add the way I did\add* because I felt very troubled and distressed about you. I was even crying very much
as I wrote. \add My purpose in writing was\add* not in order to make you feel bad, but, instead, in order that you might know
how deeply\f + \ft Or: much \f* I love you. 
\p
\v 5  \add Now I want to write about the man who\add* caused all this anguish.
\add What he did was very wrong, but\add* I know that it has caused you much more sorrow than it has caused me, because
\add what he did\add* has \add affected\add* all of you \add to some extent. I
say\add*, “to some extent,” \add because I do not want to say that he
has\add* done more harm \add than he really has done\add*. 
\v 6  \add Since he has now stopped sinning in that way\add*, the punishment that nearly all of you
\add decided was right for him\add* has continued long enough. 
\v 7 So now, instead \add of punishing him any longer\add*, you need to forgive him and deal kindly with him.
\add If you do not forgive him\add*, he may become so sad that he will begin to
\add think that you will never forgive him\add* \f + \ft Or: will stop \add believing in
Christ\add* \f*. 
\p
\v 8 For those reasons, I beg you to \add forgive him and accept him into your group again, and
thus\add* assure him that you truly love him. 
\v 9  \add I feel sure that you will do as I ask\add*, because when I wrote
\add severely\add* to you \add before\add*, I did it to test you by seeing whether or not you really would do everything
\add that I, as your apostle, asked you to do\add*. 
\v 10 So \add since you obeyed what I told you before, I feel sure that now you will obey what I am writing in this
letter\add* and forgive the man, as I have done, because I indeed have forgiven him for the wrong thing that he did. Anything
he needed me to forgive him for, I have forgiven, and Christ knows
\add that I have forgiven him sincerely. I have done that mainly\add* to help you
\add so that you and I will again have fellowship with each other, and that you will accept him into your group
again\add*. 
\v 11  \add I want you to forgive him\add* so that Satan will not be able to take advantage of
\add the problems among\add* us \add and make the situation worse\add*. We know very well \f + \ft litotes \f* that he is always planning to
\add cause problems among us\add*. 
\s 2 Corinthians 2:12-17 
\s I did not find Titus in Troas, so I went on to Macedonia province. Everywhere we go, God causes people to know Christ
through our teaching. We do not teach in order to get money; we teach with sincere motives.
\p
\v 12  \add I will continue by telling you what I did after I wrote to you from Ephesus
city\add*. I went to Troas \add city\add* in order to \add tell people\add* the message
\add about\add* Christ. \add When I arrived there\add*, I found \add many
people\add* who had been prepared by the Lord \add Jesus\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*
\add to listen to what I told them about him\add*. 
\v 13 But because my fellow believer Titus had not \add arrived with a report from
you\add*, I still felt very anxious and concerned \add about you\add*. So,
\add after spending only a short time at Troas\add*, I said ‘goodbye’ to
\add the believers who were there\add* and came \add here\add* to Macedonia
\add province to find Titus\add*. 
\v 14 However, \add before I tell you anymore about that\add*, I
\add want to\add* thank God \add for what he is doing. As a great leader of fighting men causes all his prisoners to take part
in his victory parade\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, God leads us \add who are his workers\add* to always win out
\add over Satan because of our(exc) close relationship with Christ. God causes people to come
to\add* know Jesus Christ as a result of our\add (exc) teaching his message. That message is
like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* the smell of perfume. 
\v 15  \add When we(exc) tell God's message\add* about Christ, it
\add spreads out among people\add* like the smell of perfume. \add Those who believe the message that we tell
them\add* are saved {\add Jesus Christ\add* saves them} \add from the guilt of their sin. But those who reject that
message\add* will be separated from God \add forever\add*. 
\v 16 To those who \add are on the way to hell, our message is like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* a foul smell
\add because it is about dying\add* and being separated from God forever. But, to
those\add on the way to heaven, the message that we teach is like\add* a pure fragrant smell,
\add because we tell them\add* that they will live \add forever with God. As we think about that, we
think\add* ◄no one can have enough ability \add to do\add* such important work
\add for God!\add*\f + \ft Or: how \f* can anyone have enough ability \add to do\add* such important work
\add for God\add*?► \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* 
\v 17  \add But perhaps God considers us(exc) sufficient\add*, because we do not work\f + \ft Or: act \f* like so many
\add others whom you know\add*. They teach God's message in a way that
\add they think people will like, and they think that\add* people will pay them for teaching that way.
We\add (exc) certainly do not do that\add*. On the contrary, \add as servants
of\add* Christ, and knowing that God is watching us\add (exc)\add*, we teach sincerely
\add the message that\add* God sent us to proclaim.
