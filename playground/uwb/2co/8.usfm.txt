\c 8  
\s 2 Corinthians 8:1-15 
\s The believers in Macedonia have already collected the money that they are going to send to the believers in Jerusalem. You
should also finish collecting the money that you are preparing to send, and have it ready to send to Jerusalem soon.
\p
\v 1 Now, my fellow believers, I want to tell you \add the results
of\add* God's \add acting\add* kindly \add in the lives\add* of \add the believers
in\add* the congregations \add here\add* in Macedonia \add province\add*.
\v 2 Even though \add the non-believers here\add* have been severely causing the believers to suffer, the believers are always
rejoicing very much. \add Although they\add* are very poor, \add they
gave\add* very generously \add to help other believers\add*. 
\v 3  \add I know that this is true\add*, because I have seen for myself that they not only gave
\add money\add* \\f + \\ft euphemism \\f* that they were able \add to give\add*, they gave
\add so much money that they did\add* not even keep enough \add to buy what they needed for
themselves\add*. Without anyone telling them \add to share their
possessions\add*, 
\v 4 they themselves kept requesting us to let them participate in what
\add other believers\add* are doing in \add sending a gift of money
to\add* \\f + \\ft euphemism \\f* God's people \add in Judea province\add*. 
\v 5 I thought \add that they would give only a little of their money,
but\add* they did much \add more than that\add*! First, they told the Lord
\add Jesus\add* that they wanted to do \add what pleases him. After that, they
told\add* me that they wanted to do \add whatever I thought was good for them to do, because they were sure
that\add* would be what God \add wanted them to do\add*. 
\v 6 So, because Titus was the one who \add helped you to\add* begin
\add gathering the money\add* [EUP, MTY] for your gift, I urged him to also
\add help you\add* to finish \add collecting the rest of\add* your generous and loving gift.
\v 7 You are doing very well in so many \add other\add* ways. \add God's Spirit enables you
to\add* believe that \add God\add* will \add do miracles. His Spirit has given you the ability
to\add* tell \add God's message to others. His Spirit makes you able
to\add* know things that he reveals to you. You eagerly \add want to help
people\add*, and you love us\add (exc)\add* very much. \add So now\add*, try to do well in getting your generous
\add gift of money\add* \\f + \\ft euphemism \\f* \add ready to send to the believers in Judea
province\add*. 
\p
\v 8 I am not commanding you \add to do this\add*. But \add because I have seen how believers
in\add* other \add places\add* are eager \add to help other believers who do not
have\add* ◄\add what they need\f + \ft Or: enough \f* to live on\add*►, I want you similarly to show that you love others sincerely.
\v 9 You already know \add how much\add* our Lord Jesus \add did for
you\add* that you did not deserve. Everything \add in heaven\add* belonged to him. But in order to benefit you,
\add he left all of those things behind and became a human being. Here on earth he
had\add* very few possessions \add of his own\add*. But because he became poor like that, he is
\add able to cause\add* you\add (pl)\add* to become \add spiritually\add* rich.
\v 10 So, \add as you think of our Lord's example, I will tell you\add* what I think that you should do in this matter
\add of giving money. As you know\add*, last year, because you desired
\add to give money to help God's people in Judea province\add*, you began
\add collecting money\add* \\f + \\ft euphemism \\f*. 
\v 11 So now you should finish \add collecting\add* the money \\f + \\ft euphemism \\f* that you began
\add to gather\add*. In that way, \add everyone will know that you are
just\add* as ready to finish \add collecting this gift\add* as you were to begin collecting it. Give what you are able to give.
\v 12  \add Keep in mind that\add* if you really want to \add give something to help
others\add*, whatever any one of you is \add able to give\add* will be pleasing
\add to God. God does not expect his people to give more\add* than they can afford to give.
\v 13 I do not mean that \add you should give so much to help others
that\add* you yourselves do not have what you need. No, what I want is that
\add both you and others\add* will have what\add you need\add*. 
\v 14 Right now, when you have ◄more \add than you need\f + \ft Or:  \f*\add*plenty► and
\add the believers in Judea\add* do not have ◄enough\f + \ft Or: all \f* that they need►,
\add with your gift you will enable them to have enough. Maybe some
day\add* when you do not have ◄enough\f + \ft Or: all \f* that you need► and they have more than they need, they will
\add be able to\add* help you. Then everyone will have enough \f + \ft (OR, In that way each will share alike).
\v 15  \add If that happens, the result will be like it is written\add*
{\add like someone\f + \ft Or: Moses \f*\add* wrote} \add in the Scriptures about the time when God provided manna for his
people\add*, 
\p If someone gathered a lot \add of manna\add*, he still did not have more than he needed,
\add because he gave some to someone who did not have enough\add*. And those who gathered only a little
\add manna\add* still had all that they needed \\f + \\ft litotes \\f*, \add because others who gathered more than they needed gave some manna to
them\add*. 
\s 2 Corinthians 8:16-9:5 
\s I am sending Titus to you, along with two other believers, to help you get your gift ready. They are all well respected and
trustworthy men, so treat them well. It will be good if you have your gift ready to send to Judea province by the time I arrive
in Corinth. 
\p
\v 16  \add So now I am sending Titus to visit you again\add*. God has caused him to be just as eager
\add to help you prepare your gift\add* as I am. I thank God for that.
\v 17  \add He is going there\add*, not only because we urged him to go, but because he himself is very eager
\add to visit you again\add*. 
\v 18 I am sending with Titus another believer \add whom you know
well\add*. All the groups of believers \add in this area\add* think highly of him because he has
\add faithfully taught\add* the good message \add about Christ\add*.
\v 19 Not only that, but he was appointed by the congregations \add in this
area\add* {the congregations \add in this area\add* appointed him} to
\add go\add* there with us\add (exc)\add*. He \add will go\add* with us
\add when we take\add* the generous gift of money \\f + \\ft euphemism \\f* \add to the believers in Jerusalem. We are taking
this\add* gift to honor the Lord \add Jesus\add* and to show them that we all
\add very much\add* want to \add help them\add*. 
\p
\v 20  \add The believers have\add* given money \\f + \\ft euphemism \\f* generously. So,
\add by sending that fellow believer along with Titus\add* to take the money
\add to Jerusalem\add*, we are trying to make sure that no one will be able to accuse
us\add (exc) of taking some of the money for ourselves\add*. 
\v 21  \add I say that\add* because we\add (exc)\add* want to make sure that the Lord
\add God\add* will see that what we\add (exc)\add* do is right, and other people will see it, too.
\v 22 Furthermore, there is also another believer \add here\add* whom we are sending
\add to you along with the two\add* men \add whom I have just mentioned\add*. Many times I have seen his good work
\add for the Lord\add*, and I know that he is eager \add to serve the
Lord\add*. Now, because he knows for sure that you \add want to give this gift the same as other believers
do\add*, he is even more eager than he was before \add to go with the two other
men\add*. 
\v 23 As for Titus, \add I have chosen him because\add* he is my partner, and he has worked faithfully with me
\add to help you\add*. As for the other two men, the congregations
\add in this area\add* are sending them as their messengers. These two men honor Christ
\add by everything they do\add*. 
\v 24 So then, show them that you truly love \add others\add*, and
\add in that way\add* help their congregations to understand \add why\add*
we\add (exc) \f*\add* are always saying such good things about you.
