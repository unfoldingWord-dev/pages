\v 1  \add I\add*, Paul, who \add write this letter to you\add*, became an apostle of Christ Jesus because God chose me for
that. \add Timothy, our\add* fellow believer, \add is with me. I am sending this
letter\add* to you who are God's people in the congregations in Corinth
\add city. I want\add* the believers who live in \add other places\add* in Achaia
\add province to also read this letter\add*. 
\v 2  \add We(exc) desire\add* that you will \add experience\add* God our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ
\add acting\add* kindly toward you and causing you to have \add inner\add* peace.
\s 2 Corinthians 1:3-11 
\s We thank God that he encourages us in all our troubles so that we are able to encourage you when you suffer. We suffered so
much in Asia province that we were sure that we were going to die, but we learned to trust in God. He saved us from death and
he will continue to save us. 
\p
\v 3  \add We should\add* praise God, who is the father of our\add (inc)\add* Lord Jesus Christ. He always pities us and helps
us \add because he is like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* a father to us \add and we are like his
children\add*. He always encourages us\add (inc)\add*. 
\v 4 He has encouraged us\add (exc)\add* whenever we suffered hardships. As a result,
we\add (exc)\add* are able to encourage others whenever they suffer hardships, just as\f + \ft Or: just \f* like God has encouraged
us\add (exc)\add*. 
\v 5 It is true that just like Christ suffered, we \add who serve
him\add* also continually suffer \add because we belong to him\add*. But also, because we
\add belong to\add* Christ, God greatly strengthens us just as\f + \ft Or: just like \f*
\add God strengthened him\add*. 
\v 6 So, whenever we\add (exc)\add* experience sufferings, we \add learn how to
encourage\add* you \add when you experience sufferings. As a result, you will become more and more the kind of people
God\add* wants you to be. Whenever \add God\add* strengthens us\add (exc) in our sufferings,
he\add* does that in order that you \add may see how he makes us strong when we are suffering. Then, as
God\add* encourages \add you in that way\add*, you will learn to continue patiently
\add trusting him\add* when you suffer as we do. 
\v 7 As a result, we\add (exc)\add* strongly expect that because you suffer just as\f + \ft Or: just \f* like we do,
\add God\add* will encourage you just as\f + \ft Or: just like \f* \add he\add* encourages us.
\p
\v 8  \add Our\add* fellow believers, we\add (exc)\add* want you to know \f + \ft litotes \f* about the trouble that we suffered in Asia
\add province\add*. That trouble was so very great that it was much more than we were able to endure. As a result,
we\add (exc)\add* thought that we would certainly die. 
\v 9 Indeed, we felt \add like a person feels when he has heard a judge
say\add*, "I condemn you to die\f + \ft Or: be \f* executed \f + \ft metaphor \f*." But \add God allowed us to think that we were going to
die\add* so that we would not rely on\f + \ft Or: trust in \f* our own \add strength. He wanted
us\add* instead\add to rely\add* only on his \add strength, because
he\add* is the one who \add has power even to make\add* those who have died live
\add again\add*. 
\v 10 And \add even though\add* we\add (exc)\add* were \add in terrible danger and
were\add* about to die, God rescued us. And he will continue to rescue
us\add whenever we are in trouble\add*. We confidently expect that he will continue to rescue us
\add time after time\add*. 
\v 11  \add And we are also relying on\add* you to help us by praying for
us\add (exc)\add*. \add If many people pray for us\add*, many people will also thank
\add God\add* when \add he\add* kindly answers those many prayers
\add and delivers us from danger\add*. 
\s 2 Corinthians 1:12-2:11 
\s You can trust what I tell you. I did not visit you, because I wanted to give you the opportunity to obey the instructions
that I wrote to you. Now that you have punished enough the man who caused those problems, I urge you to forgive him and to
encourage him. 
\p
\v 12 I am happy \add to say\add* that I have behaved toward all people \f + \ft metonymy \f* in an honest and sincere way. I am sure within
myself \add that this is true\add*. Especially, I have behaved toward you
\add honestly and sincerely because that is what\add* God wants us to do. As I have done that,
\add my thoughts\add* have not been the thoughts that unbelieving people \f + \ft metonymy \f*
\add think are\add* wise. Instead, \add I have behaved toward people only as God wants me to, depending
on\add* God to help me in ways that I do not deserve. 
\v 13  \add I say that\add* because \add in all my letters to you\add* I have always written \f + \ft litotes \f* clearly in a way that you
can easily and completely understand \add when you\add* read them.
\v 14  \add Previously some of\add* you, but not all of you, have completely understood
\add that I am always honest and sincere with you\add*. But I confidently expect that
\add soon\add* you will all be fully convinced \add about that\add*. Then when the Lord Jesus \f + \ft metonymy \f*
\add returns, you will all be able to say that\add* you are pleased with me, just like I will
\add be able to say that\add* I am pleased with you. 
\p
\v 15-16 It was because I felt sure \add that all of you were pleased with
me\add* that I was planning to visit you on my way from \add here\add* to Macedonia
\add province\add*. I also planned to visit you again on my way back from there, so that I could
\add spend time with you\add* twice, and be able to help you more, and I was hoping that you would
\add give me things that I needed\add* \f + \ft euphemism \f* for my journey to Judea
\add province\add*. 
\v 17 So then, even though I \add changed my mind later and did not do
what\add* I \add first\add* planned to do, \add it was not because I did not have an important reason for changing my
plans\add*. Surely you do not\add really think\add* that I decide on what I am going to do like people who do not know God
do!\f + \ft Or: Do you \add really think\add* that I decide on what I am going to do like people who do not know God do? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* I am
\add not like that\add*. I am not \add a person who\add* says \add to
people\add*, "Yes, \add certainly I will do that\add*," and then
\add for no good reason changes his mind and says\add*, "No, \add I will not do
it\add*." 
\v 18 Just as surely as God always does what he says \add he will do, it is true that I have never
said\add*, "Yes, \add I will do this\add*" when I \add really meant\add* "No."
\v 19  \add I follow the example of\add* God's Son, Jesus Christ. When I, along with Silas and Timothy, taught you
\add about Christ\add*, we told you that he was not \add someone who said that
he\add* would do \add something\add* and \add then\add* did not \add do
it\add*. Jesus Christ never \add said to anyone\add*, "Yes, \add I will do what you
desire\add*," and \add then did\add* not \add do it\add*. 
\v 20  \add We(inc) know that is true\add*, because everything that God promised to do
\add for his people\add*, he has done completely by \add sending\add* Christ
\add to save us\add*. That is why we say, "Yes, it is true! \add God has done everything that he promised to
do!\add*" And we praise him! 
\v 21 Now it is only God himself who causes us\add (exc)\add*, as well as you, to keep on
\add believing\add* strongly in Christ. God is the one who chose
us\add (inc) to belong to him and to have a close relationship\add* with Christ.
\v 22 He also sent his Holy Spirit into our\add (inc)\add* lives to mark us as belonging to himself \f + \ft metaphor \f*. Also, since he has
sent his Spirit to live inside of us\add (inc)\add*, \add he wants us to know by this
that\add* he guarantees \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add to give us every other\add* \add blessing\f + \ft Or: good
thing\add* \f* \add that he has promised\add*. 
\p
\v 23 So now \add I will tell you why I changed my mind and did not visit you as I intended to
do\add*: God himself knows \add that what I am telling you is true\add*. The reason that I did not return to Corinth was so
that I might not have to \add speak to you severely about the wrong that you had
done\add*. 
\v 24 It is not that Silas, Timothy and I want to boss you \add and tell you that you
must\add* believe only what we say. \add Not at all!\add* On the contrary,
we\add (exc)\add* are working as partners \add with you\add* in order to make you happy.
\add We do not try to force you to believe everything that we believe, because we are sure that you are continuing
to\add* trust \add the Lord Jesus Christ\add* and that you are remaining firmly committed to him.
