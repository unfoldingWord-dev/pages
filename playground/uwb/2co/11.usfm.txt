\v 1  \add But now, because my opponents are saying that Christ sent them to you as his representatives and that he did not
send me\add*, please be patient with me, too, \add while I say a\add* few things
\add that may sound as if\add* \\f + \\ft irony \\f* \add I am praising myself, like\add* a foolish person
\add would do. You have been\add* ◄\add putting up with\f + \ft Or: tolerating \f*\add*►
\add those who teach what is false;\add* now then, ◄put up with\f + \ft Or: tolerate \f*► me
\add too\add*. 
\v 2 I really do care about \add what happens to\add* you, just as God cares about
\add what happens to you. Just like a father wants his daughter to be sexually pure when he presents her to the man she will
marry\add* \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f*, I \add want you to belong\add* to Christ \add alone and to no
other\add*. I want to present you \add to him\add* as people who remain faithful to him
\add only, and who have not believed the deceitful message of those who are teaching what is
false\add*. 
\v 3 However, just like \add Satan, when he\add* cunningly \add appeared as
a\add* snake, deceived Eve's thinking \add and caused her to disobey the Lord
God\add*, I am concerned that \add those teachers\add* will cause you to think wrongly so that you will no longer
\add be faithful to\add* Christ alone. 
\v 4  \add I say that\add* because some people have come among you who are teaching
\add their own thoughts about\add* Jesus. They \add are saying about
him\add* things that are \add entirely\add* different from what I taught you.
\add They are urging\add* you to receive a \add powerful\add* spirit who
\add would come to live inside of you\add*, but it is not the same
\add Spirit\add* that you received \add from God when you believed in
Christ\add*. They preach \add what they call\add* a good message, and you accept
\add their message, even though it is not the same as the good message about Christ that you heard from me.
And\add* you have gladly accepted them and their message! 
\v 5 I consider that \\f + \\ft litotes \\f* none of those \add men, even though they think of themselves as
being\add* \\f + \\ft irony \\f* extra-special apostles, are in any way greater than I am.
\v 6  \add I admit that\add* I am not an eloquent speaker, but I do know
\add God's message\add*. I have made that clear to you by everything
\add that I have done among you and by all that I have taught you\add*.
\s 2 Corinthians 11:7-15 
\s You are mistaken if you think that I do not love you because I refused to accept money from you for my teaching. I will go
on doing that to prevent those false apostles among you from boasting that they work just as I do.
\p
\v 7  \add I refused to accept money\add* from you as pay for teaching you God's message about Christ. ◄It is ridiculous for
you to think that what I did was wrong!\f + \ft Or: Was \f* that wrong?► \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* \add I know that by teaching you without
pay\add*, I made myself seem \\f + \\ft irony \\f* unimportant to you. \add But I did
it\add* to honor you. 
\v 8  \add Some people might say that it was as though\add* \\f + \\ft irony \\f* I was robbing other congregations because I accepted money
from them in order that I might work among you. 
\v 9 Furthermore, when I was \add there\add* with you and had no
\add money to buy the things that I needed\add*, I did not cause any difficulty to any
\add of you\add* ◄\add by depending on you\f + \ft Or: by \f* asking you for money\f + \ft Or: support \f*\add*►, because
our\add (inc)\add* fellow believers who came from \add here in\add* Macedonia
\add province\add* brought enough \add money for me to buy everything\add* that I needed. So I have not caused you any
difficulty at all \add by asking you for money\add*, and I never will
\add ask you for money\add* \\f + \\ft euphemism \\f*. 
\v 10  \add And\add* as\add sure as you know that\add* everything that Christ says is true,
\add you can be sure that what\add* I say \add to you now is true. Wherever I
go\add* there in Achaia \add province\add*, \add I do not let you believers pay me for doing God's work among
you\add*. And no one will be able to prevent me from boasting \add about
that\add*. 
\v 11 No one should wrongly \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* think that it is because I do not love you that
\add I do not take pay from you\add*. God knows \add that you truly\f + \ft Or: really \f* are very dear to
me\add*. 
\p
\v 12 There are \add some men there among you\add* who would like to be able to say boastfully that they
\add work among you\add* just as I do. So, in order to make it impossible \\f + \\ft idiom \\f*
\add for them to say that\add*, I have \add refused to accept pay from
you\add*, and I will continue doing that. 
\v 13 Those men are lying \add when they say that they are\add* apostles. They work deceitfully.
\add Even though they say that they work for God, they are working only for
themselves\add*. They try to make people think that Christ \add sent
them\add* as his apostles, \add but they do not truly represent him\add*.
\v 14 I am not surprised \add that they act like that\add*, because Satan himself causes people to think
\add that he has come\add* as a shining messenger \add from God\add*.
\v 15 So it should not surprise \add you\add* if these men, who \add really\add* serve
\add Satan, do good deeds in order\add* to make you think they \add serve
God\add*. Some day God will \add punish them\add* according to what they deserve because of
their\add evil\add* deeds. 
\s 2 Corinthians 11:16-12:10 
\s You seem to listen to those who boast, so I too will boast. I will boast about being a Jew (as those others do), and I will
boast about having suffered greatly for Christ, and about an extraordinary vision that God gave me. Although God caused me to
suffer an affliction, he promised that he would help me and strengthen me.
\p
\v 16 I say again: I do not want anyone \add among you\add* to think that my
\add boasting about myself\add* is like foolish \add people\add* boast. But even if anyone
\add thinks that I am boasting about myself like a foolish person boasts, listen
to\add* what I \add have to say anyway, just like you listen to those false
apostles\add*. They really \add speak\add* foolishly! Listen to me while I also boast a little.
\v 17 About the things that I am \add going to tell you\add*, boasting confidently
\add about myself, surely you know that they are not the kind of
things\add* that the Lord \add Jesus\add* would say. Instead, \add I will
speak\add* as a foolish \add person would speak\add*. 
\v 18 Because many \add among you\add* are boasting \add about their own
work\add*, as unbelievers do, I will also boast \add about myself and my
work\add* [MTY, IRO]. 
\v 19  \add I am sure that you, who think that you are so wise, will accept what I
say\add* because you gladly \add accept the\add* false teachers and the foolish things
\add that they say\add*. 
\v 20 When people \add treat\add* you as if they were your bosses, you gladly submit
\add to them. You think that it is all right when others\add* force you provide for their needs. You think that it is all
right\add when people\add* take control over you, when they boast about themselves,
\add or when they insult you by\add* slapping you in the face. 
\v 21 I agree that I was not bold enough to treat you in such ways.
\add So do you think that\add* \\f + \\ft irony \\f* I should feel ashamed \add because I did not do
that?\add* 
\p So now, talking like a person who does not have any sense, I will boldly tell you
\add some things about myself, just like those false apostles tell you things about
themselves\add*. 
\v 22 Do \add they tell you\add* that they are Hebrews \add and can speak in the Hebrew
language?\add* Well, I can say the same thing \add about myself\add*. Do they
\add tell you that they\add* belong \add to God's people\add*, the nation of Israel? Well, I can say the same thing
\add about myself\add*. \add Do they tell you that\add* they are descendants of
\add our great\add* ancestor Abraham? Well, he is my ancestor, too.
\v 23  \add Do they tell you how much\add* work they have done for Christ? Now I am talking like a crazy person talks \\f + \\ft euphemism \\f*.
Well, I work for Christ much more \add than they do. I have been\add* in prison many more times
\add than they have. Many times I\add* have been beaten {\add people\add* have beaten me} very severely
\add because I believe in and obey Christ\add*. Many times I almost died
\add because of serving Christ\add*. 
\v 24 On five occasions Jewish \add religious leaders\add* beat me 39 times with a whip.
\v 25 On three occasions I was beaten {\add Roman\add* officials beat me} with wooden sticks. On one occasion
\add a large crowd of people\add* threw stones at me \add to kill
me\add*. On three occasions the ship \add that I was traveling in\add* was wrecked
\add and sank. On one of those occasions\add* I was \add floating\add* in the water a night and a day
\add before I was rescued\add*. 
\v 26 As I have often traveled to other places, \add I have often risked losing my life. For
example\add*, sometimes I have been in danger \add crossing\add* rivers.
\add I have been\add* in danger \add traveling in places\add* where there were
bandits\add . At times I have been in\add* danger among people of my own nation,
\add the Jews\add*, and \add at other times I been in\add* danger among those who are not Jews.
\add I have been\add* in danger in cities, and I have been in dangerous situations in barren areas. I have been in dangerous
situations \add when I was traveling in ships\add*. \add I have been
in\add* danger among people who falsely \add claim to be\add* fellow believers.
\v 27 I have worked very hard \\f + \\ft doublet \\f* \add to earn\add* ◄\add a living\f + \ft Or: what \f* I
need\add*►, and often I did not sleep. At times I was hungry and thirsty, and at times I did not have enough time to eat.
Sometimes I was cold \add because\add* I did not have enough clothes
\add to wear\add*. 
\v 28 In addition to all that, I am constantly and deeply concerned about all the congregations
\add that I have helped to begin\add*. 
\v 29  \add Every time that I hear about fellow believers\add* \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* who are not strong
\add spiritually\add*, I sympathize with them \add and try to help them. Every time that I learn about a fellow
believer\add* \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* who causes \add another believer\add* to do something wrong, that makes me very angry.
\p
\v 30 Because \add it seems that\add* it is necessary for me to \add continue\add* boasting
\add about myself\add*, I will boast about things that \add caused some people to think of
me\add* as being weak. 
\v 31 God, who is the Father of our\add (inc)\add* Lord Jesus, and who is the one
\add whom we should\add* praise forever, knows that I am not lying
\add about this\add*. 
\v 32  \add One time when I was\add* in Damascus \add city\add*, the governor whom King Aretas
\add had appointed\add* to rule \add part of his area told his soldiers\add* to guard
\add the gates of\add* the city so that they could seize me \add if I tried to leave the
city\add*. 
\v 33 But \add my friends\add* enabled me to escape \add by\add* putting me in a large basket and lowering me
\add to the ground by a rope\add* through an opening in the \add city\add* wall.
\add That was really humiliating!\add*
