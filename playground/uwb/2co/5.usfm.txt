\c 5  
\s 2 Corinthians 5:1-10 
\s God will give all of us new heavenly bodies, and he will reward us according to what we did while we were living in our
earthly bodies. 
\p
\v 1 We know that \add these bodies\add* we live in \add here in this world are
like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* tents. \add They are like temporary living\f + \ft Or: dwelling \f*
places\add*. \add So we should not be concerned about what happens to our
bodies\add*. We know that if we are killed {if \add someone\add* kills us}, God will give us
\add permanent living places. Those permanent living places\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* will not be houses that people have made. They
\add will be new bodies in which we will live forever\add* in heaven.
\v 2  \add While we are here on earth, we suffer\add*. We often groan because we desire
\add to go\add* to heaven \add where God\add* will give us our new
\add bodies\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. 
\v 3 When \add God gives us(inc) our new bodies\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, our \add spirits will
have\add* \f + \ft litotes, metaphor \f* bodies to live in \add that will last forever\add*.
\p
\v 4  \add It is true that\add* while we are still living in these bodies \f + \ft metaphor \f*
\add that do not last forever\add*, we often groan \f + \ft doublet \f* \add because we desire to be free from
them\add*. We are not longing to be without a body. Instead, \add we groan
because\add* we desire to receive our new bodies \f + \ft metaphor \f* in heaven. We long for this to happen so that these bodies that are
going to die some day will suddenly be changed \add into bodies\add* that will live
\add forever\add*. 
\v 5 It is God himself who has prepared us to \add receive\add* these
\add new bodies\add*. He is also the one who has guaranteed\f + \ft Or: assured \f*
us\add (inc)\add* that this will happen. He has guaranteed it by sending his Spirit
\add to live inside us now\add*. 
\p
\v 6 So, \add because God's Spirit lives in us\add*, we are always confident
\add that God will give us new bodies\add*. We know that as long as we live in our bodies here on
\add earth\add*, we are not yet \add living together\add* with the Lord
\add Jesus in heaven\add*. 
\v 7 While we\add (exc)\add* live \add here, we\add* do not have our
\add new bodies, but we are\add* trusting \add that God will give them to
us\add*. 
\v 8  \add As I said\add*, we\add (exc)\add* are confident \add that he will give us new
bodies\add*. We\add (exc)\add* would much prefer to leave these bodies
\add in which we are now living\add*, and be with the Lord \add Jesus in
our\add* home in \add heaven\add*. 
\v 9 Because of all that, we always want to please \add Jesus in everything that we
do\add*. Whether we\add (exc)\add* are \add still living\add* here
\add in these\add* bodies or whether we have \add left\add* them and are living in our home
\add in heaven\add*, we want to please him. 
\v 10  \add And we need to try hard to do that\add* because each one of us
\add believers\add* must stand before Christ \add to be\add* judged\add by
him\add* {\add when he will\add* judge \add his people\add*}. \add At that
time\add* he will \add reward each one of\add* us according to what we have done
\add while we lived in this world\add* in these bodies. \add He will reward us according
to\add* whether we have done good or whether we have done evil. 
\s 2 Corinthians 5:11-6:2 
\s Christ has shown me how much he loves people. That is why I teach his message with all the strength that I have. Therefore,
I plead with you to believe that God will forgive you because of what Christ did for you.
\p
\v 11 It makes me fearful \add to think that some day I will stand before the Lord for him to judge
me\add*. So I \add do everything that I can to\add* convince people
\add that they should believe\add* \f + \ft Or: \add that I teach\add* sincerely \f*
\add God's message\add*. God knows very well \add how I conduct my life and what I
teach\add*, and I really believe that you also know it, within yourselves.
\v 12 Once again \add I say, as I write this\add*, I am not just
\add trying to\add* make you think well\f + \ft Or: highly \f* of me, \add as some people will probably say that I
am\add*. Instead, I am \add telling you in this letter why you have\add* good reason
\add to tell those who criticize me\add* that you think highly of me.
\add I am telling you this\add* so that you will know what to say to those
\add teachers of false doctrine among you\add*. They are proud \add of what they have
done\add*, instead of \add making sure that\add* their hearts\add are right with God and being pleased with
that\add*. 
\v 13  \add Some of them say that after God has enabled me to see
visions\add*, I \add talk like\add* a crazy person. If \add that is so, I want you to realize that I talk that way in order to
please\add* God. On the other hand, if \add you think that\add* I
\add speak and act\add* wisely, \add that is good. I want you to know that I
do\add* that in order to \add help\add* you. 
\v 14  \add I speak and act the way I do\add* because the love that Christ
\add has for people\add* influences me \add in everything that I say and
do\add*. When he died, \add he suffered the punishment\add* for \add the sins
of\add* all people. So, we should all \add think of ourselves as
having\add* died with him, \add being as unresponsive to sinful desires
as\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* a corpse is. 
\v 15 When \add Christ\add* died for the sake of all people, he died in order that
\add we believers who are alive now\add* should not conduct our lives in a way that will just
\add please ourselves\add*. Instead, \add we should conduct our lives in a way that will
please\add* him, \add because\add* he is the one who died for us and was raised {whom
\add God\add* raised} to life again. 
\p
\v 16 So, \add because I realize how much Christ loves all people\add*, I no longer think about people in the way that those
who do not believe \add in Christ\add* think about \add them\add*. Before I
\add was a believer\add*, I thought about Christ in the way that other non-believers did. But I do not think of him that way
anymore. 
\v 17 The fact is that God makes every one \add of us\add* who \add trusts\add* in Christ to be completely different
\add than we were before\add*. Our old \add way of conducting our
lives\add* is gone. We now have a \add completely\add* new way of
\add conducting our lives\add*. 
\v 18 This \add complete change in our lives\add* is all something that God
\add does\add*. It is God who made it possible for us to have a peaceful relationship with him.
\add He was able to do that\add* because of what Christ \add did for
us\add*. Now God \add has sent\add* me, and those \add who work\add* with me, to tell
\add people that they\add* can have a peaceful relationship with him.
\v 19 That is, \add he sent us(exc) to tell them that\add* when Christ
\add died\add*, God was \add making it possible for all the people
of\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* the world to have a peaceful relationship with him. He no longer keeps a record of the sinful things that
\add we believers\add* have done. The message that \add God\add* has given to us
\add to tell people is how we can have a\add* peaceful relationship with him.
\v 20 So, it is I and my companions who are Christ's representatives
\add in this world. When we tell people the message about Christ\add*, it is God himself who is pleading with them by means of
what we \add say\add*. So, as true representatives of Christ, we plead with you:
\add Believe God's true message about Christ in order that you may\add* be reconciled to {have a peaceful relationship with}
him. 
\v 21  \add You must believe that even though\add* Jesus never sinned, God
\add punished him for all the\add* sinful things \add that people do,
just\add* as \add if Jesus had done those sinful things himself\add*. And because of our close relationship with Christ, God
has erased the record of our sins\f + \ft Or: declared \f* us no longer guilty for our sins.
