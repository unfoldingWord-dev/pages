\c 10  
\s 2 Corinthians 10:1-6 
\s I Paul say to you, “Do not listen to those who say that I am afraid to rebuke you when I am with you and that I behave like
people do who are not believers.” 
\p
\v 1 Now I myself, Paul, appeal to you in a gentle and humble way, like Christ
\add would. Certain people among you have falsely accused me by saying\add*, “When
\add Paul\add* is with you, he is humble \add and speaks gently\add* to you, but when he is away from you,
\add in the letters he writes to you\add* he threatens \add to punish\add* you.”
\add Those people claim that I do not have authority over you as an
apostle\add*. 
\v 2 I strongly plead with you, “\add Please do not listen to people who say things like
that!\add*” \add I strongly plead with you to not listen to them\add*, so that when I am there
\add with you\add* I will not \add need to\add* speak severely \add to
you\add* in the same severe way as I \add plan to\add* speak to those people who think that I behave like people who are not
believers. 
\v 3  \add Remember that\add* although I am \add human like everyone
else\add* in the world, I do not fight \add against those who oppose
me\add* in the way that people who are not believers fight those who oppose them.
\v 4  \add I will tell you what I mean by that: Just like soldiers
use\add* various weapons \add to fight their enemies\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*,
\add I\add* \add fight against\f + \ft Or: oppose\add* \f* \add those who\add* oppose God's message, but I do it in a different way. I do not
\add use human arguments and clever\f + \ft Or: sweet \f* talk\add*, like unbelievers do. Instead,
\add I fight against my opponents\add* by the powerful means that God
\add has given me\add*. With that power \add I destroy their arguments against God's message and against me, just like soldiers
destroy\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* the fortresses \add of their enemies\add*. 
\v 5  \add Specifically\add*, I show that the \add human\add* arguments that they use to deceive
\add people are completely wrong\add*. When they \add proudly say things
that\add* keep other people from knowing God, \add I show them that they are completely wrong. I also enable people
to\add* change their ways of thinking so that they think about everything as Christ
\add wants them to think\add*. 
\v 6 I am also ready to discipline everyone \add among you\add* who has not obeyed
\add the things that Christ taught. I will do this\add* as soon as you
\add who truly want to obey Christ show me that\add* you are \add going
to\add* obey him completely. 
\s 2 Corinthians 10:7-11:6 
\s Those who teach what is false must come to realize that I also belong to Christ and that God has given me authority over
you. I worry that they will deceive you and that you will stop being faithful to Christ alone.
\p
\v 7  \add I want you to understand what is\add* happening among you. There are certain
\add people there who are telling you that\add* they know for sure that they are Christ's
\add representatives and that I am not\add*. Those people should realize that I
\add represent\add* Christ as much as they do. 
\v 8  \add I say that\add* because the authority that the Lord gave me
\add as his apostle\add* is to help you to become mature believers, not to cause you to stop
\add trusting in Christ\add*. So even if I were to boast a little more than I have
\add already done\add* \f + \ft Or: proudly talk a little more than I have
\add already talked\add* about the authority the Lord gave me \add as his
apostle\add* \f*, \add no one would be able to make me\add* ashamed
\add by proving that Jesus has not given me that authority\add*.
\v 9 I do not intend to make you afraid of me by the letters that I
\add write to you\add*. 
\v 10  \add I say that\add* because some people are saying, “\add When Paul
writes\add* letters, he says severe things \add in order to make you obey
him\add*, but when he is here with you, \add people look at him and
say\add* he is weak, and he certainly is not a skillful speaker.”
\v 11 The \add people who say\add* such things should think carefully about this: The kind of
\add severe\add* person that \add you think\add* me to be when you read my letters is exactly the kind of person I will be when
I come. \add I will do what I wrote that I would do\add*. 
\p
\v 12  \add Those who oppose me\add* tell others how good they are.
\add If they really were superior to me\add* \f + \ft irony \f*, I would not be so bold as to say that I
\add was equal to them, or\add* to compare myself with them\add . But they are not superior to
me\add*. They make up their own standards \add about what God's servants should be
like\add*, and then they look at their own \add conduct\add* and decide
\add whether or not they meet those standards. By doing that, they show
that\add* they are foolish. 
\v 13 But as for me, I will not boast about \add working among people living
in\add* areas outside of the areas \add that God sent\f + \ft Or: assigned \f* me to work
in\add*. But \add it is right for\add* me to say that \add I have
worked\add* in the areas that God assigned to me. \add And since those
areas\add* include the one where you live, 
\v 14  \add when I talk about working among you\add*, I am not boasting
\add about working in an area where God did not give me the right to work. What those who oppose me say about my not having
authority as an apostle to you might be true\add* if I had not already come all the way to your area.
\add But that is not true\add*, because I was the one who first brought the message about Christ to you.
\add I came to Corinth before they did\add*! 
\p
\v 15 Also, \add my opponents\add* boast about work that others have done
\add as if it were their own work\add*. It is improper for them to do that, but I do not do as they do. I confidently expect
that as you trust more and more \add in the good message that I preach\add*, you will more and more
\add agree that God has given me the right to\add* work \add as Christ's
representative\add* among you. 
\v 16 Then I will be able to go to places beyond where you \add are\add*. I will be able to tell the good message about Christ
\add to people in areas where no one has yet gone to tell that message\add*. And
\add I will be able to talk about the work I myself have done in that
area\add*, instead of boasting about work that someone else has already done
\add as if it were my work\add*. 
\v 17  \add I try to do according to what someone\f + \ft Or: Jeremiah \f* wrote in the
Scriptures\add*, 
\q If anyone wants to boast \add about something\add*, he should boast
\add only\add* about what the Lord \add God has done\add*. 
\p
\v 18  \add You can realize, then, that\add* it is not those who praise themselves\f + \ft Or: tell you what great things they have done \f*,
\add as my opponents do\add*, whom you should accept \add as apostles\add*. Instead, you
\add should accept as true apostles only\add* those whom the Lord commends.
