\c 13  
\p
\v 1  \add In the Scriptures it is stated that when one person\add* accuses
\add another of wrongdoing, you must not believe his\add* accusation
\add right away\add*. \add First, you must listen to at least\add* two or three people who actually saw what happened.
\add So keep in mind that\add* this will be the third time that I will visit you!
\v 2 When I visited you the second time, I warned you \add that I was going to punish all the wrongdoers among
you\add*. \add And now\add* I am \add warning you\add* again while I am still away
\add from you\add*. When I visit you this third time, I will punish those who were sinning
\add at the time when I visited you\add* before \add and who are still
sinning\add*, and I will \add punish\add* the others \add who have been sinning since then, if they have not turned away from
their sinful behavior\add*. 
\v 3 Because you have demanded that I prove to you that Christ is speaking
\add to you when\add* I \add speak to you, I will show you that I speak to you as his apostle.
Christ\add* does not approve of your sinful behavior. On the contrary, he will powerfully
\add discipline you\add*. 
\v 4  \add It is true that\add* Christ \add seemed to be\add* weak when he was crucified {when
\add people\add* killed him by nailing him to the cross}. But \add it is also true
that\add* he \add now\add* lives because God \add worked\add* powerfully
\add to make him alive again. Similarly\add*, as I \add serve\add* God, I also am a weak human
\add being as Christ was\add*. But I am also \add have a close relationship
with\add* Christ \add who is now alive again\add*. And with his \add authority\add* I will use God's power
\add to discipline\add* you. 
\p
\v 5 Each of you should ask yourself: “\add Do I\add* believe \add God's message about
Christ?\add*” Each of you should \add test yourselves to\add* make sure that you truly do
\add believe\add* in Christ \add and thus truly belong to him\add*, and
that\add his Spirit lives\add* within you\add (pl)\add*. When you test yourselves
\add in that way\add*, I am sure that you will \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* say \add to
me\add*, “Yes, of course we \add belong to\add* Christ.” 
\v 6 I am \add also\add* certain that you will know that I \add belong to Christ, just like you
do\add*. 
\v 7 But \add because I do not want to have to punish you\add*, I am praying to God that he will help you not to do anything
evil \add that would cause me to have to punish you. I pray this\add*, not in order that when people
\add who say that I am not your apostle\add* realize \add that my ministry among you has been very successful, they will have
to agree\add* that I do have authority from Christ. Instead, \add I pray this because I
want\add* you to do what is right, even though that might mean that
\add my opponents would think\add* that I do not have authority from Christ,
\add since I would not have an opportunity to show my authority to discipline
you\add*. 
\v 8  \add If you do what is right, I will not discipline you\add*,
\add because it would\add* not\add be right for me to do that if you are conducting your lives the way you should,
like\add* God's true \add message says that you should. What God asks me to do is to help people to know and obey
his\add* true \add message\add*. 
\v 9 I am happy \add whenever\add* you are strongly \add trusting and obeying Christ, and because of that I do not have to use
my authority to discipline you. It does not matter to me if that makes people think that I do not have any
authority\add*. Truly, what I am praying for is that \add God\add* will
\add help\add* you to completely change your conduct. 
\v 10 That is why I am writing these things while I am still away from you.
\add What I want is that\add* when I visit you, \add you will already be conducting your lives as God wants you
to\add*, and so I will not have to \add discipline you\add* severely, as the
\add Lord Jesus Christ gave me\add* the authority to do. The authority that I have from the Lord is to help you to become
\add spiritually\add* mature believers, not to cause you to stop
\add trusting in him\add*. 
\s 2 Corinthians 13:11-14 
\s I finish my letter with some advice. All of us here send you our greetings, and I pray that God will bless you.
\p
\v 11 Finally, my fellow believers, \add I say to you\add*, rejoice. Completely
\add change how you conduct your lives\add*, and do what I have urged you
\add to do\add*. Be united in what you think \add about the matters about which I have written to
you\add*. Live peacefully \add with each other. If you do those things\add*, God, who
\add enables you to\add* love \add each other\add* and be peaceful, will bless \f + \ft metonymy \f* you.
\v 12 Greet each other affectionately as \add fellow members\add* of God's family
\add should\add*. 
\v 13 All God's people \add here\add* send you greetings. 
\v 14  \add I pray that\add* the Lord Jesus Christ will act kindly
\add toward\add* all of you, in ways that you do not deserve, that God will
\add show all of you how much he\add* loves you, and that the Holy Spirit
\add will cause you to have good\add* fellowship \add with him and with each
other\add*.
