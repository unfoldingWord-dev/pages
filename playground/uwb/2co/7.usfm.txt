\c 7  
\p
\v 1 My friends, whom I love, because \add God\add* has promised like this
\add to accept us(inc) as his children\add*, we\add (inc)\add* must stop doing anything that is sinful. We must not do sinful
things with our bodies, and we must not \add think\add* sinful thoughts.
\add Because\add* we greatly revere God, we must strive to \add live\add* a completely pure life. By doing that we will become
the kind of people that he wants us to be. 
\s 2 Corinthians 7:2-4 
\s I love you all and I have great confidence in you. 
\p
\v 2 So, as I just wrote, I want you to love me (OR, us \f + \fr idiom \f* \add who are true apostles of
Christ\add*). I/we\add (exc)\add* have never done anything wrong to any of you. I/we have not done anything to harm any one of
you spiritually or financially. Nor have I/we tried to get money from
\add you\add* ◄for myself/for ourselves►. 
\v 3  \add It is true that some people among you have said that I have done such things.
Nevertheless\add*, I am not trying to make you all feel ashamed because, as I wrote before, I will continue to love you all
very much \f + \fr idiom \f*, whether I live with you or die with you. I am very confident about you.
\v 4 I am very pleased with you. You have greatly encouraged me, so that I am now very happy in spite of all the hardships that
I have endured. 
\s 2 Corinthians 7:5-16 
\s Titus told me that my letter caused you to repent, and so now I am very happy.
\p
\v 5 Now \add I will write more about what I was saying about Titus\add*. When I
\add left Troas and\add* came \add here to\add* Macedonia \add province\add*, I still did not get rest for my body. Everywhere
we\add (exc)\add* went, \add people were constantly\add* causing us trouble.
\add And not only were\add* people \add constantly causing us\add* trouble, but I was greatly concerned
\add about you all\add*. 
\v 6 But God, who always encourages his people when they are discouraged, encouraged us by
\add sending\add* Titus back to us. 
\v 7 I was encouraged by\add seeing\add* Titus\add , but when I heard
how\add* you had encouraged him, that encouraged me even more. He told me how much you wanted
\add to see me. He told me\add* that you were very sorry \add that you had made me so unhappy. He also told
me\add* that you are very eager for me \add to continue to serve as your apostle. When Titus told me those
things\add*, I was very, very happy. 
\p
\v 8 Even though what \add I wrote\add* in my letter ◄distressed you/made you sad►, I am not sorry
\add that I wrote it\add*. For a while I was sorry that I had written it,
\add because I knew that it would distress you\add*. Now \add Titus has also
told\add* me that it did distress you \add when you read it\add*, but you were distressed only for a short time.
\v 9  \add So now\add* I am happy \add that I wrote it\add*. I am not happy that you were distressed {that
\add I\add* distressed you}, but \add I am happy\add* because, when you became distressed, you became sorry for what you had
done and \add you asked God to forgive you. What I mean is that you became sorry in the way that God wanted you to be sorry, so
my making\add* you sorry did not harm you at all. 
\v 10  \add The fact is that\add* when God causes \add us to be\add* truly sorry for having sinned and we turn from our sinful
behavior, then God saves us \add and will not punish us for the sinful things that we have
done\add*. And no one is ever sorry about that. \add However\add*, the people who do not trust
\add in God\add* \f + \fr metonymy \f* may be sorry \add for the sinful things that they have
done\add*. But \add if they do not turn from their sinful behavior and ask God to forgive
them\add*, they will remain separated from him forever. 
\v 11 But \add think about what happened when you read my letter\add*. God caused you to be truly sorry
\add for what you had done\add*. You eagerly \add wanted to do what was
right\add*, and you wanted to show \add God\add* (OR\add , me\add*) that you had done the right thing. You were angry
\add about what had happened\add*, and you were worried \add that God would punish you if the situation
continued\add*. You also wanted me \add to visit you to encourage and help
you\add*. You wanted me to know \add that you really do accept me as your apostle, and that you punished the man who had sinned
as I told you to do. By doing\add* all of those things, you have shown
\add me\add* that you have done what is right in this matter. 
\v 12 So, even though I wrote that \add severe\add* letter to you, I did not
\add write it just\add* so that \add you would punish\add* the man who had done what was wrong. Also, I
\add did not write it\add* for the benefit of the person whom \add he\add* had wronged. Instead,
\add I wrote it\add* so that, when you \add read the letter\add*, God would enable you to realize how much you really do
respect \add my authority\add*. 
\v 13 So, \add because you listened to me and did what I asked you to
do\add*, ◄I was/we\add (exc)\add* were all► encouraged. Not only ◄was I/were we► encouraged, but ◄I
was/we\add (exc)\add* were► \add also\add* very happy to see how happy Titus was
\add when he arrived here. He told me/us that\add* he did not need to worry anymore, because
\add he saw\add* that you all \add had a good attitude toward me\add*.
\v 14 I had told Titus that I was pleased about you. And I did not need to be ashamed
\add for having boasted about you like that, because you did what I knew that you would
do\add*. Just like everything that I have taught you \add and written to
you\add* has been the truth, just as the good things that I told Titus about you were also true.
\v 15 Now he thinks \add back\add* happily on how you all \add were willing
to\add* do \add what I asked you to do\add*. He is \add also happy about the way
you\add* treated him with great respect. \add When he thinks about those
things\add*, \add it makes\add* him love you even more \add than he did when he was with
you\add*. 
\v 16  \add As for me\add*, I am very happy \add because now\add* I am certain that I can depend on you
\add to do what you know God wants you to do\add*.
