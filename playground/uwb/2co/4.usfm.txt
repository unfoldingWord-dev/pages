\c 4  
\s 2 Corinthians 4:1-6 
\s We are servants of Jesus. It is Jesus who has shown us how great God is.
\p
\v 1 So, because God has acted so kindly \add toward me\add* enabling
\add me to teach\add* this great \add message to people\add*, I never get
\add so\add* discouraged \add that I stop teaching it\add*. 
\v 2 And I have determined that we\add (exc)\add* will be honest \f + \fr litotes \f* in everything that we do. We will not
\add do anything that would cause\add* us to be ashamed \add if people found out about
it\add*. We never try to deceive \add you with clever arguments, as some other people
do\add*. We never \add try to deceive you\add* by changing God's message,
\add as those same people do\add*. Instead, we always teach \add people
only\add* the truth \add about Christ\add*, and we teach it clearly. Knowing that God is watching what we do, we
\add teach his message in an honest way, with the result that\add* no one can
\add accuse\add* us\add (exc) of being deceitful\add*. 
\v 3 And if, \add as some of you say, some people are\add* not able to understand the message
\add that we teach about Christ, it is not because we do not teach it
clearly\add*. It is because those people \add do not want to believe
it\add*. They are on the road to eternal death. 
\v 4  \add Satan, who is\add* the one \add who rules\add* this world, controls the thoughts of those unbelievers. He prevents
them from understanding the message about how wonderful Christ is.
\add They are not able to understand that\add* Jesus is like God
\add in every way\add*. 
\v 5 That is why, \add when we(exc) teach people\add*, we do not boast about ourselves,
\add as some people say that we do\add*. Instead, \add we teach you\add* that Jesus Christ is our Lord. We ourselves are
\add only\add* your servants. \add We want to honor and obey\add* Jesus.
\v 6 When God \add created the world\add*, he commanded the light to shine
\add where there was nothing but\add* darkness. He is the one who has
\add made his message about Jesus to be like\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f* a light shining into
our\add (inc)\add* minds. \add God\add* has done that \add for all of us who believe in Jesus. He has done that so that we will
understand that when people saw\add* Christ, they saw how awesome God himself was.
\s 2 Corinthians 4:7-15 
\s As Jesus' servants we suffer, but through our suffering many people will receive eternal life and thank and praise God.
\p
\v 7  \add This work that God has given to\add* us\add (exc)\add* is \f + \fr metaphor \f*
\add like\add* a very valuable treasure. But we who have that treasure
\add are as weak as fragile\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f* clay pots. \add God has planned it like
that\add* in order that \add people\add* will know that the power
\add that changes lives\add* is God's power, and not any power of our own.
\v 8 We are continually oppressed {\add People\add* continually oppress us} in many ways, but
\add we have\add* not been prevented {\add God has\add* not \add allowed them
to\add* prevent us} \add from teaching the message about Jesus Christ\add*. We often do not know what to do
\add in difficult situations\add*, but we never say, “God has abandoned us.”
\v 9  \add We are frequently\add* persecuted {\add People frequently\add* cause us to suffer}, but
\add God\add* never leaves us alone. \add Sometimes we are\add* badly wounded
{\add people\add* badly wound us}, but \add God does\add* not \add allow\add*
us\add to\add* be killed {\add them to\add* kill us}. 
\v 10  \add Wherever we(exc) go\add*, we continually \add realize that because people
killed\add* Jesus, \add people may\add* kill us \add for teaching his message. But we are willing to go on living this
way\add* in order that \add people\add* will know that Jesus is alive and
\add that he is directing\add* us \f + \fr synecdoche \f*. 
\v 11  \add So, although\add* we are \add still\add* alive, we always realize that we may be killed {that
\add people some day\add* may kill us} because \add we teach about\add* Jesus.
\add God allows us to suffer\add* in order that \add people\add* will see that Jesus is alive and that he is
\add strengthening\add* our bodies that are some day going to die.
\v 12 So \add I conclude that although\add* we \add apostles\add* are constantly
\add suffering and may soon\add* die, \add the result of that is that all
of\add* you \add have now received eternal\add* life. 
\p
\v 13 We are not discouraged. We are like \add the person who\add* wrote
\add in the Scriptures\add*, “\add God\add*, I trusted \add in you\add* and so I continue speaking
\add your message\add*.” We\add (exc)\add* also trust \add in God\add*, so we continue speaking
\add his message\add*. 
\v 14  \add We do this\add* because we\add (exc)\add* know that \add although people might kill us,
God\add*, who caused the Lord Jesus to live again after he died, will also cause
us\add (exc)\add* to live again \add after we die. God will do this because we belong
to\add* Jesus. \add And then God\add* will bring us\add (exc)\add*, together with you, to be with him.
\v 15  \add So I say that\add* all these things \add that we(exc)
suffer\add* are in order to help you. \add We have suffered all this\add* in order that more and more people,
\add as a result of hearing that God will\add* kindly/freely \add forgive their
sins\add*, will thank \add him and praise him. Then\add* they will greatly honor him
\add and worship him\add*. 
\s 2 Corinthians 4:16-18 
\s As our bodies get weaker, God continually makes our inner lives stronger. He will reward us for all that we have suffered.
\p
\v 16 So, \add because we know that as a result of our suffering many people will honor
God\add*, we\add (exc)\add* never get so discouraged \add that we stop teaching his
message\add*. Although our bodies are getting weaker, \add God\add* encourages us every day and strengthens us in our inner
beings/hearts. 
\v 17  \add I know that\add* all these troubles that \add happen to us in this life
are\add* not significant and will not last forever. \add When we think
of\add* the glorious things \add that God is preparing\add* for us
\add to enjoy\add* forever \add in heaven\add*, all \add our suffering
now\add* is not important. 
\v 18 That is why we say, “We will not continue thinking about \add all the suffering that
we\add* are experiencing now. Even though \add we\add* cannot see
\add all the things that God has prepared for us in heaven\add*, those are what we should be thinking about.”
\add That is how we should think\add*, because \add all these troubles\add* that
\add we(exc)\add* have \add now\add* will last only a short time. But what
\add we will have in heaven\add*, what \add we\add* cannot see \add now\add*, will last forever.
