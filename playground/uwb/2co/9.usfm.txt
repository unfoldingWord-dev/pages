\c 9  
\s 2 Corinthians 9:1-5 
\s You and I will be ashamed if your gift is not ready when I arrive.
\p
\v 1 Now \add I want to write\add* more about the gift \add of money\add* \f + \ft euphemism \f* that
\add you and other believers are preparing to send\add* to the believers
\add in Judea province\add*. I do not \add really\add* need to \add continue writing to you about
it\add*, 
\v 2 because I already know that you really want to help them. In fact, I have been boasting
\add about you\add*, telling the \add believers here in\add* Macedonia
\add province\add* that \add you people in\add* Achaia \add province\add* have been ready to help, beginning from last year. As
a result, because you are very eager to help \add the believers in Judea
province\add*, you have made most of \add the believers here in Macedonia province also
want\add* to give \add a gift\add*. 
\v 3 However, I am sending Titus and the other two believers in order that
\add they will be able to help you finish collecting the money. Then when I and others arrive later, the people with me will
see for themselves that\add* the things that I have been boasting about you are true \f + \ft litotes \f*.
\add I want\add* you \add to have your gift\add* ready \add for us(exc) to take to
Jerusalem\add*, just like I have been telling them that you were ready.
\v 4 When I come, if any of \add the believers from\add* Macedonia come with me,
\add I do not want them to find that your gift is\add* [MTY, EUP] not ready. If that were
\add to happen\add*, I would be very ashamed, and you yourselves would be even more ashamed.
\v 5 So that is why I felt that it was necessary to urge these \add three\add* believers to go
\add and visit\add* you before I \add come. In that way, they would be able to help you to
finish\add* collecting the generous gift \f + \ft euphemism \f* that had been promised by you {you had said you would give}.
\add If you do that, not only will\add* the gift be ready \add by the time that we arrive, but everyone will see that you have
given because you really want to give, and\add* not because anyone has forced you to give.
\s 2 Corinthians 9:6-15 
\s If you give generously and willingly, God will always continue to bless you so that you will have enough to continue giving
generously, and your generosity will cause many other people to praise and honor God.
\p
\v 6 Do not forget this: “\add A farmer\add* who sows only a few
\add seeds\add* will not gather\f + \ft Or: reap \f* a large \add harvest\add*, but the one who sows a lot
\add of seeds\add* will gather\f + \ft Or: reap \f* a large \add harvest\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*.”
\add Similarly, if you give just a little to help others, God will give you only a few blessings. But if you give willingly and
cheerfully to help people, you will receive in return many blessings from
God\add*. 
\v 7 Each of you should decide within yourself how much you\add (sg)\add* should give,
\add and then give that amount\add*. You\add (sg)\add* should not
\add be thinking to yourself\add*, “\add I really\add* do not want to give this money.”
\add And you(sg) should\add* not give \add just\add* because someone tells
\add you to give. Instead, you should give willingly and cheerfully\add*, because God loves those who give cheerfully.
\v 8 Moreover, God can enable you to \add give to others cheerfully. If you give that
way\add*, God will \add in return\add* give you many good blessings. He will do that so that at all times you will always have
all that you need. Indeed, you will have even more \add than you need. As a result, you will be able to
do\add* many more good things \add to help others\add*. 
\v 9  \add Those who give willingly and cheerfully will be rewarded like the man about
whom\add* it is written {\add about whom\add* someone\f + \ft Or: the Psalmist \f* wrote} in the Scriptures,
\q He generously \add helps others\add*, 
\q \add he gives to those\add* who are poor. 
\q \add God will remember\add* the good things that he did, 
\q \add and reward him with\add* good things forever. 
\p
\v 10  \add God always\add* gives seeds to farmers to plant, and also gives them food to eat.
\add So, similarly, God will\add* always make it possible for you to have enough money \f + \ft metaphor \f*, so that you will be able more and
more to generously \add help those who are needy\add*. 
\v 11  \add God\add* will \add give you\add* many blessings in many different ways as a result of your generously
\add helping others\add*. Furthermore, \add the\add* generous\add gift that you are getting ready
for\add* us\add (exc) to take to the believers in Judea province\add* will cause
\add many people\add* to thank God. 
\p
\v 12  \add Also remember that\add* when you give money to \f + \ft euphemism \f* help God's people, you not only give them what they need, but
also, \add because of that\add*, \add many people will\add* thank God very much
\add for you and for what you have done\add*. 
\v 13 As a result of your giving \add money to help others\add*, they will praise God, not only because you have believed the
good message about Christ, but also because you have \add generously given some of your
possessions\add* so that they and other \add believers will all have\add*
\add enough\f + \ft Or: their needs supplied\add* \f*. 
\v 14 Also, when they pray for you, \add asking God to bless you, they will remember how grateful they
are\add* \f + \ft idiom \f* that God \add caused you to give\add* very willingly and cheerfully.
\v 15  \add Finally, we should all\add* thank God \add because he gave us the greatest gift of all when he sent his Son to
save\f + \ft Or: rescue \f* us(inc)\add* ◄\add from the guilt of our sin\f + \ft Or: from \f* being punished for our
sin\add*►. That is a gift too wonderful for anyone to be able to tell about completely!
