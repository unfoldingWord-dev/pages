\c 6  
\p
\v 1  \add Therefore\add*, because I am working together with God
\add himself\add*, I say this to you very strongly: God has \add already\add* kindly
\add forgiven you because Christ died for you\add*, so do not now
\add say\add* “It does not matter \add if I live just to please myself\add*.”
\v 2 For God said \add long ago in the Scriptures\add*: 
\p When it is the right time \add for me\add* to help you, \add you will ask me to help
you\add*, and I will hear you. Then I will \add send\add* a Savior to help you.
\p \add So listen to what\add* I am telling you: God \add has sent\add* his Savior, so now is the time when
\add God is ready to\add* save \add people from the guilt of their
sins\add*. 
\s 2 Corinthians 6:3-10 
\s In spite of much suffering, we have lived as servants of God should live.
\p
\v 3 Neither I nor the men \add working\add* with me do anything that would hinder people from trusting in Christ, and so we
cannot be accused {no one can accuse \add us\add*} \add of not\add* serving
\add God properly\add*. 
\v 4 Instead, in everything \add that we(exc) say and do\add*, we show
\add people\add* that we serve God faithfully. We patiently endure
\add all the things that happen to us. People cause us\add* many troubles and, as a result, we are anxious
\add and often do not know what to do\add*. 
\v 5 Sometimes we have been beaten \add and bound\add* {People have beaten
\add us and tied us\add*} \add with\add* chains in prison. \add Angry
mobs\add* have attacked us, \add wanting to kill us\add*. We have continued working
\add for God until we had no more strength to work\add*. We have had many sleepless nights, and we have
\add often been without food\add*. 
\v 6  \add All that we think about and all that we do is\add* pure
\add in God's sight\add*. Knowing \add how God wants us to conduct our lives, we do what pleases
him\add*. We are patient \add with those who oppose us\add*. We are kind
\add to all people. We depend on\add* the Holy Spirit \add to help
us\add*. We love people sincerely \add as God wants us to love them\add*.
\v 7 We faithfully teach \add the true\add* message \add about Christ\add*, and God
\add gives us\add* his power \add as we teach it. Like soldiers\add* using weapons \f + \fk metaphor \f*
\add in a battle\add*, we, by \add living\add* righteously, \add defend God's message and refute those who attack
it\add*. 
\v 8  \add We serve God faithfully\add* whether \add people\add* praise
us\add (exc)\add* or \add whether they\add* despise us, whether \add people
say\add* bad things \add about us(exc)\add* or \add whether they
say\add* good things \add about us. We keep teaching\add* the truth,
\add even though some people say that\add* we are deceiving \add people\add*.
\v 9  \add Some people\add* know \add well that we are true servants of God, and yet
others\add*, who know us, refuse to \add believe that. People have often tried
to\add* kill us\add (inc)\add*, yet we are still alive. We have \add often\add* been beaten, but we have not been killed
{\add People have often\add* beaten us\add (exc)\add*, but \add they\add* have not killed us}.
\v 10 Although we\add (exc)\add* are often very sad \add because people have rejected our
message\add*, we are always happy \add because of all that God has done for
us\add*. Even though we\add (exc)\add* are poor, we make \add it possible
for\add* many people to be \add spiritually\add* rich. It is true that
\add in this world\add* we\add (exc)\add* have nothing \add valuable\add* \f + \fk hyperbole \f*, but
\add because we belong to God's family\add*, all \add that God has\add* belongs to us.
\s 2 Corinthians 6:11-13 
\s I ask you to accept us and love us as we love you. 
\p
\v 11 You \add fellow believers\add* in Corinth, \add I have been\add* completely honest with you.
\add I have told you exactly how we(exc) feel about you, that\add* we love you very much \f + \fk idiom \f*.
\v 12 We are not \add treating you as though we do not\add* love you, but you are
\add treating us as though you do\add* not love us. 
\v 13 In return \add for our loving you, will you not\add* love \add us\add* \f + \fk idiom \f* just as
\add much as we love you?\add* I am writing \add to you\add* as if you were my own children.
\s 2 Corinthians 6:14-7:1 
\s Do not get involved with people who do not honor God. 
\p
\v 14 Do not ◄team up/have a close relationship► with anyone who does not trust
\add in Christ. I say this\add* because we who \add trust in Christ and
do\add* what is right should not \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* \add want to do things\add* with wicked people. Or
\add to say it in another way\add*, just like light and darkness never join together, so
\add those who belong to Christ and those who belong to Satan should never join
together\add* \f + \fk rhetorical question \f*. 
\v 15 There is no \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* agreement of any kind between Christ and Satan.
\add So\add*, believers have no \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* common interests with unbelievers.
\v 16  \add Just\add* as no one would \add dare to bring\add* idols into the Temple
\add in Jerusalem\add*, believers should never \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* join with those who worship idols.
\add I say that\add* because \f + \fk metaphor \f* \add the Holy Spirit lives in us, and
so\add* we are \add like\add* the Temple of the all-powerful God\add . It
is\add* as God himself said \add in the Scriptures\add*: 
\q I will live in \add my people\add*. 
\q I will always be with/helping them. 
\q \add They will say to me\add*, “You are our God,” and 
\q \add I will say to them\add*, “You are my people.” 
\p
\v 17  \add In another place in the Scriptures we read that\add* the Lord said:
\q Get away from those who do evil; 
\q keep yourselves separated from them. 
\q Do \add nothing sinful that would make you\add* unacceptable to me.
\q Then I will welcome you \add as members of my family\add*. 
\p
\v 18  \add The Lord also said\add*: 
\q I will \add care for you\add* as \f + \fk metaphor \f* a loving father \add cares for his
children\add*, 
\q and \add it will be as though\add* you are my own sons and daughters.
\q I, the all-powerful Lord, am saying this \add to you\add*.
