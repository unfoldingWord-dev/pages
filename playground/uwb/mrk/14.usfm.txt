\s MARK 14:1-2 
\s The Jewish leaders planned how they could arrest Jesus without starting a riot.
\p
\v 1 It was only two days before the \add people\add* \add celebrated\f + \ft Or: started to
celebrate\add* \f* \add for one week the\add* festival \add which they
called\add* Passover\add . During those days they also\add* \add celebrated\add* the festival of Unleavened
Bread\f + \ft Or: \add ate\add* bread that had no yeast in it \f*. The chief priests and the men who taught the
\add Jewish\add* laws were planning how they could seize Jesus secretly.
\add They wanted to accuse him to the Roman authorities\add* so that they would execute him.
\v 2 But they were saying to one another, "We must not \add do it\add* during the celebration, because,
\add if we do it then\add*, the people will \add be very angry with us
and\add* riot!" 
\s MARK 14:3-11 
\s Jesus commended a woman who extravagantly anointed Jesus in anticipation of his death. The chief priests agreed to pay Judas
if he would help them seize Jesus. 
\p
\v 3 Jesus was at Bethany \add town\add* in the house of Simon, whom
\add Jesus had healed from\add* leprosy. While they were eating, a woman came
\add to him\add*. \add She was carrying\add* a stone jar that contained expensive
\add fragrant\add* perfume called nard. She opened the jar and then she poured the perfume on Jesus' head.
\v 4 One of the people \add who were present\add* became angry and said to the others,
"\add It is terrible that she\add* wasted that perfume!\f + \ft Or: \add Why did
she\add* waste that perfume? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* 
\v 5 It could have been sold \f + \ft Or:\add We\add* could have sold it \f* for a huge amount of money\f + \ft Or: an amount of money for which a
person works for a year \f*, and then \add the money\add* could have been given
\f + \ft Or:\add we\add* could have given \add the money\add* \f* to poor people!" So he rebuked her.
\v 6 But Jesus said, "Stop \add scolding\add* her! She has done to me what I
\add consider to be\add* very appropriate\f + \ft Or: delightful \f*. So you should not bother her!\f + \ft Or: why do you bother her? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 7 You will always have poor people among you. So you can help them whenever you want to. But I will not
\add be here among\add* you much longer. \add So it is good for her to show now that she appreciates
me\add*. 
\v 8  \add It is appropriate that\add* she has done what she was able to do.
\add It is as if she knew that I was going to die soon\add* and has anointed my body for their burying it.
\v 9 I will tell you this: Wherever the good message \add about me\add* is preached \f + \ft Or:people preach the good message \f* throughout
the world, what she has done will be told \f + \ft Or:people will tell others what she has done
\add to me\add* \f*, and as a result people will remember her." 
\p
\v 10 Then Judas Iscariot \f + \ft Or: the man from Kerioth village \f* went to the chief priests in order to
\add talk to them about\add* helping them to seize Jesus. He did that
\add even though\add* he was one of the twelve \add disciples\add*!
\v 11 When they heard \add what he was willing to do for them\add*, they were very happy. They promised that they would give
him \add a large amount of\add* money \add for doing that. Judas agreed, so they gave him the
money\add*. As a result, he \add began\add* watching for an opportunity to betray Jesus\f + \ft Or: to enable Jesus' enemies to seize
him \f*. 
\s MARK 14:12-17 
\s Two disciples followed Jesus' instructions and prepared the Passover meal.
\p
\v 12  \add Two days later\add*, when they killed the lambs \add for
the\add* festival at the beginning of the week when \add people ate\add* bread that had no yeast in it, Jesus' disciples said
to him, "Where do you want us to go and prepare the meal for the
Passover\add celebration\add* in order that you can eat it \add with
us\add*?" 
\v 13 So he \add chose\add* two of his disciples \add to prepare
everything\add*. He said to them, "Go into \add Jerusalem\add* city. A man will meet you, who will be carrying a large jar full
of water. Follow him. 
\v 14 When he enters \add a house\add*, say to the man who owns the house,
'\add Our\add* teacher wants us to prepare \add the meal of\add* the Passover celebration so that he can eat it with us his
disciples. Please show us the room that he \add arranged with you
about\add*.\f + \ft Or: Where is the room that he \add arranged with you about\add*? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*'
\v 15 He will show you a large room that is on the upper floor \add of the
house\add*. It will be furnished and ready \add for us to eat a meal in
it\add*. Then prepare the meal there for us." 
\v 16 So the \add two\add* disciples left. They went into the city and found
\add everything\add* to be just like he had told them. They prepared the
\add meal for\add* the Passover \add celebration and then returned to Jesus and the other
disciples\add*. 
\v 17 When it was evening, Jesus arrived \add at that house\add* with the twelve
\add disciples\add*. 
\s MARK 14:18-26 
\s During the Passover meal, Jesus prophesied that one disciple would betray him, and he gave them the bread and wine which he
said represented his body and blood which would be sacrificed. 
\p
\v 18 As they were all sitting there \add and eating\add*, Jesus said, "Listen carefully to this: One of you will enable my
enemies to seize me. Specifically, it is one of you who \add will do this in spite of the fact that
he\add* is eating with me \add right now\add*!" 
\v 19 The disciples became very sad and they said to him one by one, "Surely it is not I!\f + \ft Or: I am not the one, am I? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*"
\v 20 Then he said to them, "It is one of \add you\add* twelve \add disciples\add*, the one who is dipping
\add bread\add* into the \add sauce in the\add* dish along with me.
\v 21 It is certain that \add I\add*, the one who came from heaven, will
\add die\add*, because that is what has been \f + \ft Or:what \add the prophets\add* have \f* written about me. But there will be terrible
\add punishment\add* for the man by whom I will be betrayed \f + \ft Or:who will betray me( Or: help my enemies to seize me ) \f*! In fact, it
would be better for that man if he had never been born!" 
\p
\v 22 While they were eating, he took \add a flat loaf of\add* bread and thanked God for it. Then he broke it
\add into pieces\add* and gave it to them and said to them, "This
\add bread represents\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* my body. Take it \add and eat it\add*."
\v 23 Afterwards, he took a cup \add that contained wine\add* and thanked
\add God for it\add*. Then he gave it to them, and then, as they all drank from it,
\v 24 he said to them, "This \add wine represents\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* my blood, which is about to be shed \f + \ft Or:which is about to flow from
my body \f* \add when my enemies kill me\add*. With this blood I \add will
sign\add* the agreement \add that God has made to forgive the sins
of\add* many people. 
\v 25 I want you to know this: I will not drink any more wine in this way until the time when I drink it with a new
\add meaning\add* when I begin to rule as a king." 
\v 26 After they sang a hymn, they went out toward Olive \add Tree\add* Hill.
\s MARK 14:27-31 
\s Jesus predicted that Peter would deny three times that he knew Jesus.
\p
\v 27  \add While they were on their way\add*, Jesus said to them, "It has been
\f + \ft Or:\add The prophets\add* have \f* written \add in the Scriptures that God said about
me\add*, 'I will kill the shepherd and his sheep will scatter.' \add Those words will come true. When they are about to capture
me\add*, all of you will leave me and run away. 
\v 28 But after I have been made \f + \ft Or:\add God\add* has made me \f* alive again, I will go ahead of you to Galilee
\add district and meet you there\add*." 
\v 29 Then Peter said to him, "Perhaps all the \add other disciples\add* will leave you, but not I! I will not
\add leave you\add*!" 
\v 30 Then Jesus said to him, "The truth is that this very night, before the rooster crows a second time, you yourself will
deny three times \add that you know\add* me!" 
\v 31 But Peter replied strongly, "Even if they kill me \add as I
defend\add* you, I will never deny \add that I know\add* you!" And all
\add the other disciples\add* said the same thing. 
\s MARK 14:32-42 
\s While the disciples slept, Jesus prayed that God would spare him from the coming suffering.
\p
\v 32  \add On the way\add*, Jesus and the disciples came to the place that
\add people\add* call Gethsemane. Then he said to \add some\f + \ft Or: eight \f*
of\add* his disciples, "Stay here while I pray!" 
\v 33 Then he took Peter, James, and John with him. He became extremely distressed, and he said to them,
\v 34 "I \f + \ft synecdoche \f* am very sorrowful. \add It is as if\add* I were about to die.
\add You men\add* stay here and keep awake!" 
\v 35 He went a bit further and threw himself on the ground. Then he prayed that if it were possible, he would not
\add have to suffer\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*. 
\v 36 He said, "O my Father, \add because\add* you are able to do everything, rescue me so that I do not have to suffer
\add now\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*! But do not \add do\add* what I want. Instead,
\add do\add* what you want!" 
\v 37 Then he returned and found his \add disciples\add* sleeping. He
\add woke them up and\add* said, "Simon! \add I am disappointed
that\add* you fell asleep and that you were not able to stay awake for just a short
time!\f + \ft Or: \add Why is it that\add* you fell asleep and that you were not able to stay awake for just one hour? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*"
\v 38  \add And he said to them\add*, "You want \add to do what I
say\add*, but you are not strong enough \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add to actually do
it\add*. So keep awake and pray in order that you can resist when
\add something like this\add* tempts you!" 
\v 39 Then he went away again and prayed again what he prayed before.
\v 40 When he returned, he found that they were sleeping again because they were
\add so\add* sleepy that they could not keep their eyes open. \add Because they were
ashamed\add*, they did not know what to say to him \add when he awakened
them\add*. 
\v 41  \add Then he went and prayed again\add*. He returned a third time;
\add and he found them sleeping again\add*. He \add woke\add* all of
\add them and\add* said to them, "\add I am disappointed that you
are\add* sleeping again!\f + \ft Or: \add Why are you\add* sleeping again? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\add You have slept\add* enough. The time \add for me to suffer\add* is about to begin. Look! Someone is about to enable sinful
men to seize me, the one who came from heaven. 
\v 42  \add So\add* get up! Let's go \add toward him\add*! Look! Here comes the one who is enabling them to seize me!"
\s MARK 14:43-49 
\s Judas betrayed Jesus. 
\p
\v 43 While he was still speaking, Judas \add arrived\add*. \add Even though he
was\add* one of \add Jesus'\add* twelve \add disciples\add*, he came
\add to enable Jesus' enemies to seize him\add*. A crowd who carried swords and clubs was with him. The
\add leaders of\add* the Jewish Council had sent them. 
\v 44  \add Judas\add*, who was betraying Jesus\f + \ft Or: helping Jesus' enemies to seize him \f*, had
\add previously\add* told this crowd, "The man whom I kiss is the one
\add whom you want. When I kiss him\add*, seize him and lead him away
\add while you guard him\add* carefully." 
\v 45 So, when Judas arrived, he immediately went to Jesus and said, "My teacher!" Then he kissed Jesus
\add on his neck\f + \ft Or: cheek \f*\add*. 
\v 46 Then \add the crowd\add* seized Jesus. 
\v 47 But one of the \add disciples\add* who was standing nearby drew his short sword. He struck the servant of the high priest
with it \add to kill him, but he only\add* cut off his ear. 
\v 48-49 Jesus said to them, "\add It is ridiculous that\add* you come
\add here to seize\add* me with swords and clubs, as if I were a bandit!\f + \ft Or: Have you come
\add here to seize\add* me with swords and clubs, as if I were a bandit \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*? \f* Day after day I was with you in the Temple
\add courtyard\add* teaching\add the people\add*! Why did you not seize me then?
\add But this is happening\add* in order that \add what the prophets have written
in\add* the Scriptures \add about me\add* may be fulfilled \f + \ft Or:may happen \f*."
\s MARK 14:50-52 
\s Mark ran away. 
\p
\v 50 All \add the disciples at once\add* left him and ran away.
\v 51 At that time, a young man\f + \ft Or: I \f* was following Jesus. He, Or: \add I
was\add* wearing only a linen cloth around his\f + \ft Or: my \f* body. The crowd seized him\f + \ft Or: me \f*.
\v 52 But, \add as he\f + \ft Or: I \f* pulled away from them\add*, he\f + \ft Or: I \f* left behind the linen cloth
\add in their hands\add*, and then he\f + \ft Or: I \f* ran away naked. 
\s MARK 14:53-65 
\s After witnesses accusing Jesus contradicted each other, Jesus said that he was the Son of God, the Messiah, after which they
decided that Jesus must die. 
\p
\v 53 The men \add who had seized\add* Jesus led him away to \add the house
where\add* the high priest \add lived\add*. All of the Jewish Council were gathering
\add there\add*. 
\v 54 Peter followed Jesus at a distance. He went into the courtyard
\add of the house\add* where the high priest \add lived\add*, and sat there with the men who guarded
\add the house of the high priest\add*. He was warming himself beside a fire.
\v 55 The chief priests and all the rest of the Jewish council \add had
already\add* tried to find people who would tell lies about Jesus
\add in order that they could convince the Roman authorities\add* to execute him. But they did not succeed,
\v 56 because, although many people spoke lies about him, they contradicted each other.
\v 57  \add Finally\add*, some stood up and accused him falsely by saying,
\v 58 "We heard him when he said, 'I will destroy this Temple that was built by men, and then within three days I will build
another temple without help from anyone else\f + \ft Or: that human hands will not build \f*.'"
\v 59 But, what \add some of\add* these men said also did not agree with
\add what others of them said\add*. 
\p
\v 60 Then the high priest \add himself\add* stood up in front of them and said to Jesus, "Are you not going to reply? What
\add do you say about\add* all the things that they are saying in order to accuse you?"
\v 61 But Jesus was silent and did not reply \f + \ft doublet \f*. Then the high priest
\add tried again\add*. He asked him, "Are you the Messiah? \add Do you say that you
are\add* the Son of God\f + \ft Or: the man who is also God \f*?" 
\v 62 Jesus said, "I am. Furthermore, you will see me, the one who came from heaven,
\add ruling\add* beside God, who is completely powerful. \add You will also see
me\add* coming down through the clouds in the sky!" 
\v 63  \add In response to Jesus' words\add*, the high priest tore his outer garment.
\add That was their custom to show that he was shocked that Jesus had said that he was equal to
God\add*. Then he said, "We certainly do not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* need any \add more\add* people who will testify
\add against this man\add*, 
\v 64  \add because\add* you have heard what he said against God!
\add He claimed to be equal with God\add*! Therefore, what have you decided?" They all said that Jesus was guilty and deserved
to be executed\f + \ft Or: that they should kill him \f*. 
\v 65 Then some of them began spitting on Jesus. They put a blindfold on him, and then they began striking him and saying to
him, "\add If you are\add* a prophet, tell us \add who hit you\add*!" And those who were guarding Jesus struck him with their
hands. 
\s MARK 14:66-72 
\s As Jesus predicted, Peter denied three times that he knew Jesus.
\p
\v 66 While Peter was outside in the courtyard \add of the high priest's
house\add*, one of the girls who worked for the high priest came
\add near him\add*. 
\v 67 When she saw Peter warming himself \add beside the fire\add*, she looked at him
\add closely\add*. Then she said, "You also were with Jesus, that man from Nazareth
\add town\add*!" 
\v 68 But he denied it by saying, "I do not know or understand \f + \ft doublet \f* what you are talking about!" Then he went away
\add from there\add* to the gate \add of the courtyard\add*. 
\v 69  \add Another\add* servant girl saw him there and said again to the people who were standing nearby, "This man is one of
\add those who have been with that man they arrested\add*." 
\v 70 But he denied it again. After a little while, one of those who were standing there said to Peter again,
"\add The way you speak shows that\add* you also are from Galilee
\add district\add*. So it is certain that you are one of those \add who accompanied
Jesus!\add*" 
\v 71 But he began to exclaim, "I do not know the man that you are talking about! Because God knows that I am speaking
truthfully, may he punish me \add if I am lying\add*!" 
\v 72 Immediately the rooster crowed a second time. Then Peter remembered what Jesus had said to him
\add before\add*, "Before the rooster crows a second time, you will deny three times
\add that you know me." When he realized that he had denied it three
times\add*, he started crying.
