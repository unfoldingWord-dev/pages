\p
\v 1 He also said to \add his disciples\add*, "Listen carefully! Some of you who are here now will see God ruling powerfully in
\add many ways\add*. You will see it before you die!" 
\s MARK 9:2-8 
\s Jesus took Peter, James and John up a high mountain where his appearance changed and Moses and Elijah appeared and talked to
Jesus. 
\p
\v 2 A week later Jesus took Peter, James and \add James' younger
brother\add* John and led them up a high mountain. \add While they
were\add* alone up there, he appeared very different to them. 
\v 3 His clothes became dazzling white. They were whiter than anyone on earth could make them by bleaching them.
\v 4  \add Two prophets who had lived long ago\add*, Moses and Elijah, appeared to them. Then the two of them began talking
with Jesus. 
\v 5  \add After a short time\add*, Peter \add interrupted by\add* exclaiming, "Teacher, it is wonderful to be here! So allow
us to make three shelters. One \add will be\add* for you, one \add will
be\add* for Moses, and one \add will be\add* for Elijah!" 
\v 6  \add He said this\add* because\add he wanted to say something,
but\add* he did not know what to say, because he and the other \add two
disciples\add* were very awestruck. 
\v 7 Then a \add shining\add* cloud appeared that covered them. \add God\add* \f + \ft euphemism \f* spoke to them from the cloud saying, "This
is my Son. He is the one whom I love. \add Therefore\add*, listen to him!"
\v 8 When \add the three disciples\add* looked around, they saw that suddenly Jesus was alone with them, and that there was no
longer anyone \add else\add* there. 
\s Mark 9:9-13 
\s Jesus told them that the one like Elijah has already come and been evilly treated, but that the Messiah would also be evilly
treated. 
\p
\v 9 While they were coming down the mountain, Jesus told them that they should not tell anyone
\add yet\add* what had just happened to him. He said, "You may tell them after I, the one who came from heaven, rise from the
dead\f + \ft Or: become alive again \f* after I die." 
\v 10 So they did not tell others about it \add for a long time\add*. But they discussed among themselves what it meant when he
said that he would rise from the dead\f + \ft Or: become alive again \f* after he died.
\p
\v 11  \add The three disciples had just seen Elijah, but Elijah had not done anything to prepare people to accept Jesus.
So\add* they asked Jesus, "The men who teach the \add Jewish\add* laws say that Elijah must come back to the earth before
\add the Messiah comes to earth. But you have been here a long time and Elijah came just today. So is what they are teaching
wrong?\add*" 
\v 12-13  \add Jesus wanted them to know that John the Baptizer was the one who represented Elijah.
So\add* he answered them, "It is true that \add God promised to send Elijah to
come\add* first\add so that people would be ready when I came\add*. Elijah's representative has already come, and our leaders
treated him very badly, just like they wanted to do, just like it was prophesied
{\add the prophets\add* prophesied} long ago. But, I also want you to consider what is written {what
\add the prophets\add* wrote} in the Scriptures about me, the one who came from heaven.\f + \ft Or: why have you not thought about what is
written {what \add the prophets\add* wrote} about me, the one who came from heaven? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* It is written {They wrote} that I
would suffer much and that I would be rejected {that \add many people\add* would reject me}."
\s MARK 9:14-29 
\s Jesus expelled an evil spirit and later explained to the disciples why they had failed to do that.
\p
\v 14  \add Jesus and those three disciples\add* returned to where the
\add other\add* disciples were. They saw a large crowd around the other disciples and
\add some\add* men who taught the \add Jewish\add* laws arguing with them.
\v 15 As soon as the crowd saw Jesus, they were very surprised \add to see him
come\add*. So they ran to him and greeted him. 
\v 16 He asked them, "What are you arguing about?" 
\v 17 A man in the crowd answered him, "Teacher, I brought my son
\add here in order that\add* you \add would heal him\add*. There is an evil spirit in him
\add that makes him\add* unable to talk. 
\v 18 Whenever the spirit attacks him, it throws him down. He foams at the mouth, he grinds his teeth together, and he becomes
stiff. I asked your disciples to expel the spirit, but they were not able to do it."
\v 19 Jesus replied by saying to those people, "I am very disappointed that
\add although you\add* have observed how I help people, you do not
believe\add that you are able to do anything\add*!\f + \ft Or: Why is it that
\add although you\add* have observed how I help people, you do not
believe\add that you are able to do anything\add*? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* I have been with you a long time,
\add and you still cannot do what I do\add*!\f + \ft Or: How long do I have to be with you
\add before you can do what I do\add*? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* Bring the boy to me!"
\v 20 So they brought the boy to Jesus. As soon as the evil spirit saw Jesus, it shook the boy severely, and
\add the boy\add* fell on the ground. He rolled around, and he foamed at the mouth.
\v 21 Jesus asked the boy's father, "How long has he been like this?" He replied,
"\add This started to happen\add* when he was a child. 
\v 22  \add The spirit does not only do this\add*, but he also often throws him into the fire or into the water in order to
kill him. But, pity us and help us, if you can!" 
\v 23 Jesus exclaimed to him, "\add Do not say\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* 'If you can', for
\add God\f + \ft Or: I \f*\add* can do anything for people who believe \add in him\f + \ft Or: me \f*\add*!"
\v 24 Immediately the child's father shouted, "I believe \add that you can help me, but I do not believe
strongly\add*. Help me to believe more strongly!" 
\v 25 Because \add Jesus wanted to heal the boy before\add* the crowd got bigger, he rebuked the evil spirit, saying, "You evil
spirit, you who are \add causing this boy to be\add* deaf and unable to talk! I command you to come out of him and never enter
him again!" 
\v 26 The evil spirit shouted, it shook the boy violently, and then it left the boy. The boy did not move. He seemed like a
dead body. So many of the people there said, "He is dead!" 
\v 27 However, Jesus took him by the hand and helped him get up. Then the boy stood up.
\add He was healed\add*! 
\v 28 Later, when Jesus and his disciples were alone in a house, one of them asked him, "Why were we not able to expel
\add the evil spirit\add*?" 
\v 29 He said to them, "You can expel this kind \add of evil spirit\add* only by your praying
\add that God will give you the power to do it\add*. There is no other way that you can expel them."
\s MARK 9:30-32 
\s Jesus was teaching his disciples that he would be handed over to other men, killed, and become alive again; but they did not
understand what he was saying. 
\p
\v 30 After \add Jesus and his disciples\add* left that \add district\add*, they traveled through Galilee
\add district\add*. Jesus did not want anyone \add else\add* to know
\add that he was in their area\add* 
\v 31  \add lest they interrupt him\add* as he taught his disciples. He was telling them,
"\add Some day my enemies\add* \f + \ft synecdoche \f* will seize \f + \ft metonymy \f* me, the one who came from heaven, and I will be put {they will put me}
into the hands of \add other\add* men. Those men will kill me. But on the third day after I am killed {after they kill me}, I
will become alive again!" 
\v 32 But they did not understand what he was telling them. Also, they were afraid to ask him about what he had said.
\s MARK 9:33-37 
\s Jesus taught his disciples by illustration about what kind of person God considers important.
\p
\v 33 Jesus and his disciples returned to Capernaum \add town\add*. When they were in the house, he asked them, "What were you
discussing \add while we were traveling\add* on the road?" 
\v 34 But they did not reply. \add They were ashamed to reply\add* because,
\add while they were traveling\add*, they had been arguing with each other about which one of them
\add would be\add* the most important \add when Jesus became king\add*.
\v 35 He sat down, he summoned the twelve disciples \add to come close to
him\add*, and then he said to them, "If anyone wants \add God to consider
him\add* to be the most important person of all, he must \add consider
himself\add* to be the least important person of all, and he must serve everyone
\add else\add*." 
\v 36 Then he took a child and placed him among them. He took the child in his arms and then he said to them,
\v 37 "Those who, \add because they love\add* me, welcome a child like this one,
\add God considers that\add* they are welcoming me. So \add it is as
though\add* they are also welcoming \add God\add*, who sent me."
\s MARK 9:38-41 
\s Jesus taught his disciples about who is for him and who is against him.
\p
\v 38 John said to Jesus, "Teacher, we saw someone who was expelling demons,
\add claiming he had\add* authority from you \add to do that\f + \ft Or: while telling
people\add* that you \add have told him to do it\add* \f*. So we told him to stop doing it because he was not one of us
\add disciples\add*." 
\v 39 Jesus said, "Do not tell him \add not to do that\add*. For no one will speak evilly about me just after he performs a
miracle while saying that I \add have told him to do it\add*. 
\v 40 Furthermore, those who are not opposing us are trying to \add achieve the same goals
that\add* we are. 
\v 41 Also think about this: Those \add who belong to me who help you in any way,
even\add* if they \add just\add* give you a cup of water to drink because you follow
\add me\add*, the Messiah, will certainly be rewarded \add by God\add*!"
\s MARK 9:42-48 
\s Jesus taught his disciples about sin and its result. 
\p
\v 42  \add Jesus also said\add*, "But if you cause someone who believes in me to sin,
\add God will severely punish you\add*, even if that person is \add socially unimportant
like\add* this little child. If someone tied a heavy stone around your neck and you were thrown {and threw you} into the sea,
\add you would consider that was a severe punishment. But God will punish you more
severely\add* than that \add if you cause a person who believes in me to
sin\add*. 
\v 43-44  \add So\add*, if you are \add wanting to use one of\add* \f + \ft metonymy, personification \f*
\add your hands to sin, stop using your hand! Even if you have to\add* cut your hand off and throw it away
\add to avoid sinning, do it\add* \f + \ft hyperbole \f*! It is good that you not sin and that you live eternally,
\add even though you lack one of\add* your hands\add while you are here on
earth\add*. But it is not good that you sin and as a result God throws your whole body into hell. There the fires never go out!
\v 45-46 If you are \add wanting to use\add* one of \f + \ft personification \f* your feet to sin,
\add stop using your foot! Even if you have to\add* cut off your
foot\add to avoid sinning, do it\add* \f + \ft hyperbole \f*! It is good that you not sin and live eternally,
\add even though\add* you lack one of your feet \add while you are here on
earth\add*. But is not good that you sin and go to hell. 
\v 47 If because of what you see \f + \ft metonymy, personification \f* you are tempted to sin,
\add stop looking at those things\add*! Even if you have to gouge out your eye and throw it away \f + \ft hyperbole \f*
\add to avoid sinning, do it! It is good that you not sin and live eternally, even though you lack one
of\add* your eyes\add while you are here on earth\add*. But it is not good that you sin and, as a result, God puts your whole
body in hell. 
\v 48 In that place people suffer forever and the fires are never put out {never go out}."
\s Mark 9:49-50 
\s Jesus taught that we must endure trials to remain useful to God.
\p
\v 49 "\add You must endure difficulties in order that God will be pleased with you. Your difficulties are
like\add* a fire \add that makes things pure\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. \add Your enduring is also
like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* salt being put \add on\add* {people putting salt on their}
\add sacrifices to make them pure\add*. 
\v 50 Salt is useful \add to put on food\add*, but you cannot \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* make salt to taste salty again if it becomes flavorless
\f + \ft metaphor \f*. Similarly, you must remain useful to God\add , because no one can make you useful to God again if you become
useless\add*. You must also live peacefully with each other."
