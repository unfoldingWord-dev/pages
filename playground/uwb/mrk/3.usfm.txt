\s MARK 3:1-6 
\s After Jesus healed a man with a withered arm on the Sabbath, Jewish leaders began to plan to kill him.
\p
\v 1  \add On another\add* ◄\add Sabbath/Jewish day of rest\add*►, Jesus entered ◄the synagogue/the Jewish meeting place►
again. There was a man there whose hand was shriveled. 
\v 2  \add Some men of the Pharisee sect\add* watched him carefully in order to see whether he would heal the man ◄on the
Sabbath/on the Jewish rest day►. They did this in order that \add if he healed the
man\add*, they would accuse him of disobeying \add their Jewish laws, because he
worked\add* ◄\add on the Sabbath/on the Jewish rest day\add*►. 
\v 3 Jesus said to the man whose hand was shriveled, “Stand up here in front of everyone!”
\add So the man stood up\add*. 
\v 4 Then Jesus said \add to the Pharisees\add*, “Do the laws \add that God gave
Moses\add* permit people to do good ◄\add on the Sabbath/on the Jewish rest
day\add*►, or do they permit people to do evil? Specifically, do his laws permit us to save a person's life ◄on the Sabbath/on
the Jewish rest day►, or \add do they permit us\add* to let him die
\add by refusing to help him\add*?” But they did not reply. 
\v 5 He looked around at them angrily. He was very distressed that they were stubbornly
\add not wanting to help the man\add*. So he said to the man, “Reach out your hand!” When the man reached out his withered
hand, his hand became all right again! 
\v 6 Then the Pharisees \add decided to get rid of Jesus. So\add* after they left
\add the meeting house\add*, they \add immediately met with some
of\add* the Jews who supported Herod \add Antipas, who ruled Galilee
district\add*. Together they planned how they could kill Jesus. 
\s MARK 3:7-12 
\s Many people came from various areas to hear Jesus, because he had healed many.
\p
\v 7 Jesus and his disciples left \add that\add* town and went to an area further along
\add Galilee lake in order to get away from the people\add*. But a great crowd of people followed him. They were people who
came from Galilee \add district\add*, 
\v 8 from Jerusalem \add city\add*, from \add other towns of\add* Judea
\add district\add*, from Idumea \add district\add*, from \add the region
on\add* the\add east\add* side of the Jordan \add River\add*, and from
\add the region\add* around Tyre and Sidon \add cities\add*. This great crowd of people came to him because they heard about
what he was doing. 
\v 9-10 Because he had healed many people, many \add other\add* people who had various illnesses pushed forward in order that
by touching him \add they would come well\add*. So he told his disciples that they should get a small boat ready for him
\add to get in and teach from it\add*. He wanted to do this in order that the crowd would not crush him
\add when they pushed forward to touch him\add*. 
\v 11 Whenever the evil spirits saw Jesus, \add they caused the people whom they
controlled\add* to fall down in front of Jesus \add in recognition of Jesus'
power\add*. Then they exclaimed, “You are ◄the Son of God/the man who is also God►!”
\v 12 He commanded the \add evil spirits\add* strongly that they should not tell anyone who he was.
\s MARK 3:13-19 
\s Jesus appointed the twelve apostles. 
\p
\v 13 Jesus went \add with many other people\add* up into the hills. After he picked out
\add from among them\add* the men whom he wanted, they came \add close\add* to him.
\v 14 He appointed twelve men in order that they might be with him and in order that he might send them out to preach. He
called them apostles. 
\v 15 He also gave them power in order that they might expel evil spirits
\add from people\add*. 
\v 16 These were the twelve men he appointed: Simon, to whom he gave the
\add new\add* name Peter; his \add younger\add* brother Andrew; 
\v 17 James, \add the son\add* of Zebedee, and John, the \add younger\add* brother of James, to
\add both of\add* whom he added the \add new\add* name, ‘Men who are like
Thunder\add ’ because of their fiery zeal\add*; 
\v 18 Philip; Bartholomew; Levi, whose other name was Matthew; Thomas;
\add another\add* James, the son of Alphaeus; Thaddeus; \add another\add* Simon, who was a
\add member of the party that wanted\add* to overthrow \add the Roman
government\add*; 
\v 19 and Judas Iscariot (OR, \add from the town of\add* Kerioth). He was the one who
\add later\add* ◄betrayed Jesus/helped Jesus' enemies seize him►.
\s MARK 3:20-30 
\s Jesus explained why their claim that he was expelling evil spirits by Satan's power was ridiculous, and that such a claim
was an unforgivable sin. 
\p
\v 20 Jesus \add along with his disciples\add* went to the house where he was
staying\add in Capernaum. Again a crowd gathered where he was\add*. There were many people crowding around him, so that he and
his disciples had no time when they could eat or \add when they could do anything
else\add*. 
\v 21 After his relatives heard about this, they went to take him home
\add with them\add* because ◄some people/they► were saying that he was insane.
\p
\v 22  \add Around that time\add* some men who taught the \add Jewish\add* laws came down from Jerusalem
\add city. They heard that Jesus was expelling demons\add*. So they were telling
\add people\add*, “Beelzebub, who rules the evil spirits, controls him. He is the one who enables this man to expel evil
spirits \add from people\add*!” 
\v 23 Jesus summoned those men. \add Then he spoke to them\add* in parables
\add to enable them to realize that Satan would not oppose his own evil spirits. He also wanted them to realize that by
expelling evil spirits, he was demonstrating that he was much more powerful than
Satan\add*. So he said, “◄\add It is ridiculous\add* to suggest that Satan would expel his own
\add evil spirits\add*!/Why would Satan expel his own \add evil spirits\add*?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*
\v 24 If \add people who live in the same\add* country are fighting one another, they will cease to be a single group under one
ruler. 
\v 25 And if \add people who live in the same\add* house fight each other, they will certainly not remain
\add as one family\add*. 
\v 26 Similarly, if Satan and his \add evil spirits\add* were fighting one another, instead of remaining strong, he would
become powerless. 
\v 27 Contrary to \add what you say about me\add*, someone can enter the house of a strong man
\add like Satan\add* and carry off his possessions only if he first ties up the strong man. Then
\add and only then\add* will he \add be able to\add* steal the things in that man's house.”
\v 28  \add Jesus also said\add*, “Consider this carefully! People may sin in many ways and they may speak evilly about God,
but \add if\add* they \add then are sorry and ask God to\add* forgive
\add them\add*, \add God\add* can forgive them for doing that. 
\v 29 But if anyone speaks evil words about what the Holy Spirit
\add does\add*, \add God\add* will never forgive that. That person is eternally guilty of sin.”
\p
\v 30  \add Jesus told them that\add* because \add they refused to admit that the Holy Spirit was helping him to expel demons.
Instead\add*, they were saying, “An evil spirit is controlling him!”
\s MARK 3:31-35 
\s Jesus told them that those who obey God are as dear to him as his close relatives.
\p
\v 31 Jesus' mother and \add younger\add* siblings arrived. While they stood outside, they sent
\add someone inside\add* in order to call him \add outside\add*.
\v 32 A crowd was sitting around Jesus. One of them said to him, “Listen/Hey, your mother and your
\add younger\add* brothers and sisters are outside, and they are wanting ◄to see/to talk with► you!”
\v 33 Jesus replied to them, “◄\add I will tell you something about\add* my mother and my
brothers.\add /Do you know whom I consider to be like\add* my mother and my brothers?►” \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*
\v 34 After he looked around at \add the disciples\add* who were sitting around him
\add in a circle\add*, he said, “Look here! I \add love these men as much
as\add* I \add love\add* my mother and my brothers. 
\v 35 Those who habitually do what God wants are \add as dear to
me\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f* as my brother, my sister, or my mother!”
