\s MARK 8:1-10 
\s Again Jesus provided food miraculously for a great crowd who gathered to hear him and became hungry.
\p
\v 1 During those days, a large crowd of people gathered again. \add After they had been there a couple
days\add*, they had no food to eat. So Jesus summoned the disciples
\add to come closer\add* and then he said to them, 
\v 2 “This is the third day that these people have been with me, and they have nothing
\add left\add* to eat, so now I feel very sorry for them. 
\v 3 Furthermore, if I send them home \add while they are still\add* hungry,
\add some of\add* them will faint on the way home, because some of them have come from far away.”
\v 4  \add Knowing that he was suggesting that they give the people something to eat, one
of\add* his disciples replied, “◄We cannot possibly find food to satisfy this crowd, here in this place where no people
live!/How can we find food to satisfy this crowd, here in this place where no people live?►” \f + \fk rhetorical question \f*
\v 5 Jesus asked them, “How many loaves of bread do you have?” They replied,
“\add We have\add* seven \add flat loaves\add*.” 
\v 6 Jesus commanded the crowd, “Sit down on the ground!” \add After they sat
down\add*, he took the seven loaves, he thanked \add God for them\add*, he broke them
\add into pieces\add* and started giving them to his disciples in order that they might distribute them
\add to the people\add*. 
\v 7  \add They found that\add* they \add also\add* had a few small
\add dried\add* fish. So after he thanked God for these, he told the disciples, “Distribute these also.”
\add After they distributed the bread and fish to the crowd\add*,
\v 8 the people ate this food and they had plenty \add to\add* satisfy
\add them\add*. \add The disciples\add* collected the pieces of food that were left over.
\add They filled\add* seven large baskets full of those pieces. 
\v 9  \add They estimated that\add* there were about four thousand people
\add who ate on that day\add*. 
\v 10 Jesus dismissed the crowd. Immediately after that, he got into the boat along with his disciples, and they went
\add around Lake Galilee\add* to Dalmanutha district. 
\s MARK 8:11-21 
\s Jesus rebuked those who insisted on him performing more miracles, and rebuked the disciples when they worried about not
having enough food with them. 
\p
\v 11  \add In those days some\add* Pharisees came to Jesus. They asked him
\add to perform\add* a miracle \add that would show that\add* God
\add had sent him\add*. They wanted to \add find a way by which they
could\add* convince the people to reject him. \add So\add* they started to argue with him.
\v 12 Jesus sighed deeply within himself, and then he said, “I am disgusted that \f + \fk rhetorical question \f*,
\add even though\add* you people have seen how I \add have healed
people\add*, you keep asking me to perform miracles! Note this: Such a miracle will certainly not be shown {I will certainly
not show such a miracle} \add just\add* for you people!” 
\v 13 Then he left them. 
\p He got into the boat again, along \add with his disciples\add*, and they went further around
\add Lake Galilee\add*. 
\v 14 The disciples had forgotten to bring along \add enough\add* food. Specifically, they had only one flat loaf of bread with
them in the boat. 
\v 15  \add As they were going\add*, Jesus warned them against \add the attitudes the Pharisees and Herod Antipas had,
attitudes that were having a bad effect on other people. He did this by telling them a
parable\add*. He said, “Be careful! Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and the yeast of Herod!”
\v 16  \add The disciples misunderstood him\add*. So they said to one another,
“\add He must have said that\add* because we have no bread.” 
\v 17 Jesus knew \add what they were discussing among themselves\add*. So he said to them,
“◄\add I am disappointed that you are\add* discussing about your not having enough bread!/Why are you discussing about your not
having enough bread?► \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* ◄You should understand by now \add that I can provide miraculously for you if you need
food!\add*/Why do you not yet perceive or understand \add that I can provide miraculously for you if you need
food\add*?► \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* ◄You are not thinking!/Why are you not thinking?► \f + \fk rhetorical question \f*
\v 18 ◄I am also disappointed that, although you have eyes, you do not
\add understand what you\add* see!/Why is it that, although you have eyes, you do not
\add understand what you\add* see?► \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* You have ears, but you do not understand
\add what I say\add* \f + \fk rhetorical question \f*!” \add Then he asked\add*, “Do you not remember
\add what happened\add* 
\v 19 when I broke \add only\add* five loaves \add and fed\add* the five thousand people \f + \fk rhetorical question \f*?
\add Not only was everyone satisfied, but there was food left over\add*! How many baskets full of pieces of bread
\add that were left over\add* did you collect?” They replied, “We collected twelve baskets full.”
\v 20 Then he asked, “When I broke the seven loaves in order to \add feed\add* the four thousand people,
\add again when everyone had plenty to eat\add*, how many large baskets
\add of pieces of bread that were left over\add* did you collect?” They replied,
“\add We collected\add* seven \add large baskets full\add*.” 
\v 21 Then he kept saying to them, “◄\add I am disappointed that\add* you do not understand yet
\add that you should never worry that you do not have enough food\add*!/Why do you not understand yet
\add that you should never worry that you do not have enough food\add*?►” \f + \fk rhetorical question \f*
\s MARK 8:22-26 
\s Jesus healed a blind man. 
\p
\v 22 They arrived \add in the boat\add* at Bethsaida \add town\add*. People brought to Jesus a blind man and earnestly
requested that Jesus touch him \add in order to heal him\add*. 
\v 23 Jesus took the hand of the blind man, led him outside the town, he put his saliva on the man's eyes, he put his hands on
the man, and then he asked him, “Do you see anything?” 
\v 24 The man looked up and then he said, “\add Yes\add*, I see people! They are walking around, but I cannot see them
\add clearly\add*. They look like trees!” 
\v 25 Then Jesus again touched the eyes of the blind man. The man looked intently and at that moment he was completely healed!
He could see everything clearly. 
\v 26 Jesus said to him, “Do not go into the town! \add First go straight home and tell the people there about what I
did\add*!” Then he sent the man to his home. 
\s MARK 8:27-30 
\s On the way to the villages near the city of Caesarea Philippi, Jesus asked his disciples what people were saying about who
he was and, then, what they thought. 
\p
\v 27 Jesus and the disciples \add left Bethsaida town and went to the villages near Caesarea Philippi
town\add*. On the way he questioned them, “Who do people say that I
\add really\add* am?” 
\v 28 They replied, “\add Some people say\add* that you are John the Baptizer,
\add who has come back to life again\add*. Others say \add that you are the
prophet\add* Elijah \add who has returned from heaven as God promised\add*. And others say that you are one of the
\add other former\add* prophets \add who has come back to life again\add*.”
\v 29 He asked them, “What about you? Who do you say that I am?” Peter replied to him,
“\add We believe that\add* you are the Messiah!” 
\v 30 Then Jesus warned them strongly that they should not tell anyone
\add yet that he was the Messiah\add*. 
\s MARK 8:31-33 
\s Jesus spoke plainly to his disciples about his coming death and resurrection.
\p
\v 31 Then Jesus began to teach them, “\add Even though\add* I am the one who came from heaven, it is necessary that I suffer
very much. It is also necessary that I be rejected by the elders, the chief priests, and the men who teach the
\add Jewish\add* laws {that the elders, the chief priests, and the men who teach the
\add Jewish\add* laws reject me}, and that I be killed {they kill me}. But on the third day
\add after I am killed I\add* will become alive again.” 
\v 32 He said this to them clearly. But Peter took Jesus aside and then,
\add because he assumed that the Messiah would never die\add*, he started to rebuke Jesus
\add for talking about dying\add*. 
\v 33 Jesus turned around and looked at his disciples. Then he rebuked Peter, saying, “Stop thinking like that! Satan
\add is causing you to talk like that! Instead\add* of wanting what God wants
\add me to do, you are wanting\add* me to do \add only\add* what
\add most\add* people \add would want me to do\add*.” 
\s MARK 8:34-9:1 
\s Jesus explained to the crowd and his disciples what is required if anyone wants to be Jesus' disciple.
\p
\v 34 Then he summoned the crowd along with his disciples \add so that they might listen to
him\add*. He told them, “If any one \add of you\add* wants to be my disciple, you must not do
\add only\add* what you yourself want to do. Specifically, you must
\add be willing to allow people to hurt you and to disgrace you. That is what they do to
criminals\add* who are forced to carry crosses \f + \fk metaphor \f* \add to the places where they will be
crucified\add*. That is what anyone who wants to be my disciple must do.
\v 35  \add You must do that\add*, because those who try to save their lives
\add by denying that they belong to me when people want to kill them for believing in
me\add* will not live \add eternally\add*, but those who are killed because of being my
\add disciples\add* and \add because of telling others my\add* good message will live
\add forever with me\add*. 
\v 36 People might get everything \add they want\add* in this world, but ◄they are really gaining nothing if they do not get
eternal life \add because they do not become my disciples!\add*/what will they gain if they do not get eternal life
\add because they do not become my disciples\add*?► \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* 
\v 37 ◄\add Think carefully about the fact that\add* there is absolutely nothing that people can give
\add to God\add* that would enable them to gain eternal life!/Is there anything that a person can give
\add to God\add* in order to gain eternal life?► \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* 
\v 38 And think about this: Those who refuse \add to say that they belong
to\add* me and who reject what I say in these days when many people have turned away
\add from God\add* and are very sinful, I, the one who came from heaven, will also refuse
\add to say that they belong to me\add* when I come back with the holy angels and have the glorious brightness that my Father
has!”
