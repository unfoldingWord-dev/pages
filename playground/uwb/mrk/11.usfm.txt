\s MARK 11:1-11 
\s They brought a young donkey to Jesus; then Jesus mounted it and rode to Jerusalem with people shouting praise of him as they
went along. 
\p
\v 1 When they came near to Jerusalem, they came to Bethphage and Bethany
\add villages\add* near Olive \add Tree\add* Hill. Then Jesus \add summoned\add* two of his disciples.
\v 2 He said to them, “Go to that village just ahead of you. As soon as you enter it, you will see a donkey that no one has
ever ridden, that has been tied {people have tied} up. Untie it, and then bring it
\add to me\add*. 
\v 3 If anyone says to you, ‘Why are you doing that?’, say, \add ‘Jesus\add*, our Lord, needs
\add to use\add* it. He will send it back here \add with someone\add* as soon as
\add he no longer needs it\add*.’” 
\v 4 So \add the two disciples\add* went and they found a young donkey. It was tied close to the door
\add of a house\add*, which was beside the street. Then they untied it.
\v 5 Some of the \add people who were there\add* said to them, “Why are you untying the donkey?”
\v 6 They told them what Jesus had said. So the people permitted them
\add to take the donkey\add*. 
\v 7 They brought the donkey to Jesus. \add The disciples\add* put their cloaks on it
\add in order to make something for him to sit on\add*. 
\v 8 Many people spread their cloaks on the road \add to honor him as a
king\add*. Others, \add in order to honor him\add*, spread along the road branches that they cut from
\add palm trees\add* in the fields \add beside the road\add*. 
\v 9 The people who were going in front of him and behind him were all shouting
\add things like\add*, “Praise God!” “May God bless this one who comes with his authority\f + \ft Or: as his representative \f* \f + \ft metonymy \f*.”
\v 10 “May you be blessed {May \add God\add* bless you} when you rule
\add like\add* our ancestor \add King\add* David ruled!” “Praise God who is in the highest heaven!”
\p
\v 11 He entered Jerusalem \add with them\add*, and then he went into the Temple
\add courtyard\add*. After he looked around at everything \add there\add*, he left
\add the city\add* because it was already late \add in the afternoon\add*. He returned to Bethany
\add town\add* with the twelve \add disciples and slept there\add*.
\s MARK 11:12-14 
\s Jesus cursed a fig tree as a sign of what would happen to the people of Israel.
\p
\v 12 The next day, as Jesus and his disciples were leaving Bethany, Jesus was hungry.
\v 13 He saw from a distance a fig tree with all its leaves, so he went
\add to it\add* to see if he could find any \add figs\add* on it. But when he came to it, he found only leaves on it. This was
because it was not yet time when \add normal fig trees have ripe\add* figs.
\v 14  \add But to illustrate how God would punish the nation of
Israel,\add* he said to the tree, “No one shall ever eat from you again
\add because you will no longer bear figs\add*.” The disciples heard what he said.
\s MARK 11:15-19 
\s Jesus expelled those who were buying and selling goods in the Temple and taught that the Temple was to be a place of prayer.
These actions angered the priests and scribes who, then, looked for a way to kill Jesus.
\p
\v 15 Jesus and his disciples went \add back\add* to Jerusalem. He entered the Temple
\add courtyard. He saw people\add* who were selling and buying \add animals for sacrifices. They were spoiling the place of
worship\add*. He chased those people \add from the Temple courtyard. He also overturned the tables of those who were giving
Temple tax money in exchange for Roman\add* coins. He overturned the seats of the men who were selling doves
\add for sacrifice\add*, 
\v 16 and he would not allow anyone who was carrying anything \add to
sell\add* to go through the Temple \add area\add*. 
\v 17 Then as he taught those people, he said to them, “It is written
{\add One of the prophets\add* wrote} \add in the Scriptures that God
said\add*, ‘\add I want\add* my house to be called {\add people\add* to call my house} a house where
\add people from\add* all nations may pray’, but you bandits have made it
\add like\add* a cave where you can hide! ◄\add You know that!\f + \ft Or: Do \f* you not know
that\add*?► \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*” 
\v 18 The chief priests and the men who taught the \add Jewish\add* laws
\add later\add* heard \add about what he had done\add*. So they planned how they might kill him,
\add but they knew that it would be difficult\add*, because they realized that the crowd was amazed at what he was teaching and
they feared \add that the people would soon decide that Jesus had more authority over the Temple than they
did\add* \f + \ft Or: \add feared what the people would do if they tried to arrest
Jesus\add* \f*. 
\v 19 That evening, \add Jesus and his disciples\add* left the city
\add and again slept in Bethany\add*. 
\s MARK 11:20-25 
\s When Jesus and his disciples passed the fig tree that Jesus had cursed, they saw that it had withered. Jesus used this as an
illustration for trusting that God would answer prayer. 
\p
\v 20  \add The next\add* morning while they were going along \add the road toward Jerusalem, they saw that the fig tree that
Jesus had cursed\add* had withered completely. 
\v 21 Peter remembered \add what Jesus had said to the fig tree\add* and he exclaimed to Jesus, “Teacher, look! The fig tree
that you cursed has withered!” 
\v 22 Jesus replied, “\add You should not be surprised that God did what I
asked!\add* You must trust that God \add will do whatever you ask him to
do!\add* 
\v 23  \add Also\add* note this: If anyone says to this hill, ‘Be raised up {Rise up} and then be thrown {throw yourself} into
the lake!’ and if he does not doubt \add that what he asks for will
happen\add*, that is, if he believes that what he asks for will happen,
\add God\add* will do it for him. 
\v 24 So I tell you, whenever you ask \add God\add* for something when you pray, believe that you will receive it, and,
\add if you do, God\add* will do it \add for you\add*. 
\v 25-26 Now, I \add tell you this also\add*: Whenever you are praying, if you have a grudge against people
\add because they have harmed you\add*, forgive them, in order that your Father in heaven will
\add likewise\add* forgive your sins.” 
\s MARK 11:27-33 
\s The chief priests, scribes and elders asked Jesus by what authority he was doing these things. He, then, asked them a
question that they would not answer; so he did not answer theirs.
\p
\v 27 Jesus and his disciples arrived in the Temple \add courtyard\add* in Jerusalem again. While Jesus was walking
\add there, a group consisting of\add* chief priests, \add some\add* men who taught the
\add Jewish\add* laws, and elders came to him and they said to him,
\v 28 “By what authority are you doing these things? Who authorized you to do things
\add like those you did here yesterday\add*?” 
\v 29 Jesus said to them, “I will ask you one question. If you answer me, I will tell you who authorized me to do those things.
\v 30 Did God \f + \ft metonymy \f* or people \add authorize\add* John to baptize
\add those who came to him\add*?” 
\v 31 They debated among themselves \add as to what they should answer\add*. They
\add said to each other\add*, “If we say that it was God \add who
authorized\add* him, he will say to us, ‘Therefore, ◄you should have believed what John said!\f + \ft Or: why \f* did you not believe what John
said?► \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*’ 
\v 32 On the other hand, if we say that it was people \add who authorized John, then what will happen to
us\add*?” They were afraid \add to say that about where John got his authority, because they knew
that\add* the people \add would be very angry with them. They knew
that\add* all the people truly believed that John was a prophet \add whom God had
sent\add*. 
\v 33 So they answered Jesus, “We do not know \add where John got his
authority\add*.” Then Jesus said to them, “\add Because you did not answer my question,
I\add* will not tell you who authorized me to do those things \add here
yesterday\add*.”
