\s MARK 7:1-23 
\s Some Pharisees and scribes criticized Jesus about his disciples disobeying the traditions of the elders. Jesus replied,
showing that their attitudes and practices were mistaken. 
\p
\v 1  \add One day some\add* Pharisees and some men who teach the
\add Jewish\add* laws gathered around Jesus. They had come from Jerusalem
\add to investigate him\add*. 
\v 2-4 The Pharisees and all of the \add other\add* Jews \add strictly\add* observe their traditions that their ancestors
\add taught. For example, they refuse to\add* eat until they first wash their hands
\add with a special ritual\add*, especially after they \add return\add* from
\add buying things in\add* the marketplace. \add They think that God will be angry with them if they do not do that, because
some person or thing unacceptable to God might have touched\add*
◄\add them/the things they bought\add*►. There are many other such
\add traditions\add* that they accept and try to obey. Specifically, they wash
\add in a special way\add* their cups, pots, kettles, containers, and beds
\add in order that using these things will not make God reject them\add*.
\p
\v 5 That day, those Pharisees and men who taught the \add Jewish\add* laws saw that some of his disciples were eating food
with hands that they had not washed \add using the special ritual\add*. So they questioned Jesus, saying,
“\add Your\add* disciples disobey the traditions of our ancestors! ◄You should not
\add let them\add* eat food if they have not washed their hands \add using our special
ritual\add*!/Why do you \add let them\add* eat food if they have not washed their hands
\add using our special ritual\add*?► \f + \fk rhetorical question \f*” 
\v 6 Jesus said to them, “Isaiah \add rebuked your ancestors\add*, and his words describe very well you people who only pretend
to be good! He wrote these words \add that God said\add*: 
\q These people speak\add as if they\add* honor me, but they \f + \fk synecdoche \f* really do not think about honoring me at all.
\v 7 It is useless for them to worship me, because they teach only what people have commanded
\add as if I myself had commanded them\add*. 
\p
\v 8 You, \add like your ancestors\add*, refuse \add to do\add* what God has commanded. Instead, you follow only the traditions
that ◄others/your ancestors► have \add taught\add*.” 
\v 9 Jesus also said to them, “\add You think\add* \f + \fk irony \f* that you are clever in refusing to do what God commanded just so that
you can obey your own traditions! 
\v 10  \add For example, our ancestor\add* Moses \add wrote God's\add* command, ‘Honor your fathers and your mothers’. He also
wrote, ‘\add The authorities must\add* execute a person who speaks evil about his father or mother.’
\v 11-12 But you \add teach people that it is all right that people no longer must help their parents. You teach people that it
is all right if people\add* give their things to God \add instead of giving them to their
parents\add*. You allow them to say to their parents, ‘What I was going to give to you
\add to provide for you, I have now promised to\add* give to God. So I
\add cannot any longer help you!\add*’ As a result, you are \add actually telling
people\add* that they no longer have to help their parents! 
\v 13 And, by doing that, you disregard what God commanded! You teach your own traditions to others
\add and tell them strongly that they should obey them\add*! And you do many other things like that.”
\p
\v 14 Then Jesus again summoned the crowd \add to come closer. Then\add* he said to them
\add figuratively\add*, “All of you people listen to me! \add Try
to\add* understand \f + \fk doublet \f* \add what I am about to tell you\add*. 
\v 15-16 Nothing that people eat causes \add God to\add* consider them to be unacceptable. On the contrary, it is that which
comes from people's ◄inner beings/hearts► that causes God to reject them.”
\p
\v 17 After Jesus had left the crowd and then entered a house with the disciples, they questioned him about the parable
\add that he had just spoken\add*. 
\v 18 He replied to them, “◄\add I am disappointed that\add* you also do not understand
\add what it means!\add*/Why can you not understand \add what it
means\add*?► \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* ◄You ought to understand that nothing that \add enters us
from\add* outside can cause \add God to\add* consider us unacceptable to him./Can you not understand that nothing that
\add enters us from\add* outside of us can cause \add God to\add* consider us unacceptable to him?► \f + \fk rhetorical question \f*
\v 19 Instead of entering \add and ruining\add* our minds/souls, it goes into our stomachs, and afterwards the refuse passes
out \add of our bodies\add*.” By saying this, Jesus was declaring that people
\add can eat\add* any food without causing \add God\add* to reject them.
\v 20 He also said, “It is the \add thoughts and actions\add* that come from within people that cause
\add God\add* to consider them unacceptable to him. 
\v 21 Specifically, it is people's innermost being \add that causes them
to\add* think things that are evil; they act immorally, they steal
\add things\add*, they commit murder. 
\v 22 They \add commit\add* adultery, they are greedy, they \add act\add* maliciously, they deceive
\add people\add*. They \add act\add* indecently, they envy \add people\add*, they speak evil about others, they are proud, and
they \add act\add* foolishly. 
\v 23 People think \add these thoughts\add* and then they do these evil actions, and that is what causes
\add God to\add* consider them unacceptable to him.” 
\s MARK 7:24-30 
\s Jesus went to the region around Tyre to be away from people, but they learned of it and a woman came to ask him to expel an
evil spirit from her daughter. 
\p
\v 24 After Jesus \add and his disciples\add* left \add Galilee district\add*, they went to the region around Tyre
\add city\add*. While he stayed at a certain house, he desired that no one know
\add it\add*, but people soon found out \add that he was there\add*.
\v 25 A certain woman, whose daughter had an evil spirit \add within
her\add*, heard about Jesus. At once she came to him and prostrated herself at his feet.
\v 26 This woman \add was not a Jew. Her ancestors came\add* from
Greece\add country\add*, but she was born in \add the region around\add* Phoenicia
\add town\add* in Syria district. She pleaded with Jesus that he expel the evil spirit from her daughter.
\v 27 But he \add wanted to see how strongly she believed in him. So, suggesting that he should help the Jews first and not the
non-Jews whom some Jews called dogs\add* \f + \fk metaphor \f*, \add he\add* spoke to her saying, “First let the children eat all they want,
because it is not good for someone to take the food \add the mother has
prepared\add* for the children and then throw it to the \add little\add* dogs.”
\v 28 But \add to show that she believed that non-Jews could also receive help from
God\add* \f + \fk metaphor \f*, she replied to him, “Sir, \add what you say is\add* correct, but even the
\add little\add* dogs, which lie under the table, eat the crumbs that the children
\add drop\add*.” 
\v 29  \add Jesus\add* said to her, “Because of what you have said,
\add you have shown me that you believe in what I can do for you\add*. So I will help you. Now you may go
\add home, because I have caused\add* the evil spirit to leave your daughter.”
\v 30 The woman returned to her house and saw that her child was lying
\add quietly\add* on the bed and that the evil spirit had left. 
\s MARK 7:31-37 
\s When Jesus went back to Lake Galilee, some people brought a deaf-mute man to Jesus and asked him to heal the man, which he
did. 
\p
\v 31 Jesus \add and his disciples\add* left the region around Tyre
\add city\add* and went \add north\add* through Sidon \add city\add*, then
\add toward the east\add* through the district of the Ten Towns, and then
\add south\add* to \add the towns near\add* Lake Galilee. 
\v 32  \add There\add*, people brought to him a man who was deaf and who could hardly talk. They begged
\add Jesus\add* to lay his hands on him \add in order to heal him\add*.
\v 33  \add So Jesus\add* took him away from the crowd \add in order that the two of them could
be\add* alone. Then he put \add one of\add* his fingers into \add each
of\add* the man's ears. After he spat \add on his fingers\add*, he touched the man's tongue
\add with his fingers\add*. 
\v 34 Then he looked up toward heaven, he sighed \add because he was concerned for the
man\add*, and then \add in his own language\add* he said to the man's
\add ears\add*, “Ephphatha”, which means, “Be opened {Open up}!”.
\v 35 At once the man could hear plainly \f + \fk metonymy \f*. He also began to speak clearly because
\add what was causing him to be unable to speak\add* was healed {Jesus healed
\add what was causing him to be unable to speak\add*}. 
\v 36 Jesus told ◄\add the people/his friends\add*► not to tell anyone
\add what he had done\add*. But, although he ordered them \add and
others\add* repeatedly \add not to tell anyone about it\add*, they kept talking about it very much.
\v 37  \add People who heard about it\add* were utterly amazed and were saying
\add enthusiastically\add*, “Everything he has done is wonderful!
\add Besides doing other amazing things\add*, he enables deaf people to hear! And he enables those who cannot speak to speak!”
