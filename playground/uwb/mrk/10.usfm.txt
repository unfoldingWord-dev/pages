\s MARK 10:1-12 
\s Some Pharisees asked him if the law permitted a man to divorce his wife. Jesus answered and supported his answer from
Scripture. 
\p
\v 1 Jesus left that place\f + \ft Or: Capernaum \f* \add with his disciples\add*, and they went through Judea district and on across
\add to the east side of\add* the Jordan \add River\add*. When crowds gathered around him again, he taught them again, as he
customarily did. 
\v 2  \add While he was teaching them, some\add* Pharisees approached him and asked him, "Does
\add our Jewish\add* law permit a man to divorce his wife?" They asked that in order to be able to criticize him
\add whether he answered "yes" or "no"\add*. 
\v 3 He answered them, "What did Moses command your \add ancestors about a man divorcing his
wife\add*?" 
\v 4  \add One of\add* them replied, "Moses permitted that a man may write on paper
\add his reason\add* for divorcing \add his wife\add*, \add give this paper to
her\add*, and then send her away." 
\v 5 Jesus said to them, "It was because your \add ancestors\add* stubbornly wanted just what they desired that Moses wrote
that law for \add your ancestors\add*, and you \add are just like
them\add*! 
\v 6  \add Remember\add* that he \add also wrote that, when God\add* first created
\add people\add*, he made \add one\add* man, and \add one\add* woman
\add to become that man's wife\add*. 
\v 7 That explains why \add God said\add*, 'When a man \add and\add* woman marry, they should no longer live with their fathers
and mothers \add after they marry\add*. 
\v 8 Instead, the two of them shall \add live together, and they
shall\add* become so\add closely united\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add that they are
like\add* one person.' Therefore, although the people \add who marry\add* were two
\add separate persons\add* before, \add God regards them\add* as one person now,
\add so he wants them to remain married\add*. 
\v 9 Because that is true, a man must not separate from his \add wife\add* whom God has joined
\add to him, because God's plan is for them to remain together\add*!"
\p
\v 10 When Jesus and his disciples were alone in a house, they asked him again about this.
\v 11 He said to them, "\add God considers that a marriage lasts until either the husband or the wife dies, so he
considers\add* that any man who divorces his wife and marries another woman is committing adultery,
\add even\add* if he divorces his first wife. 
\v 12  \add God also considers\add* a woman who divorces her first husband to be committing adultery if she marries another
man." 
\s MARK 10:13-16 
\s Jesus became indignant when he saw his disciples scolding people for bringing children for him to bless them.
\p
\v 13  \add One day\add*, some people were bringing children to Jesus in order that he would touch
\add and bless\add* them. But the disciples scolded those people
\add because they thought that Jesus\add* \add did not want to be bothered spending time with\f + \ft Or: was not concerned
about\add* \f* \add children\add*. 
\v 14 When Jesus saw that, he became angry. He said to the \add disciples\add*, "Allow the children to come to me! Do not
forbid them \f + \ft doublet \f*! It is people who \add are humble and trust as they
do\add* who can experience God's rule \add in their lives\add*\f + \ft Or: God taking care of them \f* \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\v 15 Note this: Those who do not \add trustingly\add* allow God to direct
\add their lives\add*, as children \add do\add*, will not enter the place where God rules."
\v 16 Then he embraced the children. He also put his hands on them
\add and asked God to\add* bless them. 
\s MARK 10:17-31 
\s After a man asked Jesus what he should do in order to live eternally, Jesus told him to sell all his possessions, which
astonished the disciples. 
\p
\v 17 As Jesus was starting to travel \add again with his disciples\add*, a
\add young\add* man ran up to him. He knelt before Jesus and then he asked him, "Good teacher, what must I do to have eternal
life\f + \ft Or: in \f* order to live \add with God\add* eternally?" 
\v 18 Jesus said to him, "You should consider carefully \add what you are
implying\add* (OR\add , that you are implying that I am God\add*)
\add by\add* calling me good, because only God is good!\f + \ft Or: Do you realize
\add what you are implying\add* (OR\add , that you are implying that I am
God\add*) \add by\add* calling me good, because only God is good? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* No other person is good
\v 19  \add But to answer your question\add*, you know the commandments
\add of Moses, which will cause you to live eternally if you obey them
perfectly\add*. He commanded \add things such as\add* 'do not murder anyone, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not
testify falsely\f + \ft Or: lie \f*, do not cheat anyone, and honor your father and mother'."
\v 20 The man said to him, "Teacher, I have obeyed all those commandments ever since I was young.
\add So is\add* \add that enough\f + \ft Or: there something else that I have not
done\add* \f*?" 
\v 21 Jesus looked at him and loved him. He said to him, "There is one thing that you have not
\add yet done\add*. You must go \add home\add*, sell all that you possess, and then give
\add the money\add* to poor people. \add As a result\add*, you will be spiritually rich in heaven. After
\add you have done what I have told you\add*, come with me \add and be my
disciple\add*!" 
\v 22 The man became disappointed when he heard that. He went away sad, because he was very rich
\add and he did not want to give away everything\add*. 
\v 23 Jesus looked around \add at the people\add*. Then he exclaimed to his disciples, "It is very difficult for people who are
wealthy to\add decide to\add* let God rule their lives!" 
\v 24 The disciples were surprised at what he said. \add They thought that God favored the rich people, so if God did not save
them, he would not save anyone\add*. So Jesus replied again to them, "My dear friends, it is very difficult for anyone
\add to decide\add* to let God rule his life. 
\v 25 It is impossible for a camel to go through the eye of a needle. It is almost as difficult \f + \ft hyperbole \f* for rich people
\add to decide\add* to let God rule their \add lives\add*." 
\v 26 The disciples were very astonished. So they said to each other, "If that is so, it will be unlikely that anyone will be
saved {that God will save anyone}!\f + \ft Or: will \add God\add* save anyone? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*"
\v 27 Jesus looked at them and then he said, "\add Yes\add*, it is impossible for people
\add to save themselves!\add* But God certainly can \add save them\add*, because God can do anything!"
\v 28 Peter exclaimed, "\add You know that\add* we have left behind everything and we have become your disciples.
\add So\add*, \add what about us\f + \ft Or: will God 'accept us, Or: reward us'\add* \f*?"
\v 29 Jesus replied, "I want you to know this: Those who have left
\add their\add* houses, \add their\add* brothers, \add their\add* sisters,
\add their\add* father, \add their\add* mother, \add their\add* children, or
\add their\add* plots of ground, to \add be\add* my \add disciples\add* and to
\add proclaim\add* the good news, 
\v 30 will receive in this life a hundred times as much \add as they left behind. That will include houses and people as dear
as\add* brothers and sisters and mothers and children, and plots of ground. Furthermore, although people will persecute them
\add here on earth because they believe in me\add*, in the future age
\add they\add* will \add have\add* eternal life\f + \ft Or: live \add with God\add* eternally \f*.
\v 31 But I \add warn you all\add*: Many of you who \add now consider
yourselves\add* to be very important will be unimportant \add at that future
time\add*, and many of you who \add now consider yourselves\add* to be unimportant will be very important
\add at that future time\add*!" 
\s MARK 10:32-34 
\s As they were traveling toward Jerusalem, Jesus took the disciples aside and began to tell them again about what was going to
happen to him. 
\p
\v 32  \add Some days later as they continued to travel\add*, Jesus and his disciples were walking on the road that leads up to
Jerusalem \add city\add*. Jesus was walking ahead of them. \add The
disciples\f + \ft Or: apostles \f*\add* were astonished \add that he was going to where there were many people who opposed
him\add*, and the other people who were with them were afraid \add about what would happen to him in Jerusalem. Along the way
he took the twelve disciples to a place by themselves\add*. Then he began to tell them again about what was going to happen to
him, saying, 
\v 33 "Listen carefully! We are going up to Jerusalem. There the chief priests and the men who teach the Jewish laws will be
enabled {someone will help the chief priests and those who teach our
\add Jewish\add* laws} to seize me. Then they will declare that I must die,
\add even though\add* I am the one who came from heaven. Then they will take me to the Roman
\add authorities\add*. 
\v 34 Those men will ridicule me. They will spit on me. They will whip me. Then they will kill me. But on the third day after
that, I will become alive again!" 
\s MARK 10:35-45 
\s After James and John requested to sit on the right and left of Jesus when he rules, Jesus told them what will happen and how
they should act. 
\p
\v 35  \add Along the way\add* James and John, \add who were\add* the two sons of Zebedee, approached Jesus and they said to
him, "Teacher, we want you to do for us what we will ask you to do!"
\v 36 He said to them, "What do you want me to do for you?" 
\v 37 They said to him, "When you \add rule\add* gloriously, \add let us rule with
you\add*. Let one of us \add sit\add* at your right side and one sit at your left side."
\v 38 But Jesus said to them, "You do not understand what you are asking for." Then he asked them, "Can you endure suffering
\f + \ft metonymy \f* like I am about to suffer? Can you endure being killed \f + \ft metonymy \f* as I will be killed {people killing you as they will kill
me}?" 
\v 39 They said to him, "\add Yes\add*, we are able \add to do that\add*!" Then Jesus said to them,
"\add It is true that\add* you will endure suffering \f + \ft metonymy \f* like I will suffer, and you will endure being killed as I will be
killed {people killing you as they will kill me}. 
\v 40 But I am not the one who chooses the ones who will sit next to me
\add and rule with me. God will give\add* those places to the ones he appoints."
\p
\v 41 The \add other\add* ten \add disciples later\add* heard about what James and John
\add had requested\add*. As a result, they were angry with them \add because they also wanted to rule with Jesus in the highest
positions\add*. 
\v 42 Then, after Jesus called them all together, he said to them, "You know that those who rule the non-Jews
\add enjoy\add* showing that they are powerful. You also know that officials enjoy commanding others.
\v 43 But do not be like them! On the contrary, all those among you who want
\add God to consider them\add* great must become \add like\add* servants to
\add the rest of\add* you. 
\v 44 Furthermore, if anyone among you wants \add God to consider
him\add* to be the most important, he must \add act like\add* a servant for the rest of you.
\v 45  \add You should imitate me\add*. Even though I am the one who has come from heaven, I did not come to be served {for
others to serve me}. On the contrary, I came in order to serve others and to allow others to kill me, in order that my dying
for people would be like a payment to rescue \add many people from being
punished\add* {\add God punishing them\add*} \add for their sins\add*."
\s MARK 10:46-52 
\s After a blind man called out and asked Jesus to have mercy on him, Jesus healed him.
\p
\v 46  \add On the way to Jerusalem, Jesus and the disciples came to Jericho
town\add*. Afterwards, while they were leaving Jericho along with a great crowd, a blind man who habitually begged
\add for money\add* was sitting beside the road. His name was Bartimaeus and his father's name was Timaeus.
\v 47 When he heard people say that Jesus from Nazareth \add was passing
by\add*, he shouted, "Jesus! \add You who are the Messiah\add* descended from
\add King\add* David, be merciful to\f + \ft Or: help \f* me!" 
\v 48 Many people rebuked him and told him that he should be quiet. But he shouted even more,
"\add You who are the Messiah\add* descended from \add King David\add*, be merciful to\f + \ft Or: help \f* me!"
\v 49 Jesus stopped and said, "Call him \add to come over here\add*!" They summoned the blind man, saying, "Jesus is calling
you! So cheer up and get up \add and come\add*!" 
\v 50 He threw aside his cloak as he jumped up, and he came to Jesus.
\v 51 Jesus asked him, "What do you want me to do for you?" The blind man said to him, "Sir, I
\add want to be able\add* to see again!" 
\v 52 Jesus said to him, "\add I am\add* healing you \add because\add* you believed
\add in me\add*. So you may go \add home\add*!" He could see immediately. And he went with Jesus along the road.
