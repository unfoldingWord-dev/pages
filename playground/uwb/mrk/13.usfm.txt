\c 13  
\s MARK 13:1-2 
\s Jesus prophesied that the Temple would be completely destroyed.
\p
\v 1 While Jesus was leaving the Temple \add area\add*, one of his disciples said to him, “Teacher, look at how marvelous
\add these\add* huge stones \add are\add* and how wonderful \add these\add* buildings
\add are\add*!” 
\v 2 Jesus said to him, “\add Yes\add*, these buildings that you are looking
\add at\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add are wonderful\add*, but I \add want to tell you something
about\add* them. They will be destroyed {\add Foreign invaders\add* will destroy
\add them\add*} \add completely, with the result that\add* no stone here
\add in this Temple area\add* will be left on top of another stone.”
\s MARK 13:3-37 
\s Jesus taught his disciples about the events that will precede his coming again.
\p
\v 3 After they arrived on Olive \add Tree\add* Hill across \add the
valley\add* from the Temple, Jesus sat down. When Peter, James, John, and Andrew were alone with him, they asked him,
\v 4 “Tell us, when will \add that\add* happen \add to the buildings of the Temple? Tell us what will happen that will show us
that all these things that God has planned\add* are about to be finished {that
\add God\add* is about to finish all these things \add that he has
planned\add*}.” 
\v 5 Jesus replied to them, “\add I cannot give you a simple answer to your questions. All I will say
is\add*, beware that no one deceives you \add concerning what will
happen\add*! 
\v 6 Many people will come and say that I sent them\f + \ft Or: that they have my authority \f* \f + \ft metonymy \f*. They will say, ‘I am
\add the Messiah!\add*’ They will deceive many people. 
\v 7 Whenever people tell you about wars \add that are close\add* or wars that are far away, do not be troubled.
\add God has said\add* that those things must happen. \add But when they do happen, do not
think\add* that \add God\add* will finish all \add that he has planned\add* at that time!
\v 8  \add Groups who live in various\add* countries will fight each other, and various governments will fight each other.
There will also be \add big\add* earthquakes in various places; and there will be famines. Yet,
\add when these things happen, people will have only just begun to suffer. The first things that they suffer will be
like\add* the first pains a woman \add suffers\add* who is about to bear a child.
\add They will suffer much more after that\add*. 
\p
\v 9 Be ready for \add what people will do to you at that time\add*. Because
\add you believe in\add* me, they will arrest you and put you on trial before the religious councils. ◄In the synagogue\f + \ft Or: In \f* the
Jewish meeting place►, you will be beaten {others will beat you}. You will be put
{\add People will put\add* you} \add on trial\add* in the presence of high government authorities. As a result, you will be
able to tell them \add about me\add*. 
\v 10 My good message must be proclaimed {\add You\add* must proclaim my good message} to
\add people in\add* all people-groups before \add God finishes all that he has
planned\add*. 
\v 11 And when people arrest you in order to prosecute you \add because you believe in
me\add*, do not worry before that happens about what you will say. Instead, say what
\add God\add* puts into your mind at that time. Then it will not be
\add just\add* you who will be speaking. It will be the Holy Spirit
\add who will be speaking through you\add*. 
\v 12  \add Other evil things will happen\add*: People \add who do not believe in
me\add* will betray\f + \ft Or: help others seize \f* their brothers \add and sisters\add* in order that
\add the government\add* can execute them. Parents \add will betray\add* their children, and children will betray their parents
so that \add the government\add* will kill their parents. 
\v 13  \add In general\add*, you will be hated by most \f + \ft hyperbole \f* people {most \f + \ft hyperbole \f* people will hate you} because
\add you believe in\add* me. But all you who continue \add to trust in me
strongly\add* until your life is finished will be saved {\add God\add* will save all you who continue
\add to trust in me strongly\add* until your life ends}. 
\p
\v 14  \add During that time\add* the disgusting \add thing\f + \ft Or: person \f* that the prophet Daniel
described\add* will enter the Temple. It\f + \ft Or: He \f* will defile \add the Temple when he enters it and will cause people to abandon it.
When you see it\f + \ft Or: him \f* standing there\add* where it\f + \ft Or: he \f* should not be,
\add you should run away quickly\add*! (May everyone who is reading this pay attention to
\add this warning from Jesus\add*!) \add At that time\add* those people who are in Judea
\add district\add* must flee to \add higher\add* hills. 
\v 15 Those people who are outside their houses must not enter their houses in order to get anything
\add before they run away\add*. 
\v 16 Those who are \add working\add* in a field must not return
\add to their houses\add* in order to get \add additional\add* clothes
\add before they flee\add*. 
\v 17 But I feel very sorry for women who will be pregnant and women who will be nursing their babies in those days,
\add because it will be very difficult for them to run away\add*!
\v 18-19 In those days people will suffer very severely. People have never suffered like that since the time when God first
created the world until now; and people will not \add suffer that
way\add* again. \add So\add* pray that \add this painful time\add* will not happen in winter\f + \ft Or: the rainy season \f*,
\add when it will be hard to travel\add*. 
\v 20 If the Lord \add God\add* had not \add decided that he would\add* shorten that time
\add when people suffer so much\add*, everyone would die. But he has
\add decided to\add* shorten that time because \add he is concerned about
you\add* people whom he has chosen \f + \ft doublet \f*. 
\v 21-22  \add At that time people who will\add* falsely \add say that they
are\add* Messiahs and prophets will appear. Then they will perform many kinds ◄of miracles\f + \ft Or: of \f* things that ordinary people
cannot do► \f + \ft doublet \f*. They will even try to deceive \add you\add* people whom God has chosen,
\add but they will not\add* be able to do that. So at that time if someone says to you, ‘Look, here is the Messiah!’ or
\add if someone says\add*, ‘Look, there he is!’ do not believe it!
\v 23 Be alert! Remember that\add I\add* have warned you about all this before
\add it happens\add*! 
\p
\v 24 After the time when people suffer like that, the sun will become dark, the moon will not shine,
\v 25 the stars will fall from the sky, and all things in the sky will be shaken
{\add God will cause\add* all things in the sky to shake}. 
\v 26 Then people will see \add me\add*, the one who came from heaven, coming through the clouds powerfully and gloriously.
\v 27 Then I will send out my angels in order that they gather together the people whom
\add God\add* has chosen from \add everywhere, and that includes\add* all the most remote places on earth \f + \ft idiom, doublet \f*.
\p
\v 28 Now I \add want you to\add* learn something from this parable about
\add the way\add* fig trees \add grow\add*. \add In this area\add*, when their branches become tender and their leaves begin to
sprout, you know that summer is near. 
\v 29 Similarly, when you see \add what I have just described\add* happening, you yourselves will know that it is very near
\add the time for me to return\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*. \add It will be as though I
am\add* already at the door \f + \ft hendiadys \f*. 
\v 30 Keep this in mind: You have observed the things that I have done and said, but all of those events
\add that I have just told you about\add* will happen before all of you will die.
\v 31 You can \add be certain that\add* these things \add that I have
prophesied\add* will happen. \add You can be more certain of that
than\add* you can \add be certain that\add* the earth and what is in the sky will stay in place.
\v 32 But no one knows the exact time \add when I will return\add*. The angels in heaven also do not know. Even
\add I, God's\add* son, do not know. Only my Father knows. 
\v 33 So be ready, \add like people who are waiting for an important man to
come\add*, because you do not know when that time will come \add when all these events will
happen!\add* 
\v 34 When a man who wants to travel \add to a distant place\add* is
\add about to\add* leave his house, he tells his servants that they should manage the house.
\add He tells\add* each one what he should do. Then he tells the doorkeeper to be ready
\add for his return\add*. 
\v 35  \add That man must always be\add* ready, \add because he does not know
whether\add* his master will return in the evening, at midnight, when the rooster crows, or at dawn.
\add Similarly\add*, you also must \add always\add* be ready, because you do not know
\add when I will return\add*. 
\v 36  \add May it not happen that\add* when I come suddenly, I will find that you are not ready!
\v 37 These words that I am saying to you \add disciples\add* I am saying to everyone
\add who believes in me: Always\add* be ready!” \add That is what Jesus warned his
disciples\add*.
