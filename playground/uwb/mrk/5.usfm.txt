\c 5  
\s MARK 5:1-20 
\s Jesus expelled evil spirits from a Gerasene man and then allowed them to enter a herd of pigs, which then ran down a hill
and drowned. As a result, the local people asked Jesus to leave the area.
\p
\v 1 Jesus and his disciples arrived on the \add east\add* side of Lake
\add Galilee. They landed near\add* where the Gerasene \add people
lived\add*. 
\v 2 There was a man in that region whom evil spirits controlled.
\v 3  \add Because that man was violent and people were afraid of
him\add*, they had tied him up many times. \add As he grew more violent\add*, no one was able to tie him up any longer, not
even with chains, 
\v 4 because the chains would be broken by him {he would break the chains} whenever he was bound {they bound him} with them.
The iron shackles would also be smashed by him {He would also smash the iron shackles} whenever they were fastened {they
fastened them} \add on his feet\add*. 
\v 5 He lived in one of the caves \add where they bury dead people\add*. During both night and day he would scream among the
caves and in the hills. He would also cut himself with \add sharp\add* stones.
\add That day\add* he came out of the caves. 
\v 6 As Jesus \add and his disciples got\add* out of the boat, that man saw Jesus from a distance. He immediately ran to Jesus,
and then he knelt before him. 
\v 7-8 Jesus had been saying to the evil spirit, “You evil spirit, come out of this man!”
\add But the demon did not leave quickly\add*. It shouted very loudly, “Jesus, I
\add know that you are the\add* Son of God, so ◄we have nothing in common.\f + \ft Or: what \f* do we have in common?► [IDM, RHQ]
\add So leave me alone\add*! I ask you to promise, knowing God is listening, that you will not torture me
\add now\add*!” 
\v 9  \add So, in order to expel the demon more easily\add*, Jesus asked him, “What is your name?” He replied, “My name is
Crowd\f + \ft Or: Mob \f* because there are many of us \add evil spirits in this
man\add*.” 
\v 10 Then the evil spirits fervently kept begging Jesus that he not send them out of the region.
\v 11  \add At the same time\add*, a large herd of pigs was ◄grazing\f + \ft Or: rooting \f* for food► nearby on the hillside.
\v 12 So the evil spirits pleaded with Jesus, “Allow us to go to the pigs in order that we might enter them!”
\v 13 He permitted them \add to do that\add*. So the evil spirits left the man and entered the pigs. The herd,
\add which numbered\add* about 2000, rushed down the cliff into the lake, and then they drowned in the lake.
\p
\v 14 The men who were tending the pigs ran and reported in the town and the countryside
\add what had happened. Many people\add* went to see what had happened.
\v 15 They came to \add the place where\add* Jesus \add was\add*. Then they saw the man whom evil spirits had
\add previously\add* controlled. He was sitting there with clothes on and mentally sound.
\add As a result\add*, they became afraid \add because they thought that he might destroy more of their
property\add*. \f + \ft (OR, \add they realized that Jesus must be very powerful\add*.)
\v 16 The people who had seen what had happened described what had happened to the man whom the evil spirits
\add previously\add* controlled. They also described \add what had happened
to\add* the pigs. 
\v 17 Then the people pleaded with Jesus to leave their region. 
\p
\v 18 As Jesus got in the boat \add in order to leave\add*, the man whom the evil spirits
\add previously\add* controlled begged Jesus, “\add Please let me\add* go with you!”
\v 19 But Jesus did not let him \add go with him\add*. On the contrary, he said to him, “Go home to your family and tell them
how much the Lord \add God\add* has done for you, and tell them how
\add God\add* was kind to you.” 
\v 20 So the man went \add and traveled around\add* the Ten Towns
\add district\add*. He told people how much Jesus had done for him. All the people
\add who heard what the man said\add* were amazed. 
\s MARK 5:21-43 
\s Jesus cured a woman who had been suffering from hemorrhaging and brought Jairus' daughter back to life.
\p
\v 21 Jesus \add and his disciples\add* went in a boat back around Lake
\add Galilee\add* to where they were before. When they arrived at the shore of the lake, a large crowd gathered around Jesus.
\v 22 One of the men who presided over a ◄synagogue\f + \ft Or: Jewish \f* meeting place►, whose name was Jairus, came there. When he saw
Jesus, he prostrated himself at his feet. 
\v 23 Then he pleaded with Jesus earnestly, “My daughter is \add sick
and\add* nearly dead! \add Please\add* come \add to my house\add* and place your hands on her in order that she will be healed
{to heal her}, so that she will not die!” 
\v 24 So Jesus \add and the disciples\add* went with him. 
\p A large crowd followed \add Jesus\add* and \add many\add* pushed close to him.
\v 25 There was a woman \add in the crowd\add* who had vaginal bleeding \\f + \\ft euphemism \\f*
\add every day\add* for twelve years. 
\v 26 She had suffered much while many doctors\add treated her\add*. But although she had spent all
\add her money\add* to pay the doctors, she had not been helped {they had not helped her}. Instead, she had become worse \\f + \\ft euphemism \\f*.
\v 27 After she heard that Jesus \add healed people\add*, she came
\add to where he was and pushed\add* in the crowd\add close\add* behind Jesus.
\v 28 She did that because she was thinking, “If I \add touch him
or\add* even if I touch his clothes, I will be healed {his power will heal me}.” So she touched Jesus' clothes.
\v 29 At once her bleeding stopped. At the same time, she sensed within herself that she had been cured of {that
\add he\add* had cured} her illness. 
\v 30 Jesus \add also\add* immediately sensed within himself that his power had healed someone. So he turned around in the
crowd and then he asked, “Who touched my clothes?” 
\v 31  \add One of\add* his disciples replied, “You can see that many people are crowding close to you!
\add Probably many people touched you\add*! So ◄why do you ask ‘Who touched
me?’\add \f + \ft Or: we \f* are surprised\add* that you ask ‘Who touched me?’ \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f*►”
\v 32 But Jesus kept looking around in order to see the one who had done it.
\v 33 The woman was very afraid and trembling. \add She thought that Jesus might be angry because she had violated the law that
women who had such a\add* sickness\add should not touch other people.
But\add* she knew \add that Jesus had healed her\add*. So she prostrated herself before him. Then she told him truthfully
\add about what she had done\add*. 
\v 34 He said to her, “◄Ma'am\f + \ft Or: Young \f* lady►, because you have believed
\add that I could heal you\add*, I have \add now\add* healed you. You may go home with peace
\add in your heart\add*, \add because I promise that\add* you will not be sick
\add this way anymore\add*.” 
\p
\v 35 While Jesus was still speaking \add to that woman\add*, some people arrived who had come from Jairus' house. They said
\add to Jairus\add*, “Your daughter has \add now\add* died. So ◄it is useless that you bother the teacher any longer
\add by urging him to go to your house\add*!\f + \ft Or: why \f* do you bother the teacher any longer
\add by urging him to go to your house\add*?► \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f*” 
\v 36 But when Jesus heard what these men said, he said to Jairus, “Do not think that the situation is hopeless! Just keep
believing \add that she will live!\add*” 
\v 37-38 Then he allowed only \add his three closest disciples\add*, Peter, James, and John, to go with him
\add to Jairus' house\add*. He did not allow any other people to go with him. After they arrived near the house, Jesus saw that
the people there were in turmoil. They were weeping and wailing \\f + \\ft doublet \\f* loudly.
\v 39 He entered the house and then he said to them, knowing that
\add he was going to cause her to live again\add*, “◄Do not make such a disturbance!\f + \ft Or: Why \f* are you making such a disturbance?►
\\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* Stop crying, for the child is not dead! On the contrary, she is
\add only\add* sleeping [HYP, EUP]!” 
\v 40 The people laughed at him, \add because they knew that she was
dead\add*. But he sent all the other people outside the house. Then he took the child's father and mother and the
\add three disciples\add* who were with him. He went into \add the
room\add* where the child was \add lying\add*. 
\v 41 He took hold of the child's hand and said to her \add in her own
language\add*, “Talitha, Koum!” That means, “Little girl, get up!”
\v 42 At once the girl got up and walked around. (\add It was not surprising that she could
walk\add*, because she was twelve years old.) \f* \add When this happened, all who were
present\add* were very astonished. 
\v 43 Jesus ordered them strictly, “Do not tell anyone about \add what I have
done!\add*” Afterwards he told them that something to eat should be brought to her {that they should bring her something to
eat}.
