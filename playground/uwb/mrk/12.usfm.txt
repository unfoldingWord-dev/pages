\s MARK 12:1-12 
\s After Jesus told the Jewish leaders a parable, they realized that he was accusing them of wanting to kill him, but they
feared how the people would react if they arrested Jesus. 
\p
\v 1 Then Jesus told \add those Jewish leaders\add* a parable. \add He wanted to show what God would do to those who rejected
the former prophets and himself. He said\add*, “A certain man planted a vineyard. He built a fence around it
\add in order to protect it\add*. He made a stone tank \add to collect the juice
that\add* they would press \add out of the grapes\add*. He also built a tower
\add for someone to sit in to guard his vineyard\add*. Then he leased the vineyard to some men to care for it and
\add to\add* give him some of the \add grapes\add* in return. Then he went away to another country.
\v 2 When the time came to harvest the \add grapes\add*, he sent a servant to the men
\add who were taking care of the vineyard\add* in order to receive from them his share of the grapes that the vineyard had
produced. 
\v 3 But \add after the servant arrived\add*, they grabbed him and beat him, and they did not give him any fruit. Then they
sent him away. 
\v 4 Later the one who owned the vineyard sent another servant to them. But they bashed the head of that one, and they insulted
him. 
\v 5 Later he sent another servant. That man they killed. They mistreated many other servants
\add whom he sent\add*. Some they beat and some they killed. 
\v 6 The man still had one other \add person with him\add*. He had with him his son whom he loved very much. So, finally he
sent his son to them because he thought that they would respect him
\add and give him some of the grapes\add*. 
\v 7 But \add when they saw his son coming\add*, those men who were looking after the vineyard said to each other, ‘Look! Here
comes the man who will some day inherit the vineyard! So let's kill him in order that this vineyard will be ours!’
\v 8 They seized him and killed him. Then they threw his body outside the vineyard.
\v 9 So ◄do you know what the man who owns the vineyard will do?/I will tell you what the man who owns the vineyard will do
\f + \fr rhetorical question \f*►. He will come, and he will kill those evil men who were taking care of his vineyard. Then he will arrange for other
people to take care of it. 
\v 10  \add Now think carefully about these words\add*, which you have read
\add in\add* the Scriptures: 
\p The men who were building the building rejected one stone. But others
\add put that same stone in its proper place, and\add* it has become the most important stone in the building \f + \fr metaphor \f*!
\v 11 The Lord has done this, and we marvel as we look at it.” 
\p
\v 12 Then \add the Jewish leaders\add* realized that he was accusing them when he told this story
\add about what those wicked people did\add*. So they wanted to seize him. But they were afraid of what the crowds
\add would do if they did that\add*. So they left him and went away.
\s MARK 12:13-17 
\s Jesus foiled the Jewish leaders' attempt to trap him by their question of whether they should pay taxes to the Roman
government. 
\p
\v 13 The \add Jewish leaders\add* sent to \add Jesus\add* some Pharisees
\add who thought that the Jews should pay only the tax that their own Jewish authorities required people to
pay\add*. They also sent some members of the party that supported Herod
\add Antipas and the Roman government\add*. They wanted to make Jesus say something wrong
\add that would make one of those groups very angry with him\add*.
\v 14 After they arrived, they said to him \add deceivingly\add*, “Teacher, we know that you
\add teach\add* the truth. We also know that you are not concerned about
\add what\add* people \add say about you, even if an important person does not like what you
say\add*. Instead, you teach truthfully what God wants \add us to
do\add*. So \add tell us what you think about this matter:\add* Is it right that we pay taxes to the Roman government, or not
\f + \fr metonymy \f*? Should we pay the taxes, or should we not pay them?” 
\v 15 Jesus knew that they did not really want to know \add what God wanted them to
do\add*. So he said to them, “◄I \add know that\add* you are \add just\add* trying to make me say something wrong for which you
can arrest me./Why are you \add just\add* trying to make me say something wrong for which you can arrest me?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*
\add But I will answer your question anyway\add*. Bring me a coin so that I might
\add ask you something after\add* I look at it.” 
\v 16 After they brought him a coin, he asked them, “Whose picture is
\add on\add* this \add coin\add*? And \add whose\add* name \add is on
it\add*?” They replied, “It is a picture and the name of Caesar,
\add the man who rules the Roman government\add*.” 
\v 17 Then Jesus said to them, “\add That is correct, so\add* give to the government \f + \fr metonymy \f* what they
\add require\add*, and give to God what he \add requires\add*.” They were
\add frustrated at his answer but\add* amazed at what he said, \add because they were not able to accuse him because of what he
said\add*. 
\s MARK 12:18-27 
\s Jesus showed from Scripture that the Sadducees were wrong in ridiculing the idea of life after death.
\p
\v 18  \add Men who belong to the\add* Sadducee \add sect\add* deny that people become alive again after they die.
\add In order to discredit\add* Jesus \add by ridiculing the idea that people will live again, some
of\add* them came to him and asked him, 
\v 19 “Teacher, Moses wrote for us \add Jews\add* that if a man who has no children dies, his brother should marry the dead
man's widow. \add Then if those two bear children, everyone will consider that those children are
the\add* children of the man who died, \add and in that way the dead man will continue to have
descendants\add*. 
\v 20  \add So here is an example\add*. There were seven boys \add in one
family\add*. The oldest one married \add a woman\add*, but \add he and his
wife\add* did not bear any children. Then he \add later\add* died.
\v 21 The second \add brother followed this law and\add* married that woman and he, too, did not bear any children. Then he
\add later\add* died. The third \add brother did\add* like \add his other brothers did. But he also did not bear any children,
and later died\add*. 
\v 22 Eventually all seven \add brothers married that woman one by
one\add*, but they had no children and one by one they died. Afterwards the woman died, too.
\v 23 Therefore, \add if it were true what some people say, that people will become alive again after they
die\add*, whose wife do you think that woman will be when people become alive again?
◄\add Keep in mind that\add* she was married to all seven \add brothers\add*!/She was married to all seven
\add brothers, so how can anyone decide\add* \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*?►” 
\v 24 Jesus replied to them, “You are certainly wrong \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*. You do not know
\add what they have written in\add* the Scriptures \add about this\add*. You also do not understand God's
power\add to make people alive again\add*. 
\v 25  \add That woman will not be the wife of any of them\add* because when people have become alive again, instead of men
having wives and women having husbands, they will be like the angels in heaven,
\add who do not marry\add*. 
\v 26 But as to people becoming alive again after they die, in the book that Moses
\add wrote, he said something about people who have died\add* that I am sure that you have read \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*. When Moses
\add was looking at\add* the bush \add that was burning\add*, God said to him, ‘I am the God whom Abraham
\add worships\add* and the God whom Isaac \add worships\add* and the God whom Jacob
\add worships\add*.’ 
\v 27 It is not dead people who worship God. It is living people who worship him.
\add Abraham, Isaac and Jacob died long before Moses lived, but God said that they were still worshipping him, so we know their
spirits were still alive!\add* So your \add claim that dead people do not become alive
again\add* is very wrong.” 
\s MARK 12:28-34 
\s Jesus commended a scribe who accepted Jesus' assessment of the two greatest commandments, after which they asked Jesus no
more questions to trap him. 
\p
\v 28 A man who taught the \add Jewish\add* laws heard their discussion. He knew that Jesus answered the question well. So he
stepped forward and asked Jesus, “Which commandment is the most important?”
\v 29 Jesus answered, “The most important commandment is this: ‘Listen,
\add you people of\add* Israel! \add You must worship\add* the Lord, our God, our only Lord.
\v 30  \add You must show that you love him in all the ways that you
live\add*! Show it in all that you want and feel, in all that you think, and in all that you do!’
\v 31 The next \add most important commandment\add* is: ‘You must love people you come in contact with as much as you love
yourself.’ No other commandment is more important than these two!”
\v 32 The man said to Jesus, “Teacher, \add you have answered\add* well. You correctly said that he is the only
\add God\add* and that there is no other God \add we must worship/obey\add*.
\v 33 You have also said correctly that we ◄\add should/must show that
we\add*► love God by all that we are, by all that we think, and by the way that we live. And you have said correctly that we
must love ◄people with whom we come in contact/others► as much as we love ourselves. And you have also correctly said that
doing these things \add pleases God\add* more than offering/giving animals to him or burning
\add other\add* sacrifices.” 
\v 34 Jesus realized that this man had answered wisely. So he said to him,
“\add I perceive that\add* you will soon \add decide to let\add* God rule your life.” After that,
\add the Jewish leaders\add* were afraid to ask him any more questions
\add like that to try to trap him\add*. 
\s MARK 12:35-37 
\s Jesus showed from Scripture that the Messiah must be David's Lord as well as his descendant.
\p
\v 35  \add Later\add*, while he was teaching in the Temple \add courtyard\add*, Jesus said
\add to the people\add*, “These men who teach the \add Jewish\add* laws, ◄they must be wrong when they say that the Messiah is
\add merely\add* a descendant of \add King\add* David!/why do they say that the Messiah is
\add merely\add* a descendant of \add King\add* David?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* 
\v 36 The Holy Spirit caused David himself to say \add about the
Messiah\add*, 
\q God said to my Lord, ‘Sit here beside me at the place where I will highly honor you! Sit here while I completely defeat your
enemies! \f + \fr metonymy \f*’ 
\p
\v 37 Therefore, \add because\add* David himself calls \add the Messiah\add* ‘my Lord,’ ◄the Messiah cannot be
\add just\add* a man who descended \add from King David!\add*/how can the Messiah be
\add just\add* a man who descended \add from King David\add*?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*
\add He must be much greater than David!\add*” Many people listened to him gladly
\add as he taught those things\add*. 
\s MARK 12:38-40 
\s Jesus warned them about the scribes' hypocritical actions. 
\p
\v 38 While Jesus was teaching \add the people\add*, he said to them, “Beware that you
\add do not act like\add* the men who teach our \add Jewish\add* laws. They
\add like people to honor them, so\add* they put on long robes and walk around
\add in order to show people how important they are\add*. They also like people to greet them
\add respectfully\add* in the marketplaces. 
\v 39  \add They like to sit\add* in the most important seats in our ◄synagogue/Jewish meeting place►. At festivals,
\add they like to sit in\add* the seats where the most honored people sit.
\v 40 They ◄swindle/take for themselves► the houses \add and property\add* of widows by cheating them.
\add Then\add* they pretend \add that they are good\add* by praying long prayers
\add publicly. God\add* will certainly punish them severely!” 
\s MARK 12:41-44 
\s Jesus told them that a poor widow's tiny sacrificial offering was worth more in God's sight than large amounts of money from
rich people. 
\p
\v 41  \add Later\add*, Jesus sat down \add in the Temple courtyard opposite the boxes in which people put offerings. As he was
sitting there\add*, he watched as all the people put money in the box. Many rich people put in large amounts
\add of money\add*. 
\v 42 Then a poor widow came along and put in two small copper coins, which had a very small value.
\v 43-44 He gathered his disciples around him and said to them, “The truth is that these other people have a lot of money,
\add but\add* they gave \add only a small part of it\add*. But this woman, who is very poor, has put in all the money that she
had to pay for the things she needs. \add So God considers that\add* this poor widow has put more money into the box than all
the other people!”
