\c 4  
\s MARK 4:1-25 
\s Jesus taught the crowds by parables about the various ways that people who hear his message react.
\p
\v 1 Another time Jesus began to teach \add people\add* alongside Lake
\add Galilee. As he was doing that, a very large crowd gathered around him. Because people were jostling
him\add*, he got into a boat in the lake\add so that he could speak to the crowd better. Then he sat in it in order that he
could teach the crowd from the boat\add*. At the same time, the crowd was on the shore close to the lake.
\v 2 Then he taught them many parables. While he was teaching them, he told them
\add this\add*: 
\v 3 “Consider \add well the meaning of this illustration\add*: A man/farmer went out
\add to his field\add* to sow \add some seeds\add*. 
\v 4 As he was scattering them \add over the soil\add*, some \add of
the\add* seeds fell on the path. Then some birds came and ate those seeds.
\v 5 Other \add seeds\add* fell on ground where there was not much soil
\add on top of\add* the rock. Very soon the \add seeds\add* sprouted because
\add the sun warmed\add* the moist soil quickly where it was not deep.
\v 6 But after the sun shone \add on those young plants\add*, they became scorched. Then they withered because they did not
have \add deep\add* roots. 
\v 7 As he sowed, other \add seeds\add* fell on \add ground that contained roots
of\add* thorny plants. \add The\add* seeds \add grew, but\add* the thorny plants also grew up and crowded out
\add the\add* good \add plants. So the plants\add* produced no grain.
\v 8 But as he sowed, other \add seeds\add* fell on good soil. As a result, they sprouted, they grew well, and then they
produced \add plenty of\add* grain. \add Some\add* plants bore 30
\add grains\add*. \add Some\add* bore 60 \add grains\add*. \add Some\add* bore 100
\add grains\add*.” 
\v 9 Then Jesus said, “If you want to understand this \f + \fr metonymy \f*, you should consider
\add carefully what I have just said\add*.” 
\p
\v 10  \add Later\add*, when only the twelve \add disciples\add* and a few
\add other\add* people were with him, they asked him about the parables.
\v 11 He said to them, “People have not understood before \add the new
message\add* about how God wants to rule people's lives. It is to you that this is being made known {that I am making this
known}. But I tell about this \add only\add* ◄in parables/figuratively► to those who have not
\add yet invited God to rule their lives\add*. 
\v 12 As a result \add it is true what a prophet has written\add*,
\q Although they see \add what I do\add*, they do not perceive \add what it
means\add* \f + \fr doublet \f*. Although they hear \add what I say\add*, they do not understand
\add what it means\add* \f + \fr doublet \f*. So they do not ◄repent/turn away from their sinful behavior► in order that they would be
forgiven {\add God\add* would forgive them}.” 
\p
\v 13 He also said to them, “◄\add I am disappointed that\add* you do not understand this illustration!/Can you not understand
this illustration?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* \add If you do not understand\add* this, ◄you will certainly not understand any of the
\add other\add* illustrations!/how will you understand any of the
\add other\add* illustrations?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* \add Nevertheless, I will explain it to
you\add*. 
\v 14  \add In the illustration that I told you\add*, the man who sows
\add seeds represents someone who\add* declares God's message \f + \fr doublet \f*.
\v 15  \add Some people are like\add* the path on which \add some
of\add* the seeds fell. When they hear \add the message\add*, Satan comes at once and causes them to forget what they have
heard. 
\v 16  \add Some people are like the ground where the soil was not very deep
over\add* the rock. When they hear \add God's\add* message, they immediately accept it with joy.
\v 17 But, because \add the message does not penetrate deeply\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f*
\add into their hearts/inner beings, they\add* believe it for \add only a short time. They are like the plants
that\add* did not have deep roots. When others treat such people badly or cause them to suffer because
\add they believe\add*, those people \add who are suffering\add* soon stop believing God's message.
\v 18  \add Some people are like\add* the \add soil that had roots
of\add* thorny weeds in it. \add Although\add* those people hear
\add God's\add* message, 
\v 19 they desire to be rich, and they desire to own many other things. So they worry
\add only\add* about material things. The result is that they forget
\add God's\add* message and they do not do \add the things that God wants them to
do\add*. 
\v 20  \add But some people\add* are like the good soil. They hear
\add God's\add* message and they accept it \add and they believe\add* it,
\add they do the things that God wants them to do. They are like the good plants that
produced\add* 30, 60 or 100 \add grains\add*.” 
\p
\v 21 He also told them \add another parable\add*, saying, “◄People certainly do not
\add light\add* an oil lamp and then bring it \add in the house\add* in order that it may be put {someone may put it} under a
container or under a bed./Would anyone \add light\add* an oil lamp and then bring it
\add in the house\add* in order that it may be put {someone may put it} under a container or under a bed?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* ◄No,
\add they light it\add* in order that it may be put {someone may put it} in a place
\add where it lights the house\add*.\add /Wouldn't they light it\add* in order that it may be put {someone may put it} in a
place \add where it lights the house\add*?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* 
\v 22  \add Similarly\add*, there are some \add parts of God's message\add* that people do not know.
\add But he intends that\add* people will understand all the things that they do not know
\add now\add*. 
\v 23 If you want to understand this, you should consider\add carefully\add* what you
\add have just heard\add*.” 
\p
\v 24 Then he said to them, “Consider carefully what you hear \add me say to
you\add*, for \add God\add* will let you \add understand\add* to the same degree that you
\add consider what I say\add*. \add He\add* will let you \add understand\add* even more than that.
\v 25 Those who \add consider what I say\add* and understand it,
\add God\add* will enable them to understand more. But those who do not
\add consider carefully what I say\add*, they will forget even what they already know.”
\s MARK 4:26-34 
\s Jesus told them two parables to show them how the number of people who will submit to God's rule over their lives will
greatly increase. 
\p
\v 26 Jesus also said, “God \add has the power to change\add* people who let him rule their lives. I
\add will illustrate how that can happen\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f*. A man planted seeds in the ground.
\v 27 Afterwards he slept each night and rose each day \add without worrying about the
seeds\add*. \add During that time\add* the seeds sprouted and grew in a way that he did not understand, because by itself the
soil \add caused the plants to grow and produce grain\add*. 
\v 28 First the stalks \add appeared\add*. Then the heads \add appeared\add*. Then the full kernels in the heads
\add appeared\add*. 
\v 29 As soon as the grain was ripe he sent \add people\add* \f + \fr metonymy \f* to harvest it because it was time to harvest
\add the grain\add*.” 
\p
\v 30  \add Jesus told them\add* another\add parable. He\add* said, “I will tell you \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* how the
\add number of people\add* whose lives God rules in a new way \add will continue to
grow\add* \f + \fr (OR, each continue to have more and more influence in this world) \f*. I hope \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* that this illustration will show this
\add to you\add*. 
\v 31  \add You know what happens to\add* mustard seeds when we plant them. Though mustard seeds are among the smallest of
seeds, \add here in Israel\add* they become large plants. 
\v 32 After they are planted, they grow up and become larger than the other garden plants. They put out big branches so that
birds are able to make nests in their shade.” 
\p
\v 33 Jesus used many such illustrations when he talked to the people about God. If they were able to understand
\add some, he kept telling them more\add*. 
\v 34 He always used parables when he spoke to them. But he explained all
\add the illustrations\add* to his own disciples when he was alone with them.
\s MARK 4:35-41 
\s While Jesus and his disciples crossed the sea in a boat and while Jesus slept, a storm arose, so the disciples woke him and
he calmed the storm. 
\p
\v 35 On that same day, when the sun was setting, Jesus said to \add his
disciples\add*, “Let's cross over to the opposite side of \add Lake Galilee in the
boat\add*.” 
\v 36 So they left the crowd, \add got in\add* the boat where Jesus
\add already\add* was, and left. \add Other people\add* went with them in other boats.
\v 37 A strong wind came up and the waves started coming into the boat! The boat was soon nearly full
\add of water!\add* 
\v 38 Jesus was in the back part of the boat. He was sleeping, \add with his
head\add* on a cushion. So they woke him up and said to him, “Teacher! ◄You ought to be concerned that we are about to
perish!/Are you not concerned that we are about to perish?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*”
\v 39 So Jesus got up and rebuked the wind. Then he said to the lake, “Be quiet! Be still! \f + \fr doublet \f*” The wind stopped blowing and
then \add the lake\add* became very calm. 
\v 40 He said to the disciples, “◄\add I am disappointed that\add* you are afraid
\add like that\add*!/Why are you afraid \add like that\add*?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* Do you not yet believe
\add that I can protect you\add*?” 
\v 41 They were very awestruck. They said to one another, “◄What kind of man is he?/This man
is\add not like ordinary\add* men!► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* \add Not only do the demons obey him,
but\add* even the wind and the waves obey him!”
