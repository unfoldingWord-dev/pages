\v 1-2 ◄\add This is/I want to tell you\add*► the good message about Jesus Christ, the Son of God \f + \fr (OR, the man who was also
God) \f*. \add What I want to tell you\add* begins just like the prophet Isaiah
\add said it would begin, when\add* he wrote \add these words that God said to his
Son:\add* 
\q Listen! I am sending my messenger ahead of you. He will prepare
\add people for\add* your\add coming\add*. 
\v 3 He will call out to people \add who pass by where he is\add* in the desolate area, “As people straighten out pathways
\add before an important official arrives\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f*, make\add yourselves\add* ready \f + \fr doublet \f*
\add in order that you will be prepared when\add* the Lord \add comes\add*.”
\p
\v 4  \add The messenger that Isaiah predicted was\add* John. \add People called
him\add* ‘The Baptizer’. In the desolate area near the Jordan River he kept telling people, “If you want God to forgive you for
having sinned, you must turn away from your sinful behavior \add before you ask me
to\add* baptize\add you\add*.” 
\v 5 A great number \f + \fr hyperbole \f* of people who lived in Jerusalem \add city\add* and
\add elsewhere\add* in the Judea \add district\add* were going out to where John was. There,
\add after hearing John's message\add*, they \add responded by\add* confessing the sinful things
\add that they had done\add*. Then they were being baptized by John {John was baptizing them} in the Jordan River.
\v 6 John wore \add rough\add* clothes made of camel's hair. And
\add as the prophet Elijah had done\add*, he wore a leather belt around his waist; and what he ate was
\add only\add* grasshoppers and honey \add that he found\add* in that desolate area.
\v 7 He was preaching, “Very shortly a man will come who is very great. I
\add am nothing compared to him. Because he is so superior to me\add*, I am not even worthy to
\add serve him like a slave\add* by stooping down and untying his sandals.
\v 8 I used \add only\add* water when I baptized you \add because you said that you wanted to change your
lives\add*, but he will put his Holy Spirit \add within\add* you
\add to truly change your lives\add*.” 
\s Mark 1:9-13 
\s God showed Jesus to be the Son of God by God's Spirit descending upon him; by Himself, God the Father, declaring it; by
Satan testing him; and by the angels taking care of him. 
\p
\v 9 During that time \add when John was preaching\add*, Jesus came from Nazareth
\add town\add*, which is in Galilee \add district\add*. He went to
\add where John was preaching\add* and he was baptized by John {John baptized him} in the Jordan
\add River\add*. 
\v 10 Immediately after \add Jesus\add* came up out of the water, he saw heaven opened up
\add and he saw\add* the Spirit \add of God\add* descending on himself. He came in the form of a dove.
\v 11 And \add God\add* \f + \fr metonymy \f* spoke to him from heaven saying, “You are my Son, the one whom I love dearly. I am very pleased
with you.” 
\v 12 ◄Then/Right away► the Spirit \add of God\add* sent Jesus into the desolate area.
\v 13 He was there for forty days. During that time, he was tempted by Satan {Satan tempted him}. There were wild animals
\add there\add* also. But angels took care of him. 
\s Mark 1:14-15 
\s After John was arrested, Jesus came and preached the good message that came from God.
\p
\v 14 Later, after John was put in prison {after \add soldiers\add* put John in prison}
\add because he had rebuked the governor Herod Antipas for his sins\add*, Jesus went to Galilee
\add district\add*. There he was preaching the good message \add that
came\add* from God. 
\v 15 He was repeatedly saying, “Now is the time when God will begin to rule people's lives
\add in a new way\add*. \add So\add* turn away from your sinful behavior! Believe the good message
\add in order\add* ◄\add to belong to him/to become those whose lives he will
rule\add*►!” 
\s Mark 1:16-20 
\s Jesus showed his authority when he summoned four men, and they immediately went with him.
\p
\v 16  \add One day\add*, while Jesus was walking along by Galilee lake, he saw
\add two men\add*, Simon and Simon's \add younger\add* brother, Andrew. They were casting their
\add fishing\add* net into the lake. They \add earned money by\add* catching
\add and selling\add* fish. 
\v 17 Then Jesus said to them, “\add Just like you have been\add* gathering fish, come with me and I will
\add teach\add* you how to \add gather people to become my disciples\add*” \f + \fr metaphor \f*.
\v 18 Immediately they abandoned \add the work that they were doing
with\add* their nets, and they went with him. 
\v 19 After they had gone on a little further, Jesus saw \add two other
men\add*, James and James' \add younger\add* brother, John. They were the sons of
\add a man named\add* Zebedee. They were both in a boat mending \add fishing\add* nets.
\v 20 As soon as Jesus saw them, he told them that\add they should leave their work and to come with
him\add*. So they left their father, \add who remained\add* in the boat with the hired servants, and they went away with Jesus.
\s Mark 1:21-28 
\s People were amazed as a result of Jesus expelling a demon from a man.
\p
\v 21  \add Later\add* Jesus \add and those disciples\add* arrived at Capernaum
\add town\add*. On the next ◄Sabbath/Jewish rest day►, after Jesus had entered ◄the synagogue/the Jewish meeting place►, he
began teaching \add the people who had gathered there\add*. 
\v 22 They were continually amazed at the way he taught. \add He
did\add* not \add just teach what others had taught\add*, like the men who teach the
\add Jewish\add* laws did. \add They habitually just repeated what other people had
taught\add*. Instead, he taught with \add his own\add* authority.
\v 23 Suddenly, \add while he was teaching\add*, a man \add appeared\add* in their worship place who had an evil spirit in him,
and he shouted, 
\v 24 “Jesus, from Nazareth \add town, since\add* we \add evil spirits\add* have nothing in common with you,
◄\add do not interfere with us\add*!/what do you want with us \add evil
spirits\add*?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* ◄Do not destroy us \add now\add*!/Have you come to destroy us
\add now\add*?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* I know who you are. I know that you are the holy one
\add who has come\add* from God!” 
\v 25 Jesus rebuked \add the evil spirit\add*, saying, “Be quiet! And come out
\add of the man\add*!” 
\v 26 The evil spirit shook the man hard. He screamed loudly, and then he came out of the man
\add and left\add*. 
\v 27 All \add the people who were there\add* were amazed. As a result, they discussed this among themselves,
\add exclaiming\add*, “◄This is \add amazing\add*!/What is this?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* Not only does he teach in a new and authoritative way,
but also the evil spirits obey him \add when\add* he commands\add them\add*!”
\v 28 The people very soon told \add many others\add* throughout the whole Galilee district what Jesus
\add had done\add*. 
\s Mark 1:29-31 
\s Jesus healed Simon's mother-in-law. 
\p
\v 29 After they left ◄the synagogue/the Jewish meeting place►, \add Jesus, Simon and
Andrew\add*, along with James and John went directly to the house of Simon and Andrew.
\v 30 Simon's mother-in-law was lying in bed because she had a \add high\add* fever. Right away someone told Jesus about her
\add being sick\add*. 
\v 31 He went to her, and helped her up by taking hold of her hand. She recovered
\add at once\add* from the fever, and then she\add got up and\add* served them
\add some food\add*. 
\s Mark 1:32-34 
\s Jesus healed many people and expelled many evil spirits from people.
\p
\v 32 That evening, after the sun had gone down \add and restrictions about
travel\add* ◄\add on the Sabbath/on the Jewish rest day\add*► \add were
ended\add*, some people brought to Jesus many people who were sick and others whose lives evil spirits were controlling.
\v 33  \add It seemed as though\add* everyone [HYP, MTY] \add who lived
in\add* the town was gathered at the doorway \add of Simon's house\add*.
\v 34 Jesus healed many people who were ill with various diseases. He also expelled many demons
\add from people\add*. He did not allow the demons to tell people
\add about him\add*, because they knew that he \add had come from God, and for various reasons he did not want everyone to know
that yet\add*. 
\s Mark 1:35-39 
\s Jesus traveled throughout Galilee, preaching and expelling evil spirits from people.
\p
\v 35 Jesus arose very early \add the next morning\add* while it was still dark. He left
\add the house\add* and went away \add from the town\add* to a place where there were no people. Then he prayed there.
\v 36 Simon and his companions searched for him. When they found him,
\add wanting him to go back to town to help other people\add*, they said to him,
\v 37 “\add Come back to the town with us, because\add* many \f + \fr hyperbole \f* people
\add in Capernaum\add* are looking for you!” 
\v 38 He said to them, “\add No\add*, let's go on to the neighboring towns in order that I can preach there also, because the
reason that I came \add into the world\add* was to \add preach to
people\add* in many places!” 
\v 39 So they went throughout Galilee \add district. As they did so, each ◄Sabbath/Jewish rest
day\add*► he preached in ◄synagogues/Jewish meeting places►. He was also expelling evil spirits
\add from people\add*. 
\s Mark 1:40-45 
\s Jesus cured a leper and arranged for him to be able to associate with people again.
\p
\v 40  \add One day\add* a man who had \add a bad skin disease called\add* leprosy came to Jesus. He knelt down in front of
Jesus and then he pleaded with him saying, “\add Please heal me, because I
know\add* you are able to heal me if you want to!” 
\v 41 Jesus felt very sorry for him. \add So he ignored the religious laws about coming close to people who had that
disease\add*. He reached out his hand and touched the man. Then he said to him, “Since I am willing
\add to heal you\add*, be healed {I heal you} \add now\add*!” 
\v 42 Immediately the man was healed! He was no longer a leper! 
\v 43 Jesus spoke sternly to him before he sent him away. 
\v 44 What Jesus said was, “Go to a local priest and show yourself to him
\add in order that he may examine you and verify that you are healed\add*. Then,
\add after the priest tells the local people\add*, they will know
\add that you have been healed, and you will be able to associate with them
again\add*. Make sure that you do not tell others \add about what
happened\add*! Then go to \add Jerusalem and take to the priest what Moses commanded that people who have been healed from
leprosy should offer, in order that he\add* may offer it \add as a sacrifice to
God\add*.” 
\v 45 The man went \add and presented himself to the priest. But
then\add* he began to tell many people about \add how Jesus had healed
him\add* \f + \fr doublet \f*. As a result, Jesus was no longer able to enter any town publicly
\add because the crowds would surround him\add*. Instead, he remained outside
\add the towns\add* in places \add where no people lived\add*. But people kept coming to him from all over that region.
