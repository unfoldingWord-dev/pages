\s MARK 6:1-6a 
\s Jesus taught in the synagogue, and the people who heard him were amazed and offended.
\p
\v 1 Jesus left \add Capernaum city and went to his hometown, Nazareth\add*. His disciples went with him.
\v 2 On the Sabbath\f + \ft Or: On the Jewish rest day \f*, \add he entered\add* the Jewish worship house and taught
\add the people\add*. Many who were listening to him were astonished.
\add But some\add* were saying, “\add This man is just an ordinary person like we are!
So\add* ◄\add we cannot believe that\add* this man \add is able to teach
us\add* about these things and that he has been made very wise {that
\add God\add* has made him very wise} and that he is performing such
miracles!\add \f + \ft Or: how \f* is it that\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* this man \add is able to teach
us\add* about these things and that he has been made very wise {that
\add God\add* has made him very wise} and that he is performing such miracles?► \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 3 ◄\add We know that\add* he is \add just an ordinary\add* carpenter!\f + \ft Or: Isn \f*'t he
\add just an ordinary\add* carpenter \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*?► \add We know him and his family! We
know\add* Mary his mother! ◄\add We know\add* his \add younger\add* brothers James, Joses, Judas and Simon!\f + \ft Or: Are \f* not his
\add younger\add* brothers James, Joses, Judas and Simon?► \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* And his
\add younger\add* sisters also live here with us!\f + \ft Or: do not his \add younger\add* sisters also live here with us? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*” So they
despised him. 
\v 4 Jesus \add knew that they refused to believe in him\add*. So he said to them,
“\add It is certainly true that\add* people honor \add me and other\add* prophets
\add in other places, but\add* not in our hometowns! Even our relatives and the people who live in our own houses do not honor
us!” 
\p
\v 5  \add So\add*, although he healed a few sick people there by touching them, he
\add decided\add* not to perform many \add other\add* miracles \add in
Nazareth\add* because the people there did not believe that he was the Messiah.
\v 6 He was amazed that they did not believe \add in him\add*. 
\s MARK 6:6b-13 
\s Jesus began to send out his disciples two-by-two and gave them power and instructions.
\p Jesus \add and his disciples\add* went from town to town \add in that
region\add* teaching \add the people\add*. 
\v 7  \add One day\add* he summoned the twelve \add disciples\add*, and then he
\add told them that\add* he was going to send them out two-by-two
\add to teach people in various towns\add*. He gave them power \add to
expel\add* evil spirits \add from people\add*. 
\v 8-9 He also instructed them to wear sandals and to take along a walking stick when they were traveling. He told them not to
take food, nor a bag \add in which travelers carry supplies\add*, nor any money for their journey. He also did not allow them
to take extra clothing. \add He wanted the people who heard their message to give them what they
needed\add*. 
\v 10 He also instructed them, “After you enter a town, \add if someone invites you to stay in his
house\add*, go into his house. Eat and sleep in that same home until you leave that town.
\v 11 Wherever the people do not welcome you and wherever the people do not listen to you, shake off the dust from your feet as
you leave \add that place\add*. By doing that, you will warn them
\add that God will punish them for rejecting your message\add*.”
\v 12  \add So\add* after the disciples went out \add to various
towns\add*, they were preaching that people should stop their sinful behavior.
\v 13 They were also expelling many evil spirits\add from people\add*, and they were anointing many sick people with
\add olive\add* oil and healing them. 
\s MARK 6:14-29 
\s King Herod heard about Jesus and wondered if he were John, the Baptizer, come back after King Herod had ordered him to be
executed due to the insistence of his wife, Herodias. 
\p
\v 14  \add King\add* Herod \add Antipas\add* heard about \add what\add* Jesus
\add was doing\add*, because many people were talking \add about
it\add*. \add Some\add* people were saying \add about Jesus\add*,
“\add He must be\add* John the Baptizer! He has risen from the dead! That is why he
\add has God's\add* power to perform these miracles!” 
\v 15 Others were saying \add about Jesus\add*, “He is \add the former
prophet\add* Elijah, \add whom God promised to send back again\add*.” Others were saying
\add about Jesus\add*, “\add No\add*, he is a \add different\add* prophet, like one of the
\add other\add* prophets \add who lived long ago\add*.” 
\v 16 Having heard \add what the people were saying, King\add* Herod
\add Antipas\add* himself repeatedly said, “The man \add performing those
miracles\add* must be John! I \add commanded my soldiers to\add* cut off his head, but he has become alive again
\add to get revenge for my killing him\add*!” 
\v 17 The reason \add King Herod concluded that John wanted revenge is as follows: Some time before
this\add*, Herod married Herodias, while she was \add still\add* the wife of his
\add younger\add* brother, Philip. 
\v 18 John kept telling Herod, “\add God's\add* law does not permit you to marry the wife of your brother
\add while he is still alive\add*.” Then, because Herodias \add urged him to put John in
prison\add*, Herod himself sent \add soldiers to John\add*. They seized John and put him in prison.
\v 19 But because Herodias wanted to get \add further\add* revenge on John, she wanted
\add someone\add* to execute him. But she could not do that because
\add while John was in prison\add*, Herod kept John safe \add from
her\add*. 
\v 20 Herod did this because he respected\f + \ft Or: feared \f* John, because he knew that he was a righteous and holy man. The king did not
know what he should do, but he liked to listen to him. 
\v 21 But \add Herodias was able to have someone execute John when they
honored\f + \ft Or: celebrated \f*\add* the day when Herod was born. On that day, he invited the
\add most important\add* government officials, the \add most important\add* army leaders, and the most important men in Galilee
\add district\add* in order that they might eat \add and celebrate with
him\add*. 
\v 22  \add While they were eating\add*, Herodias' daughter came into the room and, by dancing, she pleased
\add King\add* Herod and his guests. So the king said to her, “Ask me for whatever you desire and I will give it to you!”
\v 23 He also said to her, “Whatever you ask, I will give it to you! I will give you up to half of what I own and rule, if you
ask for it. May God punish me \add if I do not do what I have promised\add*!”
\v 24 The girl immediately left the room and went to her mother. She
\add told her what the king had said, and\add* asked her, “What shall I ask for?” Her mother replied,
“\add Ask the king to give you\add* the head of John the Baptizer!”
\v 25 The girl quickly entered the room again. She went to the king and she requested, “I want you to command someone to
\add cut off\add* the head of John the Baptizer \add and\add* give it to me at once on a platter,
\add so that my mother can know he is dead\add*!” 
\v 26 The king became very distressed \add when he heard what she asked
for\add* because he knew John was a very righteous man \f + \ft Or: because he now knew that he should not have made that promise to
her \f*. But he could not refuse \add what she requested because\add* he had promised
\add that he would give her anything she asked for\add*, and because his guests
\add had heard him promise that\add*. 
\v 27 So the king at once ordered the man who executes prisoners to go and
\add cut off\add* John's head and bring it \add to the girl\add*. That man went to the prison and cut off John's head.
\v 28 He \add put it on\add* a platter, brought it back, and gave it to the girl. The girl took it to her mother.
\v 29 After John's disciples heard \add what happened\add*, they went
\add to the prison\add* and took John's body and then they buried
\add it in a burial cave\add*. 
\s MARK 6:30-34 
\s The apostles returned to Jesus to report what they had done. Then they all went off to a lonely place, but many people
followed them. 
\p
\v 30 The \add twelve\add* apostles returned to Jesus \add from the places to which they had
gone\add*. They reported to him what they had done and what they had taught
\add to people\add*. 
\v 31 He said to them, “Come \add with me\add* to a place where no people are living, in order that we can be alone and rest a
little while!” \add He said this\add* because many people were continually coming to them and going
\add away again\add*, with the result that \add Jesus and\add* his disciples did not have time to eat
\add or do anything else\add*. 
\v 32 So they went away by themselves in a boat to a place where no people were living.
\v 33  \add But many\add* people saw them leaving. They also recognized
\add that they were Jesus and the disciples, and they saw where they were
going\add*. So they ran \add ahead on land\add* from all the \add nearby\add* towns to the place
\add where Jesus and his disciples were going\add*. They \add actually\add* arrived there before
\add Jesus and the disciples\add*. 
\v 34 As Jesus \add and his disciples\add* got out of the boat, Jesus saw this great crowd. He felt sorry for them because they
were \add confused\add*, like sheep that do not have a shepherd. So he taught them many things.
\s MARK 6:35-44 
\s When it became late in the afternoon the people became hungry and there was no place to obtain food; as a result, Jesus
miraculously provided food for them. 
\p
\v 35 Late \add in the afternoon\add* the disciples came to him and said, “This is a place where no people live and it is very
late. 
\v 36  \add So\add* send the people away in order that they may go to the surrounding places
\add where people live\add* and to the villages in order that they can buy for themselves something to eat!”
\v 37 But he replied to them, “\add No\add*, you \add yourselves\add* give them something to eat!” They replied to him, “◄We
could not buy enough bread to feed \add this crowd\add*, even if we had as much money as a man earns by working 200 days!\f + \ft Or: How \f*
could we buy enough bread to feed \add this mob\add*, even if we had as much money as a man earns by working 200 days?►” \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 38 But he replied to them, “How many loaves of bread do you have? Go and find out!” They
\add went and\add* found out and then they told him, “We have \add only\add* five flat loaves and two
\add cooked\add* fish!” 
\v 39 He instructed \add the disciples to tell\add* all the people to sit down on the green grass.
\v 40 So the people sat in groups. There were 50 people in some groups and 100 people in other groups.
\v 41 Jesus took the five flat loaves and the two fish. He looked up towards heaven and thanked
\add God\add* for them. Then he broke the loaves and fish into pieces and kept giving them to the disciples in order that they
would distribute them to the people. 
\v 42 Everyone ate \add this food\add* until they all had enough to eat!
\v 43 The disciples then collected twelve baskets full of pieces
\add of bread\add* and of the fish \add that were left over\add*.
\v 44 There were approximately five thousand men who ate the bread\add and fish. They did not even count the women and
children\add*. 
\s MARK 6:45-52 
\s Jesus sent his disciples ahead of him to Bethsaida by boat while he stayed to pray. Later he saw that they were in
difficulty due to a wind blowing against them so he went to them, walking on the water.
\p
\v 45 Right away Jesus told his disciples to get into the boat and then go ahead of him to Bethsaida
\add town, which was\add* further around\add Lake Galilee. He stayed
and\add* dismissed the many people who were there. 
\v 46 After he said goodbye to the people, he went up into the hills in order to pray.
\v 47 When it was evening, the \add disciples'\add* boat was in the middle of the lake and Jesus was by himself on the land.
\v 48 He saw that the wind was \add blowing\add* against them as they rowed. As a result, they were having great difficulty. He
approached them early in the morning, when it was still dark, by walking on the water. He intended to walk by them.
\v 49 They saw him walking on the water, but they thought that he was a ghost. They screamed
\v 50 because they all were terrified when they saw him. But he talked to them. He said to them, “Be calm! Do not be afraid,
\add because\add* it is I!” 
\v 51 He got into the boat \add and sat down\add* with them and the wind stopped blowing. They were completely amazed
\add about what he had done\add*. 
\v 52  \add Although they had seen Jesus multiply\add* the \add bread and the
fish\add*, they did not understand \add from that how powerful he was, as they should
have\add*. They did not think clearly about it. 
\s MARK 6:53-56 
\s As soon as Jesus and his disciples reached land and disembarked, people began to come to Jesus, bringing sick people in
order that he might heal them, and he healed all who touched him.
\p
\v 53 After they went further around \add Lake Galilee in a boat, they came to the shore at Gennesaret
town\add*. Then they fastened the boat there. 
\v 54 As soon as they got out of the boat, \add the people there\add* recognized Jesus.
\v 55 So they ran throughout the whole district \add in order to tell others that Jesus was
there\add*. Then the people \add placed\add* those who were sick on stretchers and carried them to any place where they heard
\add people say\add* that Jesus was. 
\v 56 In whatever village, town or other place where he entered, they would bring to the marketplaces those who were sick. Then
the \add sick people\add* would beg Jesus to let them touch \add him
or\add* even the edge of his clothes \add in order that Jesus might heal
them\add*. All those who touched \add him or his robe\add* were healed.
