\s Mark 2:1-12 
\s By healing a paralyzed man Jesus demonstrated his authority to forgive sins as well as to heal.
\p
\v 1  \add Jesus and his disciples\add* returned to Capernaum \add town\add*. A few days later, because it was {people} heard
that Jesus was in \add his\add* house, 
\v 2 many people gathered there. As a result, \add after the people filled the
house\add*, there was no longer space to stand \add in the house
or\add* around the doorway \add outside\add*. Jesus preached \add God's\add* message to them.
\v 3 Some people came to the house bringing to Jesus a man who was paralyzed. He was carried by four men {Four men carried
\add him\add*} \add on a sleeping pad\add*. 
\v 4 They were not able to bring the man to Jesus because there was a crowd there. So they
\add went up the steps to the flat roof and\add* removed \add some
of\add* the tiles \add above\add* where Jesus was. Then, after they made a
\add big\add* hole in the roof, they lowered \add by ropes\add* the sleeping pad on which the paralyzed man lay. They lowered
\add it through the hole, down in front of Jesus\add*. 
\v 5 After Jesus perceived that the men believed \add that he could heal this
man\add*, he said to the paralyzed man, “My friend, \add I\add* forgive your sins!”
\v 6 There were some men who taught \add the Jewish\add* laws sitting there. They started deliberating within themselves like
this: 
\v 7 “Who does this man think he is, talking like that \f + \fk rhetorical question \f*? ◄He is insulting God!/Does he think he is God?► \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* ◄No person
can forgive sins!/Who can forgive sins?► \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* Only God can forgive sins!”
\v 8 Jesus knew right away within himself that they were deliberating like that within themselves. So he said to them, “◄You
should not question within yourselves \add whether I have the right to forgive this man's
sins\add*!/Why do you question \add whether I have the right to forgive this man's
sins\add*?► \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* 
\v 9 It is \add not risky\add* \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* for someone to tell the man who is paralyzed, ‘Your sins are forgiven
{\add I\add* forgive your sins},’ \add because no one can prove that it has
happened\add*. But no one would say to him, ‘Get up, pick up your stretcher, and then walk away’,
\add unless he really had the power to heal him, because people can easily see whether it happens or
not\add*. 
\v 10 So I \add will do something\add* in order that you may know that
\add God\add* has authorized me, the one who came from heaven, to forgive sins on earth
\add as well as to heal people\add*.” Then he said to the paralyzed man,
\v 11 “To you I say, ‘Get up! Pick up your sleeping pad! And then go home!’”
\v 12  \f +  \fr 2.12 \ft COL 5.1 - prj:T4T1.COL5.1\f* The man stood up immediately! He picked up the sleeping pad, and then he
went away, while all the people \add there\add* were watching. They were all amazed, and they praised God and said, “We have
never before seen anything like \add what happened\add* just now!”
\s Mark 2:13-17 
\s Jesus invited Levi to be his disciple and refuted those who objected to his associating with such people.
\p
\v 13 Jesus left \add Capernaum town again and walked with his disciples\add* alongside
\add Galilee\add* lake. A large crowd came to him. Then he taught them.
\v 14 As he walked on further, he saw a man named Levi, whose other name was Matthew, and whose father's name was Alpheus. He
was sitting in his office where he collected taxes \add for the Roman
government\add*. Jesus said to him, “Come with me \add and become my
disciple\add*!” So he got up and went with Jesus. 
\p
\v 15  \add Later\add*, Jesus was eating a meal in Levi's house. Many men who collected taxes and
\add other\add* people who were \add considered to be\add* sinning regularly were eating with Jesus and his disciples.
\add This was not surprising\add*, for there were many people like this who were going
\add everywhere\add* with Jesus. 
\v 16 The \add men who taught the Jewish\add* laws \add who were
there\add* and who were members of the Pharisee \add sect\add* saw that Jesus was eating with men who collected taxes and
\add others who were considered\add* {\add whom they considered\add*}
\add to be\add* sinners. So they said to his disciples, “◄It is disgusting that he eats with
\add such disgusting\add* men as those who collect taxes, and with
\add other\add* sinners!/Why is it that he eats with \add such disgusting\add* men as those who collect taxes, and with
\add other\add* sinners?►” \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* 
\v 17 After Jesus heard \add what they were saying\add*, he said to the men who taught the
\add Jewish\add* laws, “People who \add consider that they\add* are well do not seek a doctor. On the contrary, it is those who
are sick \add who seek a doctor\add* \f + \fk metaphor \f*!” \add This he said to indicate that it was those who knew that they had sinned who
were coming to him in order that he might help them spiritually\add*. And he said, “I did not come to invite people
\add who think that\add* \f + \fk irony \f* they are righteous \add to come to me and turn from their sinful
behavior\add*. On the contrary, I came \add from heaven to invite\add* people who
\add know that they\add* are sinners, \add in order that they might turn from their sins and come to
me\add*.” 
\s Mark 2:18-22 
\s Jesus told them it was inappropriate for his disciples to show sorrow by fasting while he was with them, and that requiring
people to perform rituals like fasting was inconsistent with the new way of life he was bringing.
\p
\v 18 The disciples of John \add the Baptizer\add* and some men who belonged to the Pharisee
\add sect\add* used to abstain from food \add to show that they wanted to please
God\add*. One day, some people came \add to Jesus\add* and asked him
\add critically\add*, “The disciples of John and the Pharisees ◄fast/abstain from food►
\add from time to time\add*, but your disciples do not. \add We think they should abstain from food also. What do you say about
that\add* \f + \fk rhetorical question \f*?” 
\v 19  \add Jesus wanted them to understand that it was not appropriate for his disciples to show sorrow by abstaining from
food while he was still with them\add*. So he said to them, “When a man is marrying a woman, his friends will certainly not
abstain from food while he is still with them, will they \f + \fk rhetorical question \f*? No. During the time that he is with them, they will not abstain
from food \add because they are happy together\add*. 
\v 20 But some day, he will be taken away {his \add enemies\add* will take him away} from them. Then, in those days, they will
abstain from food, \add because they will be sad\add*.” 
\p
\v 21  \add Jesus wanted to show that those who desire to live in accordance with his new message should not try to continue to
obey the old religious traditions like fasting. So he also said to
them\add*, “People do not sew a patch of unshrunken cloth on an old garment
\add in order to mend a hole\add*. If they did that, \add when they washed the garment, the patch would
shrink\add* and the new \add piece of cloth\add* would tear off more of the old cloth. As a result, the hole would become
bigger! 
\v 22  \add Similarly\add*, people do not put newly \add squeezed\add* grape juice into old skin bags
\add to store it\add*. If they did that, that juice will burst the skin bags
\add because they would not stretch when the wine ferments and expands\add*. As a result both the wine and the skin bags would
be ruined! On the contrary, people must put new wine into new skin bags!” \f + \fk metaphor \f*
\s MARK 2:23-28 
\s When the Pharisees complained about Jesus' disciples plucking grain on the Sabbath day, Jesus replied that there was
Scriptural precedent for ignoring religious laws if there was a physical need, and that he is the one to decide what people
should do on the Sabbath. 
\p
\v 23 On one ◄Sabbath/Jewish day of rest► Jesus was walking through some grain fields with his disciples. As they were walking
along \add through the grain fields\add*, the disciples were plucking some of the heads of grain.
\add They rubbed them in their hands to remove the chaff, and were eating the grain. The laws of Moses permitted people to do
that if they were hungry\add*. 
\v 24  \add Some of\add* the Pharisees \add saw them doing what they considered to be work. So
they\add* said to him, “Look! ◄They should not be doing on our ◄Sabbath day/day of rest►
\add work\add* that our laws forbid!/Why are they doing on our ◄Sabbath day/day of rest►
\add work\add* that our laws forbid?► \f + \fk rhetorical question \f*” 
\v 25  \add Jesus wanted to show them that the record in the Scriptures indicated that God permitted people to disobey certain
religious laws when they needed food\add*. So he said to them, “\add It is written in the
Scriptures\add* what \add our revered ancestor, King\add* David, did when he needed food, and both he and the men with him were
hungry. You have read about that, but ◄\add you do not think about what it implies./why do you not think about what it
implies\add*?► \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* 
\v 26 During the time Abiathar was high priest, David entered the big tent
\add where people worshipped\add* God \add and asked for some bread. The high priest gave him
some\add* of the loaves of bread. That bread was the bread he had presented to God. It was permitted in one of Moses' laws that
only the priests could eat that bread! But David ate some of it. Then he also gave some of it to the men who were with him.
\add But God did not consider that was wrong!\add*” 
\v 27 Jesus said to them further, “\add God\add* established ◄the day of rest/the Sabbath day►
\add to help\add* people! He did not create people to \add obey rules
about\add* ◄the Sabbath/the day of rest►! 
\v 28 And \add think about this\add*: I am the one who came from heaven. So I have the authority
\add to determine what is right for my disciples to do\add* ◄on the Sabbath/on the Jewish rest day►!”
