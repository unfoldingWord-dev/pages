\c 25  
\s The seventh year 
\p
\v 1 Yahweh said to Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f* on Sinai Mountain, 
\v 2 “Tell the Israelis \add that I, Yahweh, say this\add*: ‘When you enter the land that I am about to give you, every seventh
year you must \add honor\add* me by \add not planting any seeds. It will be as though you
are\add* allowing the ground to rest. 
\v 3 For six years you are plant seeds in your fields and prune your grapevines and harvest the crops.
\v 4 But the seventh\f + \ft Or: next \f* year you must \add dedicate\add* to me, and allow your fields to rest. Do not plant seeds in your
fields or prune your grapevines \add during that year\add*. 
\v 5 Do not reap \add the grain\add* that grows in your fields without having been planted, or harvest the grapes that grow;
you must allow the land to rest for that one year. 
\v 6 But you are permitted to eat whatever crops grow by themselves during that year without having been planted. You and your
male and female servants, and workers whom you have hired, and people who are living among you for temporarily, are permitted
to eat it. 
\v 7 Also, \add during that year\add* your livestock and the wild animals in you land are permitted to eat it.’ ”
\s The fiftieth year 
\p
\v 8-9 “Also, after every forty-nine years has ended, you must do this: ◄on the tenth day of the seventh month\f + \ft Or: at \f* the end of
September►\add of the next\f + \ft Or: 50th \f* year\add*, blow trumpets throughout the country, to declare that it will be a day on which you
request that I will forgive you for the sins that you have committed.
\v 10 Set apart that year, and proclaim that throughout the country, it will be a year of freeing land and people: all the
people \add who sold their property\add* will receive back the property that they previously owned, and slaves must be
freed\f + \ft Or: allowed to return to \add their property and\add* their families \f*.
\v 11 That year will be a Year of Celebration; \add during that year\add* do not plant anything, and do not harvest the
grain\f + \ft Or: wheat \f* that grows without having been planted, or the grapes that grow without the vines being pruned.
\v 12 It will be a Year of Sacred Celebration, so eat \add only\add* what grows in the fields ◄by itself\f + \ft Or: without \f* any work being
done to produce anything►. 
\p
\v 13 In that Year of Celebration, everyone must return to their own property.
\p
\v 14 If you sell some of your land to a fellow Israeli or if you buy some land from one of them, you must treat that person
fairly: 
\v 15 if you buy land, the price that you will pay will depend on the number of years there will be until the next Year of
Celebration. If someone sells land to you, he will charge a price that is determined by the number of years until the next Year
of Celebration. 
\v 16 If there will be many years before the next Year of Celebration, the price will be higher; if there will be only a few
years until the next Year of Celebration, the price will be lower.
\add You could say that\add* what he is really selling you is the number of
\add years in which you can plant\add* crops \add before the next Year of
Celebration\add*. 
\v 17 Do not cheat each other; instead, revere me; I, Yahweh your God,
\add am the one who am commanding this\add*. 
\p
\v 18 Obey all my laws \f + \ft doublet \f* carefully. If you do that, you will continue to live safely in your country \f + \ft doublet \f*.
\v 19 And crops will grow well on the land, and you will have plenty to eat.
\v 20 But you may ask, ‘If we do not plant or harvest our crops during the seventh year, what will we have to eat?’
\v 21  \add My answer is that\add* I will bless you very much during the sixth\f + \ft Or: previous \f* year, with the result that during that
year there will be enough crops to provide food for you for three years!
\v 22 Then, after you plant seed during the eighth\f + \ft Or: next \f* year \add and wait for the crops to
grow\add*, you will eat the food grown in the sixth\f + \ft Or: previous \f* year, and continue to eat it until more food is harvested in the
ninth year! 
\p
\v 23 You must not sell any of your land to belong to someone else permanently, because the land is
\add not yours\add*; it is really mine, and you are only living on it temporarily and farming\f + \ft Or: taking care of \f* it for me.
\v 24 Throughout the country that you will possess, you must remember that if someone sells some of his land to you, he is
permitted to buy it back from you \add if he wants to\add*. 
\p
\v 25 So, if one of your fellow Israelis becomes poor and sells some of his property
\add to obtain some money\add*, the person who is most closely related to him is permitted to come and buy that land.
\v 26 However, if a man has no one to buy the land for him, and he himself prospers again and saves enough money to buy that
land back, 
\v 27 he must calculate how many years there will be until the next Year of Celebration. Then he must pay to the man who bought
the land the money that he would have earned by continuing to grow crops on that land for those years.
\v 28 But if the original owner does not have any money to buy the land that he sold, it will continue to belong to the man who
bought it, until the next Year of Celebration. In that year it must be returned to its original owner, and he will be able to
live on it again. 
\p
\v 29 If someone who lives in a city that has a wall around it sells a house there, during the next year he will be permitted
to buy it from the man who bought it. 
\v 30 If he does not buy it during that year, it will belong permanently to the man who bought it, and to his descendants. It
must not be returned to the original owner in the Year of Celebration.
\v 31 But houses that are in villages that do not have walls around them are considered to be as though they are in a field. So
if someone sells one of those houses, he is permitted to buy it back at any time. And
\add if he does not buy it\add*, it must be returned to him in the Year of Celebration.
\p
\v 32 If any descendants of Levi sell their houses in the towns in which they live, they are permitted to buy them back at any
time. 
\v 33 And because the houses in their towns are on land that \add was given to them
by\add* other Israelis, that land will become theirs again in the Year of Celebration
\add if they do not buy it back before then\add*. 
\v 34 But the pastureland near their towns must not be sold. It must belong to the original owners permanently\f + \ft Or: forever \f*.
\p
\v 35 If one of your fellow Israelis becomes poor and is unable to buy what he needs [IDI], others of you must help him like
you would help a foreigner who is living among you \f + \ft doublet \f* temporarily.
\v 36  \add If you lend money to him\add*, do not charge any kind of interest \f + \ft doublet \f*. Instead,
\add show by what you do that\add* you revere me, your God, and help that man, in order that he will be able to continue to
live among you. 
\v 37 If you lend him money, do not charge interest; and if you sell food to him,
\add charge him only what you paid for it\add*; do not get a profit from it.
\v 38  \add Do not forget that\add* I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out of Egypt to be your God and to give you the land
of Canaan, \add and I did not charge you for doing that\add*. 
\p
\v 39 If one of your fellow Israelis becomes poor and sells himself to you, do not force him to work like a slave.
\v 40 Treat him like you treat workers that you hire or like someone who is living on your land temporarily. But he must work
for you \add only\add* until the Year of Celebration. 
\v 41 During that year, you must free him, and he will go back to his family and to the property that his ancestors owned.
\v 42  \add It is as though\add* you Israelis are my slaves\f + \ft Or: servants \f*, whom I
\add freed from being slaves\add* in Egypt. So none of you should be sold to become slaves.
\v 43 And do not treat the Israelis whom you buy cruelly; instead, revere me, your God.
\p
\v 44 If you want to have slaves, you are permitted to buy them from nearby countries.
\v 45 You are also permitted to buy some of the foreigners who are living among you, and members of their clans that were born
in your country. Then you will own them. 
\v 46 They will be your slaves for the remaining years of your life, and after you die, it is permitted for your children to
own them. But you must not act in brutal ways toward your fellow Israelis.
\p
\v 47 If a foreigner who is living among you \f + \ft doublet \f* becomes rich, and if one of your fellow Israelis becomes poor and sells
himself to that foreigner or to a member of his clan\f + \ft Or: family \f*, 
\v 48 it is permitted for someone to pay for him to be freed. It is permitted for one of his relatives to pay for him to be
released: 
\v 49 an uncle or a cousin or another relative in his clan may pay for him to be released. Or, if he prospers
\add and gets enough money\add*, he is permitted to pay for his own release.
\v 50 The man who wants to pay for his own release must count the number of years until the next Year of Celebration. The price
he pays to the man who bought him will depend on the pay that would be given to a hired worker for that number of years.
\v 51 If there are a lot of years that remain until the Year of Celebration, he must pay for his release a larger amount of the
money. 
\v 52 If there are only a few years that remain until the Year of Celebration, he must pay a smaller amount to be released.
\v 53 During those years that he is working for the man who bought him, the man who bought him must treat him like he would
treat a hired worker, and all of you must make sure that his owner does not treat him cruelly.
\p
\v 54 And even if a fellow Israeli who has sold himself to a rich man is not able to pay for himself to be freed by any of
these ways, he and his children must be freed in the Year of Celebration,
\v 55 because \add it is as though\add* you Israelis are my slaves\f + \ft Or: servants \f*, whom I, Yahweh your God, freed from
\add being slaves\add* in Egypt.”
