\c 6  
\p
\v 1 Yahweh also said to Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f*, 
\v 2 "If you sin against Yahweh by deceiving someone — if you refuse to return what someone has lent you, of if you steal
something of his, of if you find something and claim that you do not have it,
\v 3 you are guilty. You must return to its owner what you have stolen or what someone has lent you and you have not returned,
or what you found that someone else had lost, 
\v 4 or whatever you lied about. 
\v 5 You must not only return anything like that to its owner, but you must also pay to the owner one-fifth to its value.
\v 6 You must also bring to the priest a ram to be an offering to Yahweh in order that you will no longer be guilty. The ram
that you bring must be one that has no defects, one that is worth the right amount.
\v 7 Then the priest will offer that ram to be a sacrifice that will cause you to no longer be guilty, and you will be forgiven
for the wrong things that you did." 
\s The burnt offerings 
\p
\v 8 Yahweh also said to Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f*, 
\v 9 "Tell this to Aaron and his sons: 'These are the regulations concerning the offerings that will be completely burned
\add on the altar\add*: The offering must remain on the altar all during the night, and the fire on the altar must always be
kept burning. 
\v 10  \add The next morning\add* the priest must put on his linen under-clothes and linen outer clothes. Then he must remove
the ashes of the offering from the fire and put them beside the altar.
\v 11 Then he must take off those clothes and put on other clothes, and take the ashes outside the camp, to a place that is
acceptable to Yahweh. 
\v 12 The fire on the altar must always be kept burning; the priest must not allow it to go out\f + \ft Or: quit burning \f*. Each morning
the priest must put more firewood on the fire. Then he must arrange more offerings on the fire, and burn on the altar the fat
of the offerings to be burned to maintain fellowship \add with Yahweh\add*.
\v 13 The fire on the altar must be kept burning continually; the priest must not allow it to go out.' "
\s The grain offerings 
\p
\v 14 These are the regulations concerning the offerings made from grain: Aaron's sons must bring them to Yahweh in front of
the altar. 
\v 15 The priest must take a handful of fine flour mixed with olive oil and incense and burn that on the altar. That handful
will signify that the whole offering truly belongs to Yahweh. And the aroma while it burns will be pleasing to Yahweh.
\v 16 Aaron and his sons may eat the remaining part of the grain offering. But they must eat it in a holy place, in the
courtyard of the temple. 
\v 17 It must not have yeast mixed with it. Like the offerings for sin and the offerings to cause people to no longer be guilty
of sin, that offering is very holy. 
\v 18 Any male descendants of Aaron are permitted to eat it, because it is forever their regular share of the offerings given
to Yahweh and burned in the fire \add on the altar\add*. Anyone else who touches those offerings made from grain will be
punished by God. 
\p
\v 19 Yahweh also said to Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f*, 
\v 20 "Tell Aaron and his sons that this is the offering that they must bring to Yahweh on the day that any of them is
ordained\f + \ft Or: becomes a priest \f*: That person must bring two quarts, Or: liters of fine flour as an offering made from grain. He must
bring half of it in the morning and half of it in the evening. 
\v 21 He must mix it well with olive oil and bake it in a shallow pan. He must then break it into small pieces to be burned
\add on the altar\add*. And the aroma while it burns will be pleasing to Yahweh.
\v 22 I have commanded that the descendants of Aaron who are appointed to become the Supreme Priests after Aaron dies are the
ones who must prepare those things. They must be completely burned
\add on the altar\add* to be sacrifices to Yahweh. 
\v 23 Every offering that a priest gives that is made from grain must be completely burned; none of it is to be eaten."
\s The sin offering 
\p
\v 24 Yahweh also said to Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f*, 
\v 25 "Tell Aaron and his sons, 'These are the regulations concerning the offerings to cause people to become acceptable to God
again: 
\v 26 The animals must be slaughtered in Yahweh's presence in the same place that the animals that are to be completely burned
\add on the altar\add* are slaughtered, in the courtyard in front of the Sacred Tent.
\v 27 Any other person who touches any of its meat will be punished by God. And if its blood is splattered on your clothes, you
must wash the clothes in a holy place. 
\v 28 If the meat is cooked in a clay pot, the pot must be broken
\add afterwards\add*. But if it is cooked in a bronze pot, the pot must be scoured
\add afterwards\add* and rinsed with water. 
\v 29 Any male in a priest's family may eat some of the cooked meat; that meat is very holy.
\v 30 But if the blood of those offerings is brought into the Sacred Tent to enable the people to be forgiven for having
sinned, the meat of those animals must not be eaten. The meat must be completely burned.' "
