\c 9  
\s Aaron and his sons started to offer sacrifices 
\p
\v 1 Eight days later, Moses/I summoned the elders of Israel. 
\v 2 Then he/I said to Aaron, “Take a young bull for the offering to enable you leaders to become acceptable to Yahweh again,
and a ram to be completely burned \add on the altar\add*, both of them without any defects, and offer them to Yahweh.
\v 3 Then say to the Israeli people, ‘Take one male goat for the offering to enable you all to become acceptable to Yahweh.
Also take a calf and a lamb that have no defects, to be an offering completely burned
\add on the altar\add*. 
\v 4 Also take an ox and a ram to be an offering to maintain fellowship
\add with Yahweh\add*, along with an offering of flour mixed with olive oil. Do this because today Yahweh is going to appear to
you.’ ” 
\p
\v 5  \add After Aaron/I told this to the Israeli people, some of
them\add* took the things that Moses/I had commanded them to take, and went to the courtyard in front of the Sacred Tent. Then
all the people came near and stood in front of Yahweh. 
\v 6 Then Moses/I said, “This is what Yahweh has commanded you to do, in order that his glory will appear to you.”
\p
\v 7 Then Moses/I said to Aaron, “Come to the altar and sacrifice the animal that is your offering to enable you to become
acceptable to God, and the animal that will be completely burned there. Those offerings will enable God to forgive you and the
people for the sins that you have committed \f + \fk doublet \f*. Do those things that Yahweh has commanded.”
\p
\v 8 So Aaron came close to the altar and slaughtered the calf to be an offering for his sins.
\v 9 His sons brought its blood to him \add in a bowl\add*. He dipped his finger into the blood and put some of it on the
projections at the corners of the altar. He poured out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar.
\v 10 He/I burned the fat, including that which covered the kidneys and the liver, as Yahweh had commanded him/me.
\v 11 Then Aaron burned \add the rest of\add* the meat and the hide/skin outside the camp.
\p
\v 12 Then Aaron slaughtered the animal that would be completely burned
\add on the altar\add*. His sons handed him the \add bowl containing\add* its blood, and he sprinkled the blood on all sides of
the altar. 
\v 13 Then they handed him the head and the pieces of the animal that would be burned, and he burned them on the altar.
\v 14 He washed the inner parts and the legs of the animal, and burned them on the altar, on top of the other pieces of the
animal. 
\p
\v 15 Then Aaron brought the animals that would be sacrifices for the Israeli people. He took the goat and slaughtered it to be
an offering to enable them to become acceptable to God, like he had done with the goat for his own offering
\p
\v 16 Then he brought the animal for the offering to be completely burned. He slaughtered it and offered it in the way that
Yahweh had commanded him to do. 
\v 17 He also brought the offering made from grain. He took a handful of it and burned it on the altar, like he had done for
the animal that he had slaughtered and completely burned \add on the
altar\add* in the morning. 
\p
\v 18 Then he slaughtered the ox and the ram, to be an offering for the Israeli people to maintain fellowship with Yahweh. His
sons handed him \add the bowl containing\add* the blood, and he sprinkled the blood against all sides of the altar.
\v 19 But he took the fat from the ox and the ram, including their fat tails that were cut close to the backbone, and all the
fat that covered the livers and the kidneys. 
\v 20 He put them on top of the breasts of the animals and carried them to the altar to be burned.
\v 21 Then, doing what Moses/I had commanded, he lifted up in front of Yahweh the breast of the other animal and the right
thigh, to signify that the whole animal truly belonged to Yahweh.
\p
\v 22 Then Aaron lifted his arms toward the people and \add asked Yahweh
to\add* bless them. Then having finished making all those offerings, he stepped down
\add from the place where the altar was\add*. 
\p
\v 23 Then Aaron and Moses/I entered the Sacred Tent. When they/we later came out, they/we
\add asked Yahweh to\add* bless the people. And suddenly the glory/brightness of Yahweh appeared to all the people.
\v 24 A fire from Yahweh appeared and burned up the offering that was being completely burned and the fat that was on the
altar. And when all the people saw that, they shouted joyfully and prostrated themselves on the ground
\add to worship Yahweh\add*.
