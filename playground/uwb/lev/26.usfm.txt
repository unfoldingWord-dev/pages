\c 26  
\s Promised blessings for obeying Yahweh 
\p
\v 1  \add Yahweh also said this to Moses/me on Sinai Mountain\add*: “Do not make idols or set up statues of false gods or
sacred stones \add to worship other gods\add*. And do not put on your property a stone that has been shaped
\add to resemble a false god\add* and bow down to \add worship\add* it.
\add You must worship only\add* me, Yahweh, your God. 
\p
\v 2 Honor the Sabbath days and revere my Sacred Temple, because I, Yahweh,
\add live there\add*. 
\p
\v 3 If you carefully obey all my commands \f + \fk doublet \f*, 
\v 4 I will send rain for you at the proper/right times, in order that crops will grow on your land and there will be plenty of
fruit on your trees. 
\v 5 You will continue \add harvesting and\add* threshing \add grain\add* until it is time to harvest grapes, and you will
continue to harvest grapes until it is time to start planting \add things in the following
year\add*. And you will have all the food that you want to eat, and you will live safely in your land.
\p
\v 6  \add If you obey all my laws\add*, there will be peace in your country, and when you lie down
\add to sleep\add*, nothing will cause you to be afraid. I will get rid of the dangerous animals in your country, and there
will no wars \f + \fk metonymy \f* in your country. 
\v 7 You will pursue your enemies and kill them with your swords:
\v 8 five of you will pursue a hundred of them, and a hundred of you will pursue a thousand of them and kill them with your
swords. 
\p
\v 9  \add If you obey all my laws\add*, I will bless you and cause you to have many children \f + \fk doublet \f*. And I will do what I said
that I would do in the agreement that I made with you. 
\v 10 When you are still eating food from the harvest from the previous year, it will be necessary for you to throw away some
of it to make space for the new harvest. 
\v 11 I will live among you in my Sacred Tent, and I will never reject you.
\v 12 I will walk among you and continue to be your God, and you will continue to be my people.
\v 13 I am Yahweh your God, the one who brought you out of Egypt in order that you would no longer be slaves of the people of
Egypt. \add When you were there, it was as though you were animals that worked for the people of Egypt, but it was as
though\add* \f + \fk metaphor \f* I broke the bars of the ◄yokes/frames that were put around your necks► and enabled you to walk with your
heads up.” 
\s Promised punishments for disobeying Yahweh 
\p
\v 14 “But if you will not heed me and obey all these commands, 
\v 15 and if you reject \f + \fk doublet \f* my decrees and laws, and do not do \f + \fk doublet \f* what I commanded you to do in the agreement that I made
with you, 
\v 16 these are the things that I will do to you: I will suddenly send disasters that will ruin you. You will have diseases
that cannot be cured, and fevers that will cause you to become blind and will slowly kill you. It will be useless for you to
plant seeds, because your enemies will eat the crops that grow. 
\v 17 I will reject/abandon you [IDI], with the result that you will be defeated by your enemies. Then those who hate you will
rule you, and you will run away even when no one is pursuing you.
\p
\v 18 If you still will not heed me after all those things happen to you, I will continue to punish you again and again for the
sins that you have committed. 
\v 19 I will cause you to no longer be stubborn and proud; I will cause
\add no rain to fall; it will be as though\add* \f + \fk metaphor \f* the sky is made of iron, and the ground will be
\add as hard as\add* brass \f + \fk metaphor \f*. 
\v 20 You will uselessly work very hard \add to plant seeds\add*, because crops will not grow in the hard soil in your fields,
and fruit will not grow on your trees. 
\p
\v 21 If you continue to oppose me and refuse to heed me, I will cause you to experience disasters again and again, like you
deserve to experience because of your sins. 
\v 22 I will send wild animals to attack you, and they will kill your little children and destroy your cattle. There will be
very few of you who will remain alive, with the result that there will be very few \f + \fk hyperbole \f* people walking on the roads in your
country. 
\p
\v 23 When you experience those things that I do to punish you, if you still do not pay attention to me, and if you continue to
oppose me, 
\v 24 I myself will oppose you, and I will punish you for your sins again and again.
\v 25 I will send wars \f + \fk metonymy \f* to you to punish you for not doing the things that I commanded you to do in the agreement that I
made with you. If you \add try to escape from your enemies by\add* shutting yourselves in your cities
\add that have walls around them\add*, I will send plagues to you, and I will allow your enemies to capture [IDI] you.
\v 26 When I cut off your food supply, there will be very little flour with which to make bread. As a result, ten woman will be
able to bake all their bread in \add only\add* one oven. \add When the bread is
baked\add*, each woman will divide it \add among the members of her family, but there will be very little for each
one\add*, and when they have eaten all of it, they will still be hungry.
\p
\v 27 After all those things happen, if you still do not heed me, if you still oppose me,
\v 28 I will be very angry with you, and I will oppose you, and I myself will punish you for your sins again and again.
\v 29  \add You will be extremely hungry, with the result that\add* you will
\add kill\add* your sons and daughters and eat their flesh. 
\v 30 I will cause the shrines \add where you worship idols\add* on hilltops to be destroyed. I will smash the altars where you
burn incense \add to worship your gods\add*, and I will cause your corpses to be piled on the lifeless statues of your gods.
And I will detest you. 
\v 31 I will cause your cities to become heaps of ruins, and I will cause the buildings that are dedicated to the worship of
your gods to be smashed. And I will not be pleased at all with the aroma of your offerings
\add that are burned on the altar\add*. 
\v 32 I will completely ruin your country, with the result that even your enemies who capture it will be shocked/appalled
\add when they see it\add*. 
\v 33 I will enable \add your enemies to kill you with\add* their swords, and I will cause the rest of you to be scattered
among other nations. Your country will be ruined and your cities will become ruins.
\v 34 After that happens, as long as you are living in your enemies' countries, your land will be allowed to rest, like you
should have allowed it to rest every seven years. 
\v 35 All the time that your land is desolate, it will be able to rest, like you did not enable it to rest during all the years
that you lived there. 
\p
\v 36 As for you people who will remain alive in the countries to which your enemies
\add will have taken you\add*, I will cause you to become extremely afraid, with the result that when you hear the sounds of
leaves being blown by the wind, you will run away. You will run like \f + \fk simile \f* you are running from
\add a man carrying\add* a sword, and you will fall down, even though no one is pursuing you.
\v 37 You will stumble over each other. So you will not be able to stand and fight your enemies.
\v 38 Many of you will die in the countries that belong to your enemies \f + \fk doublet \f*.
\v 39 And those of you who remain alive will slowly die and rot in the countries of your enemies because of your sins and
because of the sins of your ancestors. 
\p
\v 40-41 But your descendants must confess their sins and the sins that their ancestors committed. Your ancestors acted
unfaithfully toward me and were hostile to me, with the result that I forced them to go to the countries that belonged to their
enemies. But when your descendants humble themselves \f + \fk synecdoche \f* and stop being very stubborn [IDI] and accept being punished for
their sins, 
\v 42 I will keep in mind the agreement that I made with \add your
ancestors\add* Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, and \add what I promised to them about
Canaan\add* land. 
\v 43 But \add before that happens\add*, my people will be forced to leave that country, with the result that the land will be
able to rest while it is desolate and while the people are being punished for rejecting my laws and hating my decrees \f + \fk doublet \f*.
\v 44 But when that happens, I will still not reject them or hate them and destroy them completely. I will not cancel the
agreement that I made with them; I will still be Yahweh their God.
\v 45 I will ◄keep in mind/never forget► the agreement that I made with your ancestors when I brought them out of Egypt, in
order that the people of all nations will know that I, Yahweh, \add will continue
to\add* be your God.” 
\p
\v 46 Those are the decrees, the laws, and the regulations \f + \fk doublet \f* that Yahweh established on Sinai Mountain between himself and
the Israeli people by \add giving them to\add* Moses/me \add to tell to
them\add*.
