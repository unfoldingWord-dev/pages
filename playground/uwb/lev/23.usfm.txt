\c 23  
\s Religious celebrations 
\p
\v 1 Yahweh said to Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f*, 
\v 2 "Tell the Israeli people about the festivals that I have appointed, the days when you all must gather together
\add to worship me\add*. 
\s The Sabbath 
\p
\v 3 You may work for six days \add each week\add*, but on the seventh day you must not do any work. You must rest. It is a
sacred\f + \ft Or: holy \f* day when you must gather together \add to worship me\add*. Wherever you live, you must rest on that day.
\s The festival of Passover and unleavened bread 
\p
\v 4 There are other festivals that I have established\f + \ft Or: appointed \f* for you. Those will also be sacred\f + \ft Or: holy \f* days when you must
gather together \add to worship me\add*. 
\v 5  \add The first festival is\add* the Passover\f + \ft Or: when you remember that I spared your ancestors when I killed all the
firstborn Egyptian sons \f*. That festival will begin at twilight\f + \ft Or: dusk \f*\f + \ft Or: sunset \f* on the appointed day each Spring\f + \ft Or: in March or April
each year \f*. 
\v 6 The next day, the festival of eating bread that has no yeast will begin. That festival will continue for seven days.
During that time, the bread that you eat must be made without yeast.
\v 7 On the first day of that festival, you all must stop your regular work and you must gather together
\add to worship me\add*. 
\v 8 On each of the next seven days, you must present to me \add several animals to
be\add* an offering\f + \ft Or: sacrifice \f* to be completely burned \add on the
altar\add*. On the seventh day, you all must again stop your regular work and gather to worship me."
\s The festival of the beginning of the harvest 
\p
\v 9 Yahweh also told Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f* 
\v 10 to tell the Israeli people \add about other festivals\add*. He said, "When you arrive in the land which I am giving to
you, and you harvest your crops \add for the first time\add* there, bring to the priest some of the first grain that you
harvest. 
\v 11 On the day after the \add next\add* Sabbath\f + \ft Or: rest \f* day, the priest will lift it up
\add high\add* to \add dedicate it\add* to me, in order that I will accept it as your
\add gift\add*. 
\v 12 That same day, you must sacrifice to me a year-old male lamb that has no defects. You must burn it
\add on the altar\add*. 
\v 13 You must also burn a grain offering. That offering must consist of three quarts\f + \ft Or: 3-1, Or: 2 liters \f* of good flour mixed with
\add olive\add* oil. The smell \add of those things burning\add* will be very pleasing to me. Along with that, you must also
offer a quart\f + \ft Or: liter \f* of wine, which will be a liquid offering. 
\v 14 Do not eat any bread or any roasted grain or unroasted grain on that day until after you have brought those offerings to
me, your God. You must always obey \f + \ft litotes \f* these commands, wherever you live.
\s The festival of the end of the harvest 
\p
\v 15 Seven weeks after the priest offers that grain to me, 
\v 16 50 days after he offers it, \add each family\add* must bring to me an offering from the new crop of grain.
\v 17 From your homes, bring two loaves of bread \add to the priest\add*. He will lift them up
\add high to dedicate them\add* as an offering to me. Those loaves must be baked from three quarts\f + \ft Or: liters \f* of good flour that
has yeast mixed with it. That bread will be an offering to me from the first wheat that you harvest
\add each year\add*. 
\v 18 Along with this bread, you must present to me seven one year-old lambs with no defects, one young bull, and two rams.
They must all be completely burned \add on the altar\add*. All those offerings, with the grain offering and the wine offering,
will be burned, and the smell \add of all those things burning\add* will be very pleasing to me.
\v 19 Then you must also kill one male goat to be an offering\f + \ft Or: sacrifice \f* for your sins, and two one year-old male lambs to be an
offering to enable you to continue to have fellowship with me. 
\v 20 The priest will lift up these offerings \add high to dedicate
them\add* to me. He will also offer the loaves of bread that were baked from the first wheat that you harvest. Those offerings
are sacred to me, but they are for the priests \add to eat\add*.
\v 21 On that day, you must stop your regular work and gather to worship me. You must always obey these instructions\f + \ft Or: commands \f*,
and you must obey them wherever you live. 
\p
\v 22 When you harvest the grain in your fields, do not harvest the grain along the edges of the fields, and do not pick up the
grain that the harvesters drop. Leave that grain for the poor people and for the foreigners who are living among you.
\add Do not forget that it is\add* I, Yahweh your God, \add who am commanding these
things\add*!" 
\s The festival of trumpets 
\p
\v 23 Yahweh also told Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f* 
\v 24 to give these instructions\f + \ft Or: commands \f* to the Israeli people:
"\add Each year\add* in September, on the day that I have appointed, you all must celebrate a day in which you will completely
rest. You must not do any work on that day. When \add the priests\add* blow their trumpets loudly, you all must gather together
to worship me. 
\v 25 All of you must stop doing your regular work on that day. Instead, you must present offerings to me that will be burned
\add on the altar\add*." 
\s The festival of atonement 
\p
\v 26 Yahweh also said to Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f*, 
\v 27 "You must celebrate a day \add on which you request that I\add* forgive you for the sins that you have committed. That
day will be nine days after the festival \add when the priests blow\add* the trumpets. On that day you must fast\f + \ft Or: abstain from
eating food \f*. You must gather together to worship me, and present offerings to me that will be burned
\add on the altar\add*. 
\v 28 You must not do any work on that day, because it is the day when the priests will offer sacrifices to me to atone
for\f + \ft Or: ask me to forgive \f* your sins. 
\v 29 You must expel from your group anyone who does not fast\f + \ft Or: abstain from eating food \f* on that day.
\v 30 And I will get rid of anyone who does any kind of work on that day.
\v 31 You must not work at all! You must always obey these instructions\f + \ft Or: commands \f*, and you must obey them wherever you live.
\v 32 That day will be a day of complete rest for you all, and on that day you must fast\f + \ft Or: abstain from eating food \f*
\add to show that you are sorry for having sinned\add*. That day of rest and fasting\f + \ft Or: abstaining from eating food \f* will begin
on the evening before the day in which you ask me to forgive you for your sins, and it will end on the evening of the following
day." 
\s The festival of shelters 
\p
\v 33 Yahweh also said to Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f*, 
\v 34 "Tell the Israeli people that \add each year\add* they must also celebrate a festival of living in temporary shelters.
That festival will begin five days after the day in which they request me to forgive them for their sins. It will last for
seven days. 
\v 35 On the first day of that festival, the people must gather together to worship me, and they must not do any regular work
on that day. 
\v 36 On each of the seven days of the festival, they must present to me to be an offering
\add animals\add* that will be burned \add on the altar\add*. On the next day, they must gather again to worship me and present
to me another animal that will be burned \add on the altar\add*. That also will be a sacred gathering, and they must not work
on that day, either. 
\p
\v 37 Those are the festivals that I have appointed. Celebrate those sacred festivals by gathering together to present to me
all the various offerings that will be burned \add on the altar\add*â€”animals that will be burned completely, and offerings of
grain, and offerings to enable them to continue to have fellowship with me, and offerings of wine. Each offering must be
brought on the day that I have indicated. 
\v 38 Those festivals must be celebrated\f + \ft Or: You must celebrate those festivals \f* in addition to
\add worshiping on\add* the Sabbath days\f + \ft Or: days of rest \f*. And all those offerings must be given in addition to the offerings
that people personally decide to give, and in addition to the offerings that people make to accompany the solemn promises that
they have made, or offerings that people make voluntarily\f + \ft Or: because they themselves want to \f*.
\p
\v 39 After you have harvested all the crops, you must celebrate this festival of living in temporary shelters. On the first
day and on the last day of that festival, you must rest completely.
\v 40 But on the first day, you are permitted to pick fruit from trees. Cut palm fronds\f + \ft Or: branches \f* and other leafy branches from
trees or from bushes that grow by the streams, \add and make shelters\f + \ft Or: huts \f* to live in for that
week\add*. Then rejoice in my presence for those seven days. 
\v 41 You must celebrate this festival for seven days every year. You must never stop obeying my commands\f + \ft Or: instructions \f* for that
festival. You must celebrate it in September. 
\v 42 During the seven days of that festival, all of you people who have been Israelis all of your lives must live in
shelters\f + \ft Or: huts \f*. 
\v 43 That will remind your descendants that their ancestors lived in shelters
\add for many years\add* after I rescued them from Egypt. \add Do not forget
that\add* I, Yahweh your God, \add am the one who is commanding this\add*."
\p
\v 44 So Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* gave to the Israeli people all those instructions concerning the festivals that Yahweh
\add wanted them to celebrate\add* each year.
