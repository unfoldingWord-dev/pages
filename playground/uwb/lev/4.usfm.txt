\c 4  
\s The sin offering 
\p
\v 1 Then Yahweh said to Moses/me, 
\v 2 “Say this to the Israeli people: This is what must be done if someone sins without intending to sin, doing something that
is forbidden in any of Yahweh's commands. 
\p
\v 3 If the Supreme \f + \fr metonymy \f* Priest sins and causes all the people to be guilty, he must bring to Yahweh a young bull that has no
defects. That will be an offering for the sin that he has committed.
\v 4 He must bring the bull to the entrance to the Sacred Tent. He must lay his hands on its head. Then he must slaughter it in
front of Yahweh \add and catch some of the blood in a bowl\add*.
\v 5 Then the priest must take some of that blood into the Sacred Tent.
\v 6 He must dip \add one of\add* his fingers into the blood and sprinkle it seven times in the presence of Yahweh, in front of
the curtain \add that separates the Holy Place from the Very Holy
Place\add*. 
\v 7 Then he must put some of the blood on the projections at the corners of the altar where fragrant incense is burned in the
Sacred Tent in the presence of Yahweh. The remaining part of the bull's blood
\add that is still in the bowl\add*, he must pour out at the base of the altar where sacrifices are burned completely, at the
entrance to the Sacred Tent. 
\v 8 From that offering the Supreme Priest must separate these things from the bull that is to be burned: the fat that covers
the inner parts of the bull or which is attached to them— 
\v 9 that is, he must burn the kidneys and the fat that is attached to them near the lower back muscle, and the fat that covers
the liver. 
\v 10 That will be just like when the fat is removed from an animal that is sacrificed to maintain good fellowship
\add with Yahweh\add*. Then the Supreme Priest must completely burn those things on the altar.
\v 11 But all the other parts of the animal—its skin/hide and all its other meat, its head and its legs, its inner parts and
the intestines, 
\v 12 he must take outside the camp and throw them in a place that is acceptable to Yahweh, where the ashes are thrown, and he
must burn them in a fire on the pile of ashes. 
\p
\v 13 If all the Israeli people sin without intending to sin, doing something that is forbidden in any of Yahweh's commands,
they will be guilty, even if they do not realize that they have sinned.
\v 14 When they realize that they have committed a sin, together they must bring a young bull to be an offering for their sin,
to the front of the Sacred Tent. 
\v 15 The elders must lay their hands on the bull's head in the presence of Yahweh and slaughter it
\add and catch some of the blood in a bowl\add*. 
\v 16 Then the Supreme \f + \fr metonymy \f* Priest must take some of that blood into the Sacred Tent.
\v 17 He must dip \add one of\add* his fingers into the blood and sprinkle it seven times in the presence of Yahweh, in front
of the curtain \add that separates the Holy Place from the Very Holy
Place\add*. 
\v 18 Then he must put some of the blood on the projections at the corners of the altar that is in the presence of Yahweh in
the Sacred Tent. The remaining part of the bull's blood, he must pour out at the base of the altar where sacrifices are burned
completely, at the entrance of the Sacred Tent. 
\v 19 He must remove all the animal's fat and burn it on the altar.
\v 20 He must do with this bull the same things that he did with the bull that was an offering for his sins, and they will be
forgiven {Yahweh will forgive them}. 
\v 21 Then the priest must take the \add other parts of\add* the bull outside the camp and burn them, like he does when he
himself has sinned. That will be the offering for the sin that all the people have committed, and they will be forgiven.
\p
\v 22 When one of the leaders sins without intending to sin, doing something that is forbidden in any of the commands of Yahweh
his God, he will be guilty. 
\v 23 When he realizes that he has committed a sin, he must bring as his offering a male goat that has no defects.
\v 24 He must lay his hands on the goat's head in the presence of Yahweh and slaughter it at the place where they slaughter
{are slaughtered} the animals that will be completely burned \add on the
altar\add*. That will be an offering for his sin. 
\v 25 Then the priest must put some of the animal's blood \add into a
bowl\add* and dip \add one of\add* his fingers in it and put some of the blood on the corners of the projections of the altar.
Then he must pour out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar.
\v 26 Then he must burn all the fat on the altar, like was done with the fat of the offering to maintain good fellowship
\add with Yahweh\add*. As a result of the priest's doing that, the leader will no longer be guilty for his sin and he will be
forgiven. 
\p
\v 27 If one of the other Israeli people sins without intending to sin, and does something that is forbidden in any of the
commands of Yahweh his God, he will be guilty. 
\v 28 When he realizes that he has committed a sin, he must bring as his offering a female goat that has no defects.
\v 29 He must lay his hands on the goat's head and slaughter it at the place where they slaughter the animals that will be
completely burned \add on the altar, and catch some of it in a bowl\add*.
\v 30 Then the priest must dip \add one of\add* his fingers in it, and put some of the blood on the projections at the corners
of the altar. Then he must pour out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar.
\v 31 Then he must remove all the goat's fat, and burn all the fat on the altar, like was done with the fat of the offering to
maintain fellowship \add with Yahweh\add*. And the aroma while it burns will be pleasing to Yahweh. As a result of the priest
doing that, the person will no longer be guilty for his sin, and he will be forgiven.
\p
\v 32 If that person brings a lamb to be his offering for sin, he must bring a female lamb that has no defects.
\v 33 He must lay his hands on the lamb's head and slaughter it at the place where they slaughter the animals that will be
completely burned \add on the altar, and catch some of the blood in a
bowl\add*. 
\v 34 Then the priest must dip \add one of\add* his fingers in it and put some of the blood on the projections at the corners
of the altar. Then he must pour out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar.
\v 35 Then he must remove all the lamb's fat, and burn all the fat on the altar, like was done with the fat of the offering to
maintain fellowship \add with Yahweh\add*. He must burn it on top of the he other offerings to Yahweh that are being burned. As
a result, the priest will request God to forgive that person for his sin, and he will be forgiven.
