\c 16  
\s The Day of Atonement 
\p
\v 1 After the two sons of Aaron died because they burned incense to Yahweh
\add in a manner that was contrary to what Yahweh commanded\add*, Yahweh spoke to Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f*.
\v 2 He said to him\f + \ft Or: me \f*, “Warn you \add older\add* brother Aaron that he must not enter the very holy place inside the curtain
that is in the Sacred Tent whenever he wants to, because the cover of the sacred chest is there. That is the place where the
priest makes atonement for\f + \ft Or: requests me to forgive \f* sins. I will be present in the cloud that is over the cover of the sacred
chest. If Aaron goes in that room when it is not the proper time, he will die!
\p
\v 3 When Aaron enters the Sacred Tent area, he must bring a bull that
\add will be killed\add* to become an offering\f + \ft Or: sacrifice \f* for sins, and a ram
\add to be killed\add* to be an offering that will be completely burned
\add on the altar\add*. 
\v 4 Then he must bathe his whole body, and put on the underwear\f + \ft Or: undershorts \f* and the linen tunic\f + \ft Or: vest \f*. He must tie the linen
sash\f + \ft Or: waistbands \f* around his waist and wrap the turban around his head. Those are his sacred garments.
\v 5 The Israeli people must then bring to him two male goats \add to be
killed\add* as an offering\f + \ft Or: sacrifice \f* for sin, and a ram to be \add killed
and\add* burned completely \add on the altar\add*. 
\p
\v 6 Aaron must offer the bull \add to me\add* to be a sacrifice in order that I will forgive his sins and for the sins of his
family {his sins and the sins of his family will be forgiven}. 
\v 7 Then he must bring the two male goats to me at the entrance to the Sacred Tent.
\v 8 He must cast lots\f + \ft Or: throw down stones that have been marked \f* to determine which goat
\add will be sacrificed\add* to me, and which will be the goat that will be set free.
\v 9 Aaron must bring to me the goat that was chosen to be sacrificed. It will be an offering for the people's sins.
\v 10 Aaron must also bring to me the other goat. But it is not to be killed. It will be freed while it is still alive. As a
result of Aaron sending it into the desert, the people's sins will be forgiven.
\p
\v 11 Then Aaron must bring the young bull to me, to be an offering\f + \ft Or: sacrifice \f* for himself and for his family. He must slaughter
that bull to be an offering for their sins \add and he must drain the blood into a
basin\add*. 
\v 12 Then he must take some burning coals from the \add bronze\add* altar and put them in the incense burner. Then he must
fill his hands with fragrant finely-ground incense. Then he must take the incense and the incense burner inside the curtain
into the inner room \add of the Sacred Tent\add*. 
\v 13 There he must put the incense on the burning coals, with the result that a cloud of burning incense will rise up over the
lid of the sacred chest. If he obeys these instructions, he will not die
\add like Korah did because of offering incense incorrectly\add* \f + \ft Or:
\add because of being in God's presence\add* \f*. 
\v 14 Then he must dip his finger into \add the basin\add* and sprinkle some blood on the lid of the sacred chest, and also
sprinkle some blood seven times against the front of the chest. 
\p
\v 15 Then Aaron must slaughter the goat to be an offering for the sins of the people. Then he must bring its blood into the
room behind the curtain. There he must sprinkle that blood on the lid of the sacred chest and against the front of the chest,
like he did with the bull's blood. 
\v 16 By doing that, he will purify the very holy place. And he must do the same thing for the Sacred Tent, because the tent is
in the midst of the camp of the Israeli people who have become unacceptable to me
\add because of their sins\add*. 
\v 17 When Aaron goes into the very holy place \add in the Sacred
Tent\add* to purify it, no one else is permitted to enter \add the other part
of\add* the Sacred Tent. Only after Aaron has performed rituals to enable me to forgive him and his family, and all the Israeli
people, is anyone permitted to enter the Sacred Tent. 
\p
\v 18 Then Aaron must go outside the tent to purify my altar. He must do this by smearing some of the blood from the bull and
some of the blood from the goat on each of the projections at the corners of the altar.
\v 19 Then Aaron must dip his finger into the \add basin of\add* blood and sprinkle some of the blood over the altar seven
times. By doing that, he will cleanse it from being unholy \add because of the
sins\add* of the Israeli people, and it will become holy again. 
\p
\v 20 When Aaron has finished purifying the very holy place \add inside the Sacred
Tent\add* and all of the Sacred Tent and the altar, he must bring the goat that was chosen to be set free.
\v 21 He must put both of his hands on the head of the goat, and confess all the sins \f + \ft doublet \f* of the Israeli people. By doing
that, he will put \add the guilt of\add* their sins on the head of the goat. Then he must give the goat to a man who is chosen,
and that man will send the goat out into the desert. 
\v 22  \add It is as though\add* the goat will carry away into the desert
\add the guilt for\add* the sins of all the people. 
\p
\v 23 When Aaron goes back into the Sacred Tent, he must take off the linen clothes that he wore when he
\add previously\add* entered the very holy place, and he must leave those clothes there.
\v 24 Then he must bathe in a sacred place, put on his regular\f + \ft Or: ordinary \f* clothes, and go out to sacrifice the animals that will
be burned completely on the altar, for his own sins and for the sins of the Israeli people. By doing that he will enable Yahweh
to forgive him and them. 
\v 25 He must also burn on the altar all the fat of the two animals that were sacrificed.
\p
\v 26 The man who was chosen to send the goat into the desert and free it there must afterwards wash his clothes and bathe.
Then he may return to the camp. 
\v 27 The carcasses of the bull and the goat that were slaughtered to be an offering\f + \ft Or: sacrifice \f* for the people's sins, whose
blood was taken inside the very holy place to enable Yahweh to forgive the Israeli people, must be carried outside the camp and
burned. The hides\f + \ft Or: skins \f* of the animals, the inner organs, and the dung must also be burned.
\v 28 The man who burns those things must then wash his clothes and bathe before he returns to the camp.
\p
\v 29 In October\f + \ft Or: In the month after the dry season ends \f*, on the day that I have appointed, you all must ◄fast, Or: abstain from
eating food► and not do any work. This is a rule\f + \ft Or: law \f* that will never end. It must be obeyed by you people who have been
Israelis all your lives, and also by foreigners who are living among you.
\v 30 On that day, Aaron will perform rituals to enable me to forgive you all, and then I will cleanse\f + \ft Or: free \f* you all from
\add the gullt of\add* all your sins. 
\v 31 That will be a day for you to rest and not do any work, like the Sabbath days, and you must ◄fast\f + \ft Or: abstain \f* from eating
food► all that day. That is a permanent command\f + \ft Or: law \f* for you all to obey.
\v 32 In future years, this ritual\f + \ft Or: ceremony \f* to enable me to forgive you all \f + \ft doublet \f* will be performed by the Supreme Priest who
is anointed \add with olive oil\add* and appointed to serve instead of his ancestor Aaron. He must put on the sacred clothes
made of linen 
\v 33 and offer sacrifices to purify the very holy place, all of the Sacred Tent, the altar, the priests, and all the Israel
people \add like Aaron did\add*. 
\v 34 This will be a permanent command\f + \ft Or: law \f* for you to obey once every year, to enable Yahweh to forgive you Israeli people for
the sins that you have committed.” 
\p Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* obeyed all those instructions\f + \ft Or: commands \f* that Yahweh had given to him\f + \ft Or: me \f*.
