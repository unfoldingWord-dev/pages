\c 17  
\s Where sacrifices are to be offered 
\p
\v 1 Yahweh also said to Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f*, 
\v 2 "Speak to Aaron and his sons and to all the other Israeli people, and say this to them: 'This is what Yahweh has
commanded: 
\v 3 "If you sacrifice an ox or a lamb or a goat, you must bring it
\add to the priest\add* at the entrance of the Sacred Tent, to present\f + \ft Or: offer \f* it to me there.
\v 4 If you slaughter it to be a sacrifice anywhere else in the camp or outside the camp, you will be guilty of shedding its
blood \add in an unacceptable place\add*. As a result you will no longer be allowed to be\f + \ft Or: associate \f* with my people.
\v 5 That rule is in order that you Israeli people, instead of offering sacrifices in the open fields, will offer them to me by
taking them to the priest at the entrance of the Sacred Tent, to be offerings to maintain fellowship
\add with me\add*. 
\v 6  \add After the animal is slaughtered\add*, the priest must sprinkle some of its blood against the altar at the entrance
of the Sacred Tent, and burn its fat to be an aroma that is pleasing to me.
\v 7 You people must no longer give sacrifices to the demons that resemble goats which you are worshiping. You people must obey
this command forever." ' 
\p
\v 8 And tell this to them: 'If any Israeli or any foreigner who is living among them brings an offering that is to be
completely burned \add on the altar\add* or any other sacrifice 
\v 9 and does not being it to the entrance of the Sacred Tent to be a sacrifice to me, that person will no longer be allowed to
associate with my people. 
\p
\v 10 I will reject [IDI] any Israeli or any foreigner who is living among you who eats any blood, and I
\add will command that he\add* no longer be allowed to associate with my people.
\v 11 That is because the life of every creature is in its blood; I have declared that it is blood that is to be offered on the
altar to enable people to be forgiven for their sins. 
\v 12 That is who is why I say that you Israelis must not eat blood, and the foreigners who live among you must also not eat
blood. 
\p
\v 13 Any Israeli or any foreigner who is living among you who hunts any animal or bird that is permitted for you to eat, must
drain out the blood \add of any animal or bird that he kills\add* and cover the blood with dirt.
\v 14 This is because no creature is alive if it does not have blood. And that is why I have said that \f + \ft doublet \f* to you Israelis,
and anyone who eats blood must no longer \add be allowed to associate with my
people\add*. 
\p
\v 15 Anyone in Israel, including foreigners, who eats any of the meat of any creature that is found dead, or that had been
killed by wild animals, must wash his clothes and bathe. Then he must not touch anyone until that evening.
\v 16 If he does not do those things, he will be punished for what he did.' "
