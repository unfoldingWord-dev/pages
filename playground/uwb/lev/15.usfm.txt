\c 15  
\s Discharges from bodies 
\p
\v 1 Yahweh also said to Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f* and Aaron, 
\v 2 “Tell this to the Israelis: When an unusual fluid comes out of a man's sexual organs \\f + \\ft euphemism \\f*, that fluid should not be
touched. 
\v 3 Whether that fluid is blocked or continues to drip, it causes him to be someone who should not be touched.
\p
\v 4 And any bed that such a man lies on should not be touched, and anything that he sits on should not be touched.
\v 5 Anyone who touches his bed must wash his clothes and bathe, and no one should touch him until that evening.
\v 6 Anyone who sits on something that man has sat on must wash his clothes and bathe, and no one should touch him until that
evening. 
\p
\v 7 Anyone who touches such a man must wash his clothes and bathe, and no one should touch him until that evening.
\p
\v 8 If such a man spits on someone else, that person should not be touched. He must wash his clothes, and no one should touch
him until that evening. 
\p
\v 9 Everything that a man who has such a flow of fluid sits on while he is riding
\add a horse or a donkey\add* should not be touched, 
\v 10 and anyone who touches the seat or saddle that he was sitting on also should not be touched until that evening. And
anyone who picks up those things must wash his clothes and bathe, and no one should touch him until that evening.
\v 11 Anyone whom the man with such a flow of fluid from his body touches without first rinsing his hands in water must wash
his clothes and bathe, and no one should touch him until that evening.
\p
\v 12 If such a man touches a clay pot, that pot must be broken. Anything made from wood that he touches must be rinsed in
water. 
\p
\v 13 If such a man is healed from his flow of fluid, he must wait for seven days. Then he must wash his clothes and bathe in
water from a spring. Then he will be able to be with others. 
\v 14 On the eighth\f + \ft Or: next \f* day, he must take two doves or two young pigeons and come in front of Yahweh at the entrance of the
Sacred Tent, and give them to the priest. 
\v 15 The priest will sacrifice them. One will be an offering for the man to become acceptable to God, and the other one will
be completely burned \add on the altar\add*. As a result of the priest doing that, the man will no longer be guilty for having
sinned. 
\p
\v 16 When semen accidentally flows from a man's sexual organs \\f + \\ft euphemism \\f*, he must bathe his whole body, and no one should touch him
until that evening. 
\v 17 Any clothing or leather that has semen on it must be washed, and no one should touch it until that evening.
\v 18 When a man has sex with a woman and some semen spills, both of them must bathe, and no one should touch them until that
evening. 
\p
\v 19 When a woman has her monthly menstrual period, no one should touch her for seven days. If anyone touches her
\add during that time\add*, no one should touch that person until that evening.
\v 20 No one should touch anything that she lies on or sits on during that time.
\v 21 Anyone who touches her bed must wash his clothes and bathe, and no one should touch that person until that evening.
\v 22-23 Anyone who touches something that she has been sitting on, a bed or anything else, must wash his clothes, and no one
should touch that person until that evening. 
\p
\v 24 If a man has sex with a woman \add during that time\add* and some of the menstrual blood touches him, no one should touch
him for seven days, and no one should touch the bed that he lies on.
\p
\v 25 When a woman has a flow of blood for ◄many days\f + \ft Or: a \f* long time►, which is not her monthly flow of blood, or if her flow of
blood continues after her monthly flow ends, no one should touch her until it stops.
\v 26 And no one should touch the bed that she lies on or anything that she sits on while that flow of blood continues, just
like during her monthly menstrual period. 
\v 27 Anyone who touches those things should not touch anyone else; he must wash his clothes and bathe, and he should not touch
anyone else until that evening. 
\p
\v 28 After a woman's monthly menstrual flow ends, she must wait seven days before she touches anyone.
\v 29 On the eighth\f + \ft Or: next \f* day, she must take two doves or two pigeons to the priest at the entrance of the Sacred Tent.
\v 30 The priest will sacrifice one of them to be an offering to enable her to become acceptable to Yahweh again, and
completely burn the other one \add on the altar\add*. By doing that he will cause Yahweh to consider her no longer guilty for
having sinned \\f + \\ft doublet \\f*. 
\p
\v 31 You must warn the Israeli people not to do things that ◄defile them\f + \ft Or: cause \f* them to be unacceptable to me►. If they become
◄unacceptable to me\f + \ft Or: defiled \f*►, they will defile my Sacred Tent which is among them, and as a result they will die.”
\p
\v 32 Those are the regulations for a man who has a fluid that flows from his sexual organs or who should not be touched
because some of his semen spills while having sex \add with a woman\add*,
\v 33 and for any woman during her monthly menstrual period, and for any man who has sex with a woman during her menstrual
period.
