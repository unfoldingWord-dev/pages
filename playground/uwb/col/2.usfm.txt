\s Colossians 2:1-5 
\s I am exerting myself very greatly on your behalf in order that you might truly know the message about Christ, in order that
no one might delude you. 
\p
\v 1 In particular, I want you to realize that I am exerting myself very greatly\f + \ft Or: working very hard \f* on your behalf, on behalf
of those who are in Laodicea \add city\add*, and on behalf of all those others who have not seen me personally.
\v 2 I am doing this in order that they and you \f + \ft synecdoche \f* might be strengthened
\add spiritually\add* as you are united in loving \add one another\add*. And I am doing this in order that they and you might
fully and thoroughly \f + \ft doublet \f* understand the message that God has now revealed; that is, in order that they and you might truly
know the message from God our Father and about Christ, 
\v 3 who alone is able to cause them and you to understand thoroughly \f + \ft doublet \f*
\add this very important message\add*. 
\v 4 I am telling you this in order that no one may deceive you by means of arguing persuasively;
\v 5 because, even though I am absent from you physically, I am very concerned about you. At the same time, I am rejoicing
because I know that you are united \add with each other\add* and that you believe firmly in Christ.
\s Colossians 2:6-7 
\s Conduct yourselves as those who are united to such a one as Christ Jesus our Lord should conduct themselves.
\p
\v 6 In a way that is consistent\f + \ft Or: in harmony \f* with \add the message
that\add* you received about Christ Jesus, who is our Lord, conduct yourselves as you should, since you have a close
relationship with such a one as he is. 
\v 7 Specifically, continue believing and practicing \f + \ft metaphor, doublet \f* what you were first taught about Christ. Continue to do this
more and more; continue to be sure about all the true teaching, just like
\add Epaphras\add* taught it to you. And continue thanking \add God, our
Father\add*, very much \add for all that he has done for you\add*.
\s Colossians 2:8-15 
\s Make sure that no one makes you become his disciples by teaching you a false religious philosophy, since you are spiritually
complete because you are united to Christ. 
\p
\v 8 Make sure that no one forces you\add \f + \ft plural \f*\add* to become his disciples \f + \ft metaphor \f* by his teaching you a religious
philosophy\f + \ft Or: doctrine \f* that is valueless and false. Such a philosophy is false because it teaches what mere human beings think,
because it teaches people elementary regulations\f + \ft Or: rules \f* \add that are concerned merely with what is
external\f + \ft Or: physical \f*\add*, and because it teaches what is contrary to
\add the true teaching about\add* Christ. 
\v 9  \add Make sure of this\add*, because it is in Christ's body that God lives completely.
\v 10 And \add make sure of it\add* because you are spiritually complete because you have a close relationship with Christ, who
rules over every being that rules. 
\v 11 Specifically, because of your close relationship with him, it is as though \f + \ft metaphor \f* you were circumcised \f + \ft Or:Christ circumcised
you \f* \add spiritually\add*. This does not mean that someone circumcised you physically \f + \ft metonymy \f*, but it means that Christ
completely removed your entire self-directed nature. 
\v 12 And specifically, when you were baptized, \add it was as though\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* you
\add had died and\add* were buried with Christ, and \add it was as
though\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* God caused you to live again with Christ as a result of your believing that God acted powerfully,
specifically, by your believing that God raised Christ from among dead people.
\v 13 And specifically, you \add who are non-Jews\add*, because of your sins, you were
\add spiritually\add* dead \add before you trusted in Christ\add*. You were uncircumcised
\add spiritually;\add* that is, your self-directed nature controlled you. Nevertheless, it was you whom God caused to become
alive \add spiritually\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* with Christ. And specifically, God forgave us all our sins.
\v 14  \add It is just\add* as \add though\add* he canceled the document\f + \ft Or: paper \f*
\add that stated\add* \add the charges\add* against us\f + \ft Or: the sins
\add that we had committed\add* \f* for which \add God\add* will punish us. And
\add it was just\add* as \add though\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* it was that document\f + \ft Or: paper \f* that he removed by nailing it to the cross
\add when they nailed Christ on the cross\add*. 
\v 15 And specifically, God defeated the \add evil\add* spirit beings that rule, and he demonstrated\f + \ft Or: showed \f* that publicly; that
is, he triumphed over them as a result of what \add Christ did\add*.
\s Colossians 2:16-19 
\s Disregard those who condemn you because you do not obey certain regulations and because you do not worship God as they
insist that you should. 
\p
\v 16 So disregard anyone who says that God will punish you because you eat
\add certain foods\add* and because you drink \add certain drinks\add* or because
\add you do not celebrate\add* special \add yearly\add* festivals or celebrate the time when the new moon
\add appears\add* or weekly Sabbaths\f + \ft Or: Jewish days of rest \f*. 
\v 17  \add Disregard such people\add* because those \add regulations\f + \ft Or: rules \f* about food and drink and
festivals\add* are \add only\add* like a shadow \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add that is cast by something that is approaching; that is, they merely
represent\add* the real spiritual blessings that Christ \add has given to
you\add*. 
\v 18 Disregard those who say that God will punish you because \add you do not worship God in the way
that\add* they say \add that you should\add*; that is, they insist that you should humiliate yourselves and that you should
worship the angels. \add Disregard such people\add* since they base their authority on things that they have never seen, and
since they are proud without reason because their self-directed nature
\add controls\add* what they think, 
\v 19 and since they do not teach the true teaching about Christ
\f + \ft metaphor \f*\add . Christ is the one who causes all of his people to develop\f + \ft Or: grow \f* spiritually as God plans that they should
develop\f + \ft Or: grow \f*, just like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* a person's head directs how his body grows, as it is held together by its joints and
ligaments. 
\s Colossians 2:20-23 
\s Do not submit to elementary regulations, which are concerned merely with what is external.
\p
\v 20  \add It is as though\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* you died with Christ. So \add you no longer have to
obey\add* elementary regulations\f + \ft Or: rules \f* \add that are concerned merely with what is external\f + \ft Or: physical \f*, just like a dead person
no longer has to do anything\add*. So, do not submit to regulations\f + \ft Or: rules \f*
\v 21 such as 'Do not handle \add certain things\add*,' 'Do not taste
\add certain things\add*,' 'Do not touch \add certain things\add*,' as if you still had to obey such regulations\f + \ft Or: rules \f*.
\v 22 All those things are intended to cease to exist when we use them.
\add And do not submit to such regulations\f + \ft Or: rules \f*\add*, because they are what mere human teachers command and teach.
\v 23  \add Do not obey such\add* regulations\f + \ft Or: rules \f* because they only cause people to do what their self-directed nature wants
to do. \add Those regulations\add* seem to be wise because they \add urge people
to\add* worship as mere human teachers have decided. \add They urge\add* that
\add people\add* should humiliate themselves, and that \add people\add* should treat their bodies harshly. But those
regulations\f + \ft Or: rules \f* do not help \add people\add* at all to not do the sinful things that their self-directed nature wants to do.
