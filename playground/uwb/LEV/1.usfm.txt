\s The burnt offering 
\p
\v 1 While Moses/I was \add standing near the entrance to\add* the Sacred Tent, Yahweh called to him/me from inside the tent.
He said to Moses/me, 
\v 2 “Tell this to the Israeli people: When any of you brings an offering to Yahweh, bring one of your sheep or goats or
cattle. 
\p
\v 3 If what you are offering is a bull that will be completely burned
\add on the altar\add*, it must be without any defect. You must take it to the entrance to the Sacred Tent, in order that it
will be acceptable to Yahweh. 
\v 4 You must lay your hands on the head of the bull. When you do that, Yahweh will accept it to forgive/pardon you for the
sins that you have committed. 
\v 5 You must slaughter the young bull in front of Yahweh. Then Aaron's sons, who are priests, will bring the blood and
sprinkle it against all sides of the altar, near the entrance to the Sacred Tent.
\v 6 You must remove the skin of the animal and cut the animal into pieces. You must wash the inner parts and the legs of the
bull. 
\v 7 Then Aaron's sons will put wood on the altar and light a fire.
\v 8 Then they will arrange the pieces, including the head and the fat, on the burning wood.
\v 9 Then one of the priests will completely burn all of it on the altar. And the aroma will be pleasing to Yahweh.
\p
\v 10 If you are offering a sheep or a goat, it must be a male without any defect.
\v 11 You must slaughter it in front of Yahweh, on the north side of the altar
\add and drain all the blood into a bowl\add*. Then Aaron's sons will sprinkle the blood against all sides of the altar.
\v 12 You must cut the animal into pieces. You must wash the inner parts and the legs of the animal. Then the priests will
arrange the pieces, including the head and the fat, on the burning wood.
\v 13 Then one of the priests will take all of it and completely burn all of it on the altar. And the aroma as it burns will be
pleasing to Yahweh. 
\p
\v 14 If what you are offering to Yahweh is birds, you must offer a dove or a young pigeon.
\v 15 The priest will take it to the altar and wring/twist off its head. Then he will burn the head on the altar. He will drain
out the bird's blood onto the side of the altar. 
\v 16 Then he will remove the bird's ◄craw/food-grinding pouch► and what is inside it, and throw it on the east side of the
altar, where the ashes are thrown. 
\v 17 Then he will grasp the bird's wings and partially tear the bird open. Then he will burn it completely in the fire on the
altar. And the aroma will be pleasing to Yahweh.”
