\c 20  
\s Punishments for various sins 
\p
\v 1 Yahweh also said this to Moses/me: 
\v 2 Tell the Israeli people, “Any Israeli or any foreigner who is living in Israel who sacrifices any of his children to be an
offering to the god Molech must be executed. The people of the town must kill him by throwing stones at him.
\v 3 I will reject [IDI] such people and cause that they are no longer be allowed to associate with my people.
\v 4 If the people of someone's town ignore it when he kills one of his children to offer him as a sacrifice to Molech, and if
they do not execute that person, 
\v 5 I myself will punish that person and his family, and I will command that he no longer be able to associate with my people.
And I will do the same thing to any others who do the same thing that he did to worship Molech.
\p
\v 6 I will reject [IDI] those who go to those who ◄consult/talk with► the spirits of dead people and fortune-tellers to seek
advice from them. I will command that they no longer be allowed to associate with my people.
\p
\v 7 Set yourselves apart and be holy, because I, Yahweh your God am holy,
\add and I want you to be like me\add*. 
\v 8 Obey carefully [DOU] all my laws. I am Yahweh, the one will cause you to be holy.
\p
\v 9 If anyone curses his father or his mother, he must be executed. He himself will be responsible for his own death [MTY].
\p
\v 10 If a man commits adultery with some other man's wife, both of them, the man and the woman, must be executed.
\p
\v 11 If a man has sex with [EUP] one of his father's other wives, he has disgraced his father. So both that man and that woman
must be executed, but they themselves will be responsible for their own deaths [MTY].
\p
\v 12 If a man has sex with [EUP] his daughter-in-law, both of them must be executed. What they have done is very perverse; and
they will be responsible for their own deaths [MTY]. 
\p
\v 13 If two men have sex together, they have done something detestable. They must both be executed, but they will be
responsible for their own deaths [MTY]. 
\p
\v 14 If a man marries both a woman and her mother, that is a wicked thing. All three of them must be burned to death, in order
that such a wicked practice will not \add continue to be done\add* among you.
\p
\v 15 If a man has sex with an animal, he must be executed, and you must also kill that animal.
\p
\v 16  \add Similarly\add*, if a woman has sex with an animal, both the woman and that animal must be killed [DOU], but they
will be responsible for their own deaths [MTY]. 
\p
\v 17 I a man marries his sister, the daughter of either his mother or his father, and they have sex together, that is
disgraceful. They must not be allowed to continue to associate with my people. And because he has disgraced his sister, he must
be punished. 
\p
\v 18 If a man has sex with [EUP, DOU] a woman during her monthly menstrual period, they have both revealed why she was
bleeding, so both of them must not be allowed to associate with my people anymore.
\p
\v 19 Do not have sex with the sister of either your father or your mother, because that would be disgracing someone who is a
close relative. And you and the woman must both be punished. 
\p
\v 20 If a man has sex [EUP] with his aunt, he has dishonored his uncle. I will punish both of them by causing them to die
without having any children. 
\p
\v 21 If a man marries his brother's wife \add while his brother is still
living\add*, that is disgraceful. He has dishonored his brother; and they both will die without having any children.
\p
\v 22 Obey all my laws/decrees [DOU] carefully, in order that you will not be forced to leave [MET] the land to which I am
bringing you. 
\v 23 Do not imitate/adopt the customs of the people of the land from which I will expel them as you advance. I hated them
because they did all those things. 
\v 24 But I said to you, ‘You will take their land from them; I will give it to you to be yours, a land that is very fertile
[IDI]. I am Yahweh your God, who has set you apart from the people of other nations.’
\p
\v 25 So you must distinguish between birds and animals that are unacceptable to me and those that are acceptable to me. Do not
defile themselves by \add eating\add* birds or animals, or anything that crawls along on the ground, that I have said are
unacceptable for you. 
\v 26 You must act in ways that I consider to be holy, because I, Yahweh, am holy, and I have set you apart from the
\add ungodly people of other\add* nations to belong to me. 
\p
\v 27 You must execute any man or woman among you who ◄consults/talks with► the spirits of dead people or who is a
fortune-teller. Kill them by \add throwing\add* stones at them; but they will be responsible for their own deaths.”
