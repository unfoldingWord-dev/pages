\s Rituals for those healed of contagious skin diseases 
\p
\v 1 Yahweh also said to Moses/me, 
\v 2 “These are the regulations for anyone who has been healed of a contagious skin disease.
\v 3 The person must be brought to the priest. The priest will take him outside the camp
\add to where that person has been staying\add*, and examine him. If the skin disease has been healed,
\v 4 the priest will say that someone must bring two living birds that are acceptable to Yahweh, along with some cedar wood,
some scarlet/red yarn, and some springs of ◄hyssop/a very leafy plant►.
\v 5 Then the priest will command that one of the birds be killed while
\add it is being held\add* over a clay pot containing water from a spring.
\v 6 Then the priest will dip the other bird, along with the cedar wood, the scarlet/red yarn and the hyssop, into the blood of
the bird that was killed. 
\v 7 Then he must sprinkle some of the blood on the person who was healed; he must sprinkle it on him seven times. Then he will
declare that the person it permitted to be with other people again. And the priest will release that bird and allow it to fly
away. 
\p
\v 8 Then the person who was healed must wash his clothes, shave off all his hair, and bathe. Then he is allowed to return to
the camp, but he must stay outside his tent for seven days. 
\v 9 On the seventh day, he must again shave off all his hair, including his beard and his eyebrows. The he must again wash his
clothes and bathe, and then he will be allowed to be with other people again.
\p
\v 10 The next day that person must bring two male lambs and one female lamb that is a year-old, all of them with no defects.
He must also bring six quarts/liters of fine flour, mixed with olive oil, to be an offering, and ◄0.6 of a pint/0.3 of a liter►
of olive oil. 
\v 11 The priest who declares that the person's skin disease is ended must bring that person and his offerings to Yahweh at the
entrance of the Sacred Tent. 
\p
\v 12 Then the priest must take one of the male lambs and lift it up, along with the olive oil, in front of Yahweh, to be a
guilt offering — an offering for his being guilty for not giving to Yahweh the things that he was required to give him.
\v 13 Then the priest must slaughter the lamb in the sacred place where the other sacrifices are offered. Like the offering to
cause people to become acceptable to God, this guilt offering is holy, and belongs to the priest.
\v 14 The priest must take some of the blood of that animal and pour it on the lobe/tip of the right ear and on the thumb of
the right hand and on the big toe of the right foot of the one whose skin disease has ended.
\v 15 Then the priest must take some of the olive oil and pour it in the palm of his own left hand.
\v 16 Then he must dip the forefinger of his right hand into the oil in his palm, and sprinkle it in front of Yahweh seven
times. 
\v 17 Then he must put some of the oil that is still in the palm of his hand on the lobe/tip of the right ear and the thumb of
the right hand and on the big toe of the right foot of the person whose skin disease has ended. He must put it on top of the
blood that he has already put on those places. 
\v 18 The remaining oil in his palm must be put on the person's head,
\add to indicate that Yahweh declares that\add* the person has been forgiven for having sinned.
\p
\v 19 Then the priest must slaughter one of the other two animals, to show that the one whose skin disease has ended has been
forgiven for having sinned, and that he has become acceptable to Yahweh. Then the priest will slaughter the animal that will be
completely burned \add on the altar\add*. 
\v 20 He will also put on the altar the offering made from grain, to indicate that the person has been forgiven for having
sinned. Then that person will be allowed to be with other people.
\p
\v 21 But if the person whose skin disease is ended is poor and cannot afford to bring all those animals, he must take to the
priest one male lamb to be lifted up to be an offering for his not giving to Yahweh the things that he was required to give
him. He must also take 2 quarts/liters of fine flour mixed with olive oil to be an offering made from grain, 0.6 pint/0.3 liter
of olive oil, 
\v 22 and two doves or two young pigeons, one for him to become acceptable to Yahweh and one to be completely burned
\add on the altar\add*. 
\p
\v 23 On that same day, that person must take those things to the priest at the entrance of the Sacred Tent, to offer them to
Yahweh. 
\v 24 The priest will take the lamb for the offering for that person not giving to Yahweh the things that he was required to
give him, along with the olive oil, and lift them up in front of Yahweh.
\v 25 Then the priest will slaughter that lamb \add and catch some of the blood in a
bowl\add*, and take some of it and put it on the lobe/tip of the person's right ear and on the thumb of his right hand and on
the big toe of his right foot. 
\v 26 Then the priest will pour some of the oil into the palm of his left hand,
\v 27 and with his right forefinger he must sprinkle some of the oil from his palm there in the presence of Yahweh.
\v 28 He must put some of the oil in his palm on the same places where he put the blood.
\v 29 He must put the rest of the oil that is in his hand on the head of the person whose skin disease is ended, to indicate
that Yahweh has forgiven him for having sinned. 
\v 30 Then the priest must sacrifice the doves or the pigeons, whichever that person has brought.
\v 31 One will be a sin offering and the other will be completely burned on the altar, along with the offering made from grain.
By doing that, the priest will declare that the person is no longer guilty for having sinned.
\p
\v 32 Those are the regulations for anyone who has a contagious skin disease and who is poor and cannot afford the usual
offerings, in order that he can be with people again.” 
\s Instructions regarding mildew in a house 
\p
\v 33 Yahweh also said to Aaron and Moses/me, 
\v 34 “I am about to give you Canaan land to belong to your people permanently. When you enter that land, there will be times
when I cause/allow mildew to appear inside one of your houses. 
\v 35 If that happens, the owner of that house must go to the priest and tell him, ‘There is something in my house that looks
like mildew.’ 
\v 36 Then the priest will say to him, ‘Take everything out of the house before I enter the house to examine the mildew. If you
do not do that, I will declare that everything in the house is contaminated.’
\v 37  \add After the owner takes everything outside of his house\add*, the priest will go in and inspect the house. If the
mildew has caused greenish or reddish spots/depressions on the walls that seem to be deeper than only on the surface of the
walls, 
\v 38 the priest will go outside of the house and lock it up for seven days.
\v 39 On the seventh day, he must go into the house and inspect it again. If the mildew on the walls has spread,
\v 40 the priest will tell someone to tear out and throw in the dump outside the town all the stones in the walls that have
mildew on them. 
\v 41 Then the owner must scrape all the walls inside the house, and everything that is scraped off must be thrown into a dump
outside the town. 
\v 42 Then the owner must get new/other stones to replace the ones that had mildew on them, and take new clay and plaster
\add to cover the stones in the walls\add* the house. 
\p
\v 43 If the mildew appears again in the house after that is done,
\v 44 the priest must go and examine the house again. If the mildew has spread inside the house, it will be clear that the
mildew is the kind that destroys \add houses\add*, and no one will be allowed to live in it.
\v 45 It must be completely torn down—the stones, the timber and the plaster—and all those things must be thrown into a dump
outside the town. 
\p
\v 46 Anyone who goes into that house while it is locked up will not be allowed to be with other people until sunset of that
day. 
\v 47 Anyone who sleeps in that house or eats in that house \add during that
time\add* must wash his clothes. 
\p
\v 48 But when the priest comes to examine the house after it has been plastered, if the mildew has not spread, he shall
declare that people may live in it, because the mildew is gone. 
\v 49 But before people are allowed to live in it, the priest must take two small birds and some cedar wood and some
red/scarlet yarn and some hyssop. 
\v 50 He must kill one of the birds while \add holding it\add* over a clay pot containing water from a spring.
\v 51 Then he must take the cedar wood, the hyssop, the red/scarlet yarn, and the other/living bird, and dip them into the
blood of the dead bird, and sprinkle some of that blood on the house seven times.
\v 52 By doing all those things he will enable the house to be lived in again.
\v 53 Then he must release the other bird and allow it to fly away. By doing that, he will
\add finish the ritual for\add* causing the house to be acceptable for people to live in it again.
\p
\v 54 Those are the regulations for contagious diseases, for itching sores,
\v 55 for mildew [DOU] on clothes or in a house, 
\v 56 and for swellings, rashes, or bright spots \add on sores\add*,
\v 57 to determine whether people will still be permitted to touch those things or not.”
