\s 2 Peter 3:1-2 
\s I am writing this letter to you in order to stimulate you to remember what the holy prophets said and what our Lord and
Savior commanded. 
\p
\v 1 This letter that I am now writing to you whom I love, is the second
\add letter\add* that I have written to you. \add I have written
both\add* these \add letters to you in order that\add* by reminding you
\add about the things you already know, I may\add* stimulate/cause you to think sincerely
\add about those things\add*. 
\v 2  \add I want you\add* to remember the words that were spoken by the holy prophets {that the holy prophets spoke} long ago,
and also to remember what our Lord and Savior commanded, things that we, your apostles, told you about.
\s 2 Peter 3:3-10 
\s Although certain people will ridicule the idea that the Lord Jesus Christ is going to come back, the reason why he has not
yet come back to judge people is that God is being patient with people; but Jesus will certainly come back and judge people.
\p
\v 3 It is important for you to understand that in the time \add immediately\add* before Christ comes back, there will be
people who will ridicule \add the idea of his coming back. Those people will do
whatever\add* evil deeds they wish to do. 
\v 4 They will say, “\add Although it was\add* promised \add that
Christ\add* will come back, ◄\add nothing has happened that would
indicate\add* that he is coming back./\add what happened to the promise\add* that he is coming back?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* We say that because
ever since the \add Christian\add* leaders \add who lived\add* long ago died \f + \fr euphemism \f*, everything
\add has remained the same\add*. Things are as \add they always have
been\add* since God created \add the world!\add*” 
\v 5  \add They will say that because\add* they ◄deliberately overlook
\add the fact/have decided to ignore what they know\add*► that God, by commanding
\add long ago that it should be so\add*, caused the heavens to exist, and he caused the earth to come up out of water and to be
separate from the water. 
\v 6 And God, by\add commanding that it should be so\add*, later destroyed the world
\add that existed\add* at that time, by causing the earth to be flooded with water {water to flood the earth}.
\v 7 Furthermore, \add God\add*, by commanding \add that it should be
so\add*, has set apart the heavens and the earth \add that exist\add* now, and they are being kept
{\add he\add* is keeping them} until the time when \add he\add* will judge ◄ungodly people/people whose lives are not pleasing
to him►. And at that time \add he\add* will destroy the heavens and the earth by burning them.
\v 8 Dear friends, I want you to understand well that the Lord \add God is willing to wait a long time to judge the people in
the world! How much time passes before\add* the Lord God \add judges the people in the world does not matter to him! He
considers\add* that one day \add passes no more quickly than\add* a thousand years, and
\add he also considers\add* that a thousand years \add pass as quickly
as\add* one day passes \add to us!\add* 
\v 9  \add Therefore, you should not think that because Christ has not yet come back to judge
people\add*, the Lord God is ◄delaying/slow to do► what he promised. Some people think that this is so,
\add and they say that Christ never will come back\add*. But \add you should understand that the reason why Christ has not yet
come back to judge people is that\add* God is being patient towards you, because he does not want anyone to be lost
\add eternally\add*. Instead, he wants everyone to turn away from their sinful behavior.
\v 10 Although \add God is being patient, at\add* the time \f + \fr metonymy \f*
\add that he has appointed\add*, the Lord \add Jesus Christ\add* will
\add certainly\add* come back \add to judge people\add*. He will come back
\add unexpectedly\add*, like a thief \f + \fr simile \f* \add comes unexpectedly\add*. At that time there will be a great roaring sound. The
heavens will cease to exist. ◄The elements/The parts \add of which the universe
consists\add*► will be destroyed by fire, and the earth \add that God
made\add* and everything on it \add that people have made\add* will disappear \f + \fr (OR, will be burned up) \f*.
\s 2 Peter 3:11-13 
\s You certainly ought to behave in a godly manner, because God will destroy everything and because only those people who are
righteous will live in the new heavens and on the new earth. 
\p
\v 11 Because God will certainly destroy all these things like \add I just
said\add*, ◄you certainly know how you should behave./do you know how you should behave?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* You should behave ◄in a
\add godly manner/\add*in a \add manner that pleases God\add*► 
\v 12 while you \add eagerly/expectantly\add* wait for\add Christ\add* to return on the day that God
\add has appointed/planned\add* \f + \fr metonymy \f*, and you should try to make that day come soon. Because of what
\add God\add* \f + \fr personification \f* \add will do on that day\add*, the heavens will be destroyed. ◄The elements/The parts of which the universe
consist► will melt and burn up. 
\v 13 Although \add all those events/things will happen, we rejoice
because\add* we are waiting for the new heavens and new earth that
\add God\add* has promised. The \add only people who will be\add* in the new heavens and on this new earth will be
\add people who are\add* \f + \fr personification \f* righteous. 
\s 2 Peter 3:14-18a 
\s Do all you can to conduct your lives in a godly manner. Guard against those who would entice you to doubt what you now
firmly believe. 
\p
\v 14 Therefore, dear friends, because you are waiting for these things
\add to happen\add*, do all that you can \add to conduct your lives\add* ◄in a
\add godly manner/\add*in a \add manner that pleases God\add*►, \add in order that
Christ\add* will see that you \add are\add* completely pure \f + \fr doublet \f*
\add and that you are living\add* peacefully \add with each other\add*.
\v 15 And think about this: Our Lord \add Jesus Christ is\add* patient
\add because he wants\add* people to be saved. Our dear ◄brother/fellow believer► Paul also wrote wise words to you
\add about these same matters\add*, because God enabled him to understand
\add these\add* ◄\add events/things that will happen\add*►. 
\v 16 In the \add letters\add* that Paul wrote there are certain things that are difficult for people to understand. People
\add who are spiritually\add* ignorant and ◄unstable/do not believe firmly in Christ► interpret these things wrongly, as they
also ◄interpret/explain the meaning of► the other parts of the Scriptures wrongly. The result is that they will destroy
themselves \add spiritually\add*, and \add God\add* will punish them.
\v 17 Therefore, dear friends, \add since you already know about these teachers of false
teachings\add*, ◄guard against them/beware►. Do not let these wicked people deceive you by telling you things that are wrong,
with the result that you yourselves begin to doubt \add what you now firmly
believe\add*. 
\v 18  \add Instead, live in such a manner that you\add* experience more and more our Savior Jesus Christ acting kindly
\add towards you\add*, and that you get to know him \add better and
better\add*. 
\s 2 Peter 3:18b 
\s I pray that Jesus Christ will always be honored. 
\p \add I pray/desire that Jesus Christ\add* will be honored both now and
forever!\f + Amen./So be it.” at the end.\f*
