\c 2  
\s 2 Peter 2:1-3 
\s There will be false teachers among you who will behave wickedly and who will entice you to behave just like they do. God
will certainly destroy them. 
\p
\v 1 Just like there were false prophets among the \add Israelite\add* people
\add long ago\add*, so there will also be teachers of false \add teachings\add* among you. They will enter
\add your congregations\add* without you realizing \add what/who they
are\add*, and they will \add spiritually\add* injure some people by what they teach. Specifically, these teachers will even
deny \add that\add* the Lord \add Jesus died to\add* pay\add for the guilt of our
sins\add*. As a result, they will soon destroy themselves \add spiritually, and God will also punish
them\add*. 
\v 2 And many \add people\add* will behave in an extremely immoral manner, imitating the extremely immoral manner in which
\add these teachers of false teaching\add* behave. As a result, \add unbelievers\add* will ◄discredit the true message/say the
true message is false►. 
\v 3 Because \add the teachers of false teaching\add* want a lot of things that other people have,
\add they think that\add* by telling you stories that they themselves have ◄made up/invented►, they will get money from you.
\add God decided\add* long ago \add that he would\add* punish them, and he has not fallen asleep \f + \fr litotes \f*!
\add He will certainly destroy them\add*! 
\s 2 Peter 2:4-10c 
\s It is certain that God knows how to rescue those who are godly, and that he knows how to keep those who are unrighteous
until the time when he will punish them. 
\p
\v 4 God destroyed \f + \fr litotes \f* the angels who sinned. He threw them into the worst place in hell and imprisoned
them\add there\add* in darkness in order to keep them there until he judges
\add and punishes them\add*. 
\v 5 He also got rid of \f + \fr litotes \f* \add the people who lived in\add* \f + \fr metonymy \f* the world long ago. He saved
\add only\add* eight of them, including Noah, who was a righteous preacher. God saved them when he destroyed by a flood
\add all\add* ◄the ungodly people/the people whose lives were not pleasing to him►
\add who were living then\add*. 
\v 6 He also condemned Sodom and Gomorrah \add cities\add*; that is, he destroyed them by burning them completely to ashes.
\add By doing that\add* he gave a warning to those who afterwards would live in ◄an ungodly manner/a manner that is displeasing
to him►. 
\v 7 But he rescued \add Abraham's nephew\add*, Lot, who was a righteous
\add man. Lot\add* was ◄greatly distressed/very sad► because the people
\add in Sodom\add* were doing very immoral deeds. 
\v 8 That righteous \add man's\add* soul ◄was tormented/suffered great agony► day after day because he saw and heard those
wicked people behave in a very lawless/wicked \add manner when he
was\add* living among them. 
\v 9 And since the Lord God \add rescued Lot, you can be sure that\add* he knows how to rescue ◄godly people/people whose lives
please him► from their sufferings, and \add he is able\add* to keep ◄ungodly
\add people/people whose lives do not please him\add*►, \add whom he has started
to\add* punish even now, until the time when he will \add finish judging them and
punish\add* them. 
\v 10  \add He will punish especially severely\add* those \add ungodly teachers of false
teachings\add* who do the things that their self-directed nature desires, things that ◄defile them/cause them to be impure in
every way►. Those \add teachers of false teachings\add* despise \add all beings
who\add* rule \add over them\add*. 
\s 2 Peter 2:10d-16 
\s Because those teachers of false doctrine will behave wickedly and will entice people to do the same things that they do, God
will destroy them. 
\p Because \add those teachers of false teachings are\add* extremely arrogant/proud \f + \fr doublet \f*, they ◄are not afraid to
insult/boldly speak evil about► glorious beings \add in heaven\add* (OR, glorious/wonderful beings
\add who rule over people\add*). 
\v 11 In contrast, angels do not insult \add those teachers\add* when those teachers accuse the angels while the Lord God is
watching, even though the angels are much more powerful \f + \fr doublet \f* \add than the teachers of false
teaching\add*. 
\v 12 Because those \add teachers of false doctrines are\add* like animals that cannot think
\add as humans do\add* \f + \fr doublet \f*, they say evil things about \add spiritual\add* things concerning which they know nothing.
\add As a result\add*, God will destroy them like \add people\add* destroy
\add animals\add*, \add animals\add* that are born only in order to be captured and destroyed {in order that
\add people\add* should capture and destroy them}. 
\v 13 God will punish \add those teachers\add* in return for the unrighteous actions/things that they have done. It even
pleases them ◄to carouse/to drink and revel noisily► in the daytime
\add as well as at night\add*. And as they indulge/enjoy themselves just like they want to while they are feasting with you,
they ◄\add defile you greatly/cause you to become impure\add*►, \add as\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f* stains and blotches \f + \fr doublet \f*
\add defile a clean garment\add*. 
\v 14 They \add want to commit\add* \f + \fr metonymy \f* adultery \add with every
woman\add* whom they look at. They never stop seeking opportunities to sin. They entice/persuade those who are
\add spiritually\add* unstable \add to join them in doing the sinful things that they
do\add*. \add Because of\add* their ever-increasing ◄greed/desire to have more and more things►, they are doomed
\add to eternal punishment\add*. 
\v 15 They have ◄rejected good moral standards/quit doing what everyone knows is right►. They have imitated
\add what the prophet\add* Balaam, the son of Bosor, \add did long
ago\add*. He, \add acting very\add* unrighteously, wanted \add the enemies of the
Jews\add* to pay him if he \add asked God\add* ◄\add to curse/to do bad thing
to\add*► \add the Jews\add*. 
\v 16 But God rebuked him for having done that which was wrong\add and
for\add* behaving very foolishly. And even though donkeys do not speak,
\add God used\add* a donkey to hinder Balaam \add by enabling it
to\add* speak to him with a human voice. 
\s 2 Peter 2:17-22 
\s Because those teachers of false doctrine will entice people to behave wickedly, God has reserved darkest hell for them.
\p
\v 17 These \add teachers of false teachings mislead/deceive people by promising what they cannot
do\add*, as \f + \fr metaphor \f* dried-up springs \add mislead/deceive people by causing them to expect to get water from
them\add*. They \add mislead/deceive people\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f* just like clouds that are blown along by strong winds
\add mislead/deceive people by causing them to expect rain, but no rain falls.
Therefore\add*, God has reserved the darkness of hell \add for those teachers of false
teachings\add*. 
\v 18 By boasting proudly as they make speeches that are worthless, they entice people who have recently
\add become believers and\add* have ceased to do the things that wicked people do. They entice them
\add into sin\add* by encouraging them to \add do the\add* evil deeds that their self-directed nature
\add urges them to do\add*. 
\v 19  \add The false teachers\add* tell people that they are free
\add to do whatever they want to do, even though\add* they themselves are
\add like\add* slaves \f + \fr metaphor \f* \add because their own self-directed nature forces them to
do\add* sinful deeds\add . Think about these well-known words: ‘Whenever a person is controlled by
something\add* {\add something controls a person\add*}, \add it is as
though\add* that person has become a slave of what controls him.’
\v 20 Those \add teachers of false teachings\add* learned about our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. As a result, they stopped
doing those deeds that ◄defile \add people/cause people to become
impure\add*► \add spiritually\add*. Since they have begun to do \add those evil deeds
again\add*, with the result that they are unable to stop doing such deeds, they are in a worse condition than
\add they were in before they knew Jesus Christ\add*. 
\v 21  \add Because God will severely punish them\add*, it would have been better for them if they had never known what it
means to conduct their lives in a righteous manner. It is too bad that although they knew
\add how to conduct their lives in a righteous manner\add*, they rejected the things that God commanded people to do, the
things that \add were\add* taught to them ◄\add by us apostles/by
Christ\add*► {that ◄\add we apostles/Christ\add*► taught to them}.
\v 22  \add The way in which they are behaving again\add* is just like ◄the proverbs/what people often say►:
\add They are like\add* dogs that return to \add eat\add* their vomit, and
\add they are like\add* pigs that have washed and then roll \add again\add* in the mud.
