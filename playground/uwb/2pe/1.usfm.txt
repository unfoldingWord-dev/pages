\v 1 I, Simon Peter, \add am writing this letter to you. I\add* serve Jesus Christ, and am an apostle
\add appointed by\add* him. \add I am sending this letter to you\add* whom God has caused to believe
\add in Christ\add* just like he \add caused us(exc) apostles to believe in
Christ\add*. You and we have ◄equally been given the\f + \ft Or: both \f* been given the same► privilege of believing in Jesus Christ.
He\add is\add* God, he is righteous, he is the one whom we \add worship\add*, and he is our Savior.
\v 2  \add I pray that God\add* will continue to act very kindly towards you, and give you ◄a deep\f + \ft Or: very \f* much►
\add inner\add* peace, because you \add truly\add* know God and Jesus, who is our Lord.
\s 2 Peter 1:3-4 
\s God has given us everything that we need to receive eternal life and to live godly lives.
\p
\v 3  \add God\add* \\f + \\ft personification \\f* has given us everything \add that we need\add* in order that we might receive
\add eternal\add* life and in order that we might \add conduct our
lives\add* ◄in a godly way\f + \ft Or: in \f* a way that pleases him►. He gives us that by the power that he has because he is God, and he has
also given it to us as a result of our knowing him. He is the one who by his own glorious\f + \ft Or: wonderful \f* and perfect
\add nature\add* chose us \add to be his people\add*. 
\v 4 By means of this \add glorious and perfect nature\add*, he has promised us
\add that he will do\add* very great and ◄priceless\f + \ft Or: very \f* precious► things
\add for us\add*. \add He has also promised\add* to you that by \add believing what he has
promised\add* you will be able to act \add righteously\add*, just like God acts
\add righteously\add*, and that you will be free from being morally depraved\f + \ft Or: corrupted \f*, and that you will not be
\add like\add* those who do not believe in Christ and are morally depraved because of their desire to do what is evil.
\s 2 Peter 1:5-11 
\s Exert yourselves to the utmost to develop a stable Christian character.
\p
\v 5 Because God has done all that, ◄by exerting yourselves strenuously\f + \ft Or: by \f* trying very hard►, make sure that you not only
believe \add in Christ\add*, but that you are also living morally good lives. And make sure that you are not only living
morally good lives, but that you also know \add what God desires\add* \f + \ft (OR, behave wisely).
\v 6 And make sure that you not only know \add what God desires\add* (OR, behave wisely) but that you also control what you say
and do. And make sure that you not only control what you say and do, but that you are also steadfast. And make sure that you
are not only ◄steadfast\f + \ft Or: patient \f* when you suffer►, but that you are also godly.
\v 7 And make sure that you not only ◄are godly\f + \ft Or: conduct \f* your lives in a way that pleases God►, but that you also have a concern
for your fellow believers, as brothers and sisters \add ought to
have\add* for each other. And make sure that you not only have a concern for your fellow believers, but that you also love
\add others\add*. 
\v 8 If you do these \add things\add*, and if \add you do them\add* more and more, that demonstrates that knowing our Lord
Jesus Christ ◄is very effective\f + \ft Or: produces \f* good results► \\f + \\ft litotes \\f* in your lives.
\v 9 If these \add qualities\add* are not present in people, it means they are not aware
\add that these things are important, just like a blind person is not aware of what is around
him\add*. They \add think only about earthly matters, just like\add* \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* a shortsighted person
\add sees clearly only things that are near\add*. It seems that they have forgotten that God has forgiven them for their former
sinful lives. 
\v 10 Instead of \add acting like those people\add*, try to confirm\f + \ft Or: prove \f* by the way you conduct your lives that you are among
those whom \add God\add* has chosen \\f + \\ft doublet \\f* to be his people. If you do that, you will certainly never become separated from God,
\v 11 and \add God\add* will very wholeheartedly welcome you into the place where our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will rule
\add his people\add* forever. 
\s 2 Peter 1:12-15 
\s I intend to keep reminding you very frequently about these matters.
\p
\v 12 I intend to keep on reminding you very frequently \\f + \\ft hyperbole \\f* about these
\add matters\add*, even though you \add already\add* know them and are firmly convinced that they are true.
\v 13 I consider it right that I should help you \add to continually think about these
matters\add* by reminding you \add about them\add* as long as I am alive \\f + \\ft euphemism \\f*,
\v 14 because I know that I shall die \\f + \\ft euphemism \\f* soon, just like our Lord Jesus Christ clearly has revealed to me.
\v 15 Moreover, I will ◄make every effort\f + \ft Or: try \f* hard► \add by writing these things
down\add* to enable you to remember them at all times after I have died \\f + \\ft euphemism \\f*.
\s 2 Peter 1:16-21 
\s You can be sure that these matters are true, because we apostles ourselves witnessed that our Lord Jesus Christ is supremely
great, and also because what the prophets say about him is completely reliable.
\p
\v 16 We \add apostles\add* told you that our Lord Jesus Christ \add acts\add* powerfully and that he is coming back
\add some day\add*. We were not basing \add what we told you\add* on stories that we had cleverly ◄invented\f + \ft Or: made \f* up►. Instead,
we told you what we ourselves saw with our own eyes, that \add the\add* Lord Jesus is supremely great.
\v 17 God, our Father, greatly honored him when God's great glory\f + \ft Or: brightness \f* surrounded him, and God \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* said, “This is my
Son, whom I love very much; I am very pleased with him.” 
\v 18 We\add (exc)\add* ourselves heard \add God\add* \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* \add say\add* that from heaven, when we were with
\add Christ\add* on that holy\f + \ft Or: sacred \f* mountain. 
\v 19 We also have what the prophets \add wrote about Christ long
ago\add*, which is completely reliable\f + \ft Or: trustworthy \f*. You should ◄pay attention to\f + \ft Or: think \f* carefully about►
\add what they wrote\add*, because \add what they wrote enables you to know whether what is taught to you is true or whether it
is false\add* \\f + \\ft simile \\f*, like a lamp that is shining in a dark place
\add enables people to see where they are going\add* \\f + \\ft simile \\f*. \add You
should\add* ◄\add pay attention to\f + \ft Or: think \f* carefully about\add*► \add what they
wrote\add* until \add our Lord Jesus Christ comes back and enables\add* you \\f + \\ft synecdoche \\f*
\add to know God fully, which will be like when\add* \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* ◄a day dawns\f + \ft Or: daylight \f* comes► and the morning star rises
\add and we can see it clearly\add*. 
\v 20 It is important that you realize that no one can interpret\f + \ft Or: explain \f* by himself
\add the meaning of\add* what the prophets wrote \add in the Scriptures\add* without
\add the help of God's Spirit\add* (OR, no \add part of the\add* Scriptures originated with the prophet himself) \f*,
\v 21 because no human beings decided \add to make those prophecies\add*. On the contrary, those who spoke
\add messages from God\add* did that because it was the Holy Spirit who caused them to do
\add it, and therefore the Spirit must help us to interpret\f + \ft Or: understand \f* their
meaning\add*.
