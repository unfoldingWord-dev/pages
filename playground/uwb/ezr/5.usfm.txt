\s Tattenai's letter to King Darius 
\p
\v 1 At that time two prophets gave messages from God to the Jews in Jerusalem and
\add other cities in\add* Judah. The prophets were Haggai and Zechariah, who was a descendant of Iddo. They spoke those
messages representing God, whom the Israelis \add worshiped\f + \ft Or: belonged \f*
to\add*, the one who was their true king. 
\v 2 Then Zerubbabel and Shealtiel \add led many other people\add* as they started
\add again to rebuild the temple of God in Jerusalem. And God's prophets Haggai and
Zechariah\add* were with them and helped them. 
\p
\v 3 Then Tattenai the governor of the province west of the \add Euphrates\add* River and Shethar-Bozenai his assistant and
\add some of\add* their officials went to Jerusalem and said to the people, "Who has permitted you to rebuild this temple and
put furnishings in it?" 
\v 4 They also requested the people to tell them the names of the men who were working
\add at the temple\add*. \add But the people refused\add*. 
\v 5 However, God was taking care of the Jewish leaders, so their enemies were not able to prevent
\add the people from continuing to rebuild the temple\add*. \add They continued to work while their
enemies\add* sent a report to King Darius, and asked him \add what he wanted them to do about
it\add*. 
\p
\v 6 So Tattenai and Shethar-Bozenai and their officials sent a report to King Darius.
\v 7 This is what they wrote: 
\b
\q "King Darius, we hope that things are going well for you! 
\pi
\v 8  \add We want you to know that\add* we went to Judah Province, where the temple of the great God is being rebuilt. The
people are building it with huge stones, and they are putting wooden beams in the walls. The work is being done very carefully,
and they are progressing well. 
\pi
\v 9 We asked the Jewish leaders, 'Who has permitted you to rebuild this temple and put furnishings in it?'
\v 10 And we requested them to tell us the names of their leaders, in order that we could tell you who they were.
\pi
\v 11 But \add instead of telling us their leaders' names\add*, what they said was, 'We serve the God
\add who created\add* the heaven and the earth. Many years ago a great king of us Israeli people
\add told our ancestors to\add* build a temple here, and now we are rebuilding it.
\b
\pi
\v 12 But God, \add who rules in\add* heaven, allowed \add the armies
of\add* Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylonia, to destroy that temple, because our ancestors did things that caused God to become
very angry. Nebuchadnezzar's army took \add many of the Israeli\add* people to Babylonia.
\pi
\v 13 However, during the first year that Cyrus the King of Babylon started to rule, he decreed that the temple of God should
be rebuilt. 
\v 14 Cyrus returned \add to the Jewish leaders\add* all the gold and silver cups that had been taken from the temple in
Jerusalem and which had been put in the temple in Babylon. Those cups were given to a man named Sheshbazzar, whom King Cyrus
had appointed to be the governor in Judah. 
\pi
\v 15 The king instructed him to take the cups back to Jerusalem, to the place
\add from which they had previously been taken\add*. He also decreed that they should rebuild the temple at the place where it
had been before. So Cyrus appointed Sheshbazzar to be the governor in Judah. He also sent all those things made of gold and
silver, for Sheshbazzar to put in the new temple. 
\v 16 So Sheshbazzar did that. He came here to Jerusalem, and \add supervised the men
who\add* laid the foundation of the temple. And since that time, the people have been working on the temple, but it is not
finished yet.' 
\b
\pi
\v 17 Therefore, your majesty, please order someone to search in the place in Babylon where the important records are kept, to
find out whether \add it is true that\add* King Cyrus decreed that God's temple should be rebuilt in Jerusalem. Then you can
tell us what you want us to do about this matter."
