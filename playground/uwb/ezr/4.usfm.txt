\s Their enemies opposed rebuilding the temple 
\p
\v 1 The enemies of the people of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin heard that the
\add Israeli\add* people who had returned from Babylonia were rebuilding a temple for Yahweh, the God whom the Israeli people
\add worshiped\add*. 
\v 2 So they went to Zerubbabel \add the governor\add* and the other leaders, and said
\add deceptively\add*, "We want to help \add you build the temple\add*, because we worship that same God whom you worship, and
we have been offering sacrifices to him since Esarhaddon, the king of Assyria, brought us here."
\p
\v 3 But Zerubbabel, Jeshua, and the other \add Israeli\add* leaders replied, "We will not allow you to help us build a temple
for our\f + \ft exclusive \f* God. We will build it ourselves\f + \ft Or: without your help \f* for Yahweh, the God whom we Israelis worship, like Cyrus, the
king of Persia, told us to do." 
\p
\v 4 Then the people who had been living in that land \add before the Israelis
returned\add* tried to cause the Jews to become discouraged and become afraid, and to cause them to stop building the temple.
\v 5 They bribed government officials to oppose what the Israelis were doing
\add and prevent them from continuing to work on the temple\add*. They did that all during the time that Cyrus was king of
Persia. They continued to do it when Darius became the king of Persia.
\s Opposition to rebuilding Jerusalem 
\p
\v 6 During the first year that \add Darius' son\add* Xerxes was king, the
\add enemies of the Jews\add* wrote a note \add to the king\add* saying
\add that the Jews were planning to rebel against the government\add*.
\p
\v 7 Later, when \add Xerxes' son\add* Artaxerxes \add became king of
Persia\add*, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel and their colleagues\f + \ft Or: companions \f* wrote a letter to him. They wrote the letter in the
Aramaic language, and it was translated \add into another language that the king
knew\add*. 
\p
\v 8 Rehum, the high commissioner, and Shimshai, the provincial secretary, wrote the letter to King Artaxerxes concerning what
was happening in Jerusalem. 
\mi
\v 9 They stated that the letter was from Rehum the high commissioner\f + \ft Or: governor \f* and Shimshai the provincial secretary and from
their associates, the judges, and other government officials, who were from Erech
\add city\add*, Babylon \add city\add*, and Susa \add city\add* in Elam
\add district\add*. 
\v 10  \add They also wrote that they represented\add* the other people-groups whom
\add the army of\add* the great and glorious\f + \ft Or: famous \f* \add King\add* Ashurbanipal had deported\f + \ft Or: forced to move from their homes \f*
and taken to live in Samaria city and in other cities in the province west of the Euphrates
\add River\add*. 
\b
\p
\v 11 This is what they wrote in the letter: 
\b
\mi To King Artaxerxes 
\b
\mi From the officials who serve you who live in the province west of the Euphrates
\add River\add* 
\b
\pi
\v 12 "Your majesty, we want you to know that the Jews who came here from your territories are rebuilding this city,
\add Jerusalem\add*. These people are wicked and want to rebel against you. Now they are repairing the foundations
\add of the walls\f + \ft Or: buldings \f*\add* and building the walls \add of the
city\add*. 
\pi
\v 13 It is important for you to know that if they rebuild the city and finish building the walls, they will stop paying any
kind of taxes. As a result, there will be less money in your treasury.
\v 14 Now, because we are loyal to [IDI] you, and because we do not want you to be humiliated [IDI], we are sending this
information to you. 
\v 15 And, we suggest that you order\f + \ft Or: tell \f* \add your officials\add* to search the records that your ancestors made\f + \ft Or: wrote \f*. If you
do that, you will find out that the people in this city have always rebelled
\add against the government\add*. You will also find out that from long ago these people have caused trouble for kings and for
rulers of provinces. They have always revolted against \add those who ruled
them\add*. That is the reason that this city was destroyed \add by the Babylonian
army\add*. 
\v 16 We want you to know that if they rebuild this city and finish building its walls, you will no longer be able to
control\f + \ft Or: rule \f* \add the people in\add* this province west of the Euphrates
\add River\add*." 
\p
\v 17 After the king \add read this letter\add*, he sent this reply to them:
\b
\pi "To Rehum, the high commissioner, and Shimshai, the provincial secretary, and their colleagues in Samaria and in other
parts of the province that is west of the \add Euphrates\add* River: I send you my greetings\f + \ft Or: wish that things will go well for
you \f*. 
\v 18 The letter that you sent to me was translated and read to me.
\v 19 So then I ordered \add my officials\add* to search the records. I have found out that
\add it is true that\add* the people of that city have always revolted against their rulers, and that the city is full of
people who have rebelled and caused trouble. 
\v 20 Powerful kings have ruled in Jerusalem, and they have also ruled over the whole province west of the
\add Euphrates\add* River. \add The people in that province were\add* paying all kinds of taxes to those kings.
\v 21 So you must command that the people must stop rebuilding the city. Only if I tell them
\add that they may rebuild it\add* will they be allowed to continue.
\v 22 Do this immediately \f + \ft litotes \f*, because I do not want those people to do anything to harm the things\f + \ft Or: area \f* about which I am
concerned." 
\p
\v 23  \add Messengers took\add* that letter to Rehum and Shimshai and their colleagues and read it to them. Then Rehum and the
others went quickly to Jerusalem, and they forced the Jews to stop rebuilding the city wall.
\p
\v 24 The result was that the Jews stopped rebuilding the temple. They did not do any more work to rebuild the temple until
Darius became the king of Persia.
