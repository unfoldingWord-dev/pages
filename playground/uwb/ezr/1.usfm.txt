\s Cyrus let the Jews return to Jerusalem 
\p
\v 1 During the first year that Cyrus ruled the Persian \add Empire\add*, he did something that fulfilled the prophecy that
Jeremiah had made. Yahweh motivated Cyrus to write this message, and then Cyrus caused this message to be proclaimed throughout
his empire: 
\pi
\v 2 "I, King Cyrus, who rule the Persian \add Empire\add*, declare this: Yahweh, the God who
\add is\f + \ft Or: rules \f*\add* in heaven, has caused me to become the ruler of all the kingdoms
\add that I know about\add* on the earth. And he has appointed me to
\add enable his people\add* to build a temple for him in Jerusalem, in Judah
\add land\add*. 
\v 3 All you people who belong to God may go up to Jerusalem to rebuild this temple for Yahweh, the God who lives in Jerusalem,
the God \add who is worshiped by you Israeli\add* people. I desire\f + \ft Or: hope \f* that your God will be with you
\add and help those who go\add*. 
\v 4 Those people who are in places where Israelis are living, whose ancestors were exiled here, should contribute silver and
gold to those who go. They should also give them supplies \add that they will need for the journey to
Jerusalem\add*. They should also give them some livestock, and gifts of money to help build the temple of God in Jerusalem."
\p
\v 5 Then God motivated some of the priests and Levites\f + \ft Or: men who did work in the temple \f* and some of the leaders of the tribes
that were descended from Judah and Benjamin to return to Jerusalem. Those whom God motivated got ready to return to Jerusalem
and build the temple for Yahweh there. 
\v 6 All of their neighbors helped them by giving them things made of silver and things made of gold, and supplies for the
journey, and livestock. They also gave them other valuable gifts, and also gave them money
\add to buy things for building the temple\add*. 
\v 7 King Cyrus brought out the valuable things that King Nebuchadnezzar's
\add soldiers\add* had taken from the temple of Yahweh in Jerusalem and put in the temple of Nebuchadnezzar's gods
\add in Babylon\add*. 
\v 8 Cyrus commanded Mithredath, the treasurer of the Persian \add Empire\add*, to count all these items and then give them to
Sheshbazzar, the leader of \add the group that was going to return
to\add* Judah. 
\p
\v 9 This is a list of the items that Cyrus donated: 
\pi 30 large gold dishes 
\pi 1,000 large silver dishes 
\pi 29 silver censers\f + \ft Or: pans \f* 
\pi
\v 10 30 gold bowls 
\pi 410 silver bowls 
\pi 1,000 other items 
\p
\v 11 All together, there were 5,400 items made of silver or gold,
\add that were given to\add* Sheshbazzar to take with him when he and the others returned to Jerusalem.
