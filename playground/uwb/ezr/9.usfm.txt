\c 9  
\s Ezra prayed about their marrying foreign wives 
\p
\v 1 Some time later, the Jewish leaders came to me and said, “Many Israelis, and even some priests and other men who are
descendants of Levi \add who work in the temple\add*, have not kept themselves from
\add doing what\add* the other people who are living in this land
\add do\add*. They are practicing the detestable things that the Canaan, Heth, Periz, Jebus, Ammon, and Amor people-groups, and
the people from Moab and Egypt do. 
\v 2  \add Specifically, some\add* Israeli men have married women who are not Israelis, and they have allowed their sons to do
the same thing. So we, God's sacred people, have become ◄contaminated/impure in God's sight►. And some of our leaders and
officials have been the first/worst ones to do this.” 
\p
\v 3 When I heard that, I \add became very angry, with the result
that\add* I tore my clothes and tore some hair from my head and from my beard. Then I sat down, very shocked/dismayed.
\add The Israelis knew that God had warned us that he would punish us if we
disobeyed\add* what he had said to us \add about marrying women who are not
Israelis\add*. 
\v 4 So many of them trembled/were afraid when they heard that some of those who had returned from Babylonia had sinned like
that. They came and sat with me until it was time to offer the evening sacrifices
\add of grain\add*. 
\p
\v 5 When it was time to offer those sacrifices, I was still sitting there, wearing those torn clothes and mourning/sad. I
stood up, and then I quickly prostrated myself on the ground. I lifted up my hands to Yahweh, my God,
\v 6 and this is what I prayed: 
\pi “Yahweh my God, I am very ashamed to raise my head in front of you. The sins that we Israelis have committed
\add are very great; it is as though they\add* have risen up higher than our heads, and our guilt
\add for committing those sins, it is as though it\add* rises up to the heavens.
\v 7 Since the time that our ancestors lived until now, we have been very guilty. That is the reason that we and our kings and
our priests have been defeated by the \add armies of\add* the kings of other lands. They killed some of our people, they
captured some, they robbed some, and they \add caused them all to
be\add* disgraced, just like we are today. 
\pi
\v 8 But now, Yahweh God, you have acted very kindly toward us. You have allowed some of us to ◄survive/continue to live►. You
have revived our spirits [IDI] and allowed us to escape from being slaves
\add in Babylonia\add* and to return safely [IDI] to live in this sacred place.
\v 9 We were slaves, but you did not abandon us. Instead, because you faithfully love us, you caused the kings of Persia to act
very kindly toward us. You have allowed us to continue to live and to rebuild your temple which had been completely destroyed.
You have allowed us to start to live safely here in Jerusalem and in
\add other towns in\add* Judah. 
\pi
\v 10 Our God, what more can we say now [RHQ]? In spite of \add all that you have done for
us\add*, we have disobeyed your commands. 
\v 11 They are commands that you gave to your servants, the prophets, to tell to us. They said that the land that we would
occupy was polluted because of the detestable/disgusting things that were done by the people who lived there. They said that
the land was filled from one end to the other with people who did immoral/shameful things.
\v 12 They said, ‘Do not allow your daughters to marry their sons! Do not allow your sons to marry their daughters! Do not even
try to cause things to go well for those people-groups! If you obey these instructions, your nation will be strong, and you
will enjoy the good crops that grow on the land, and the land will belong to your descendants forever.’
\pi
\v 13 You punished us because we were very guilty for having done wicked things. But you have not punished us as much as we
deserve to be punished. \add I say this because\add* you, our God, have allowed some of us to survive.
\v 14 However, some of us are again disobeying your commands, and we are marrying women who do those detestable things. If we
continue to do that, surely you will get rid of all of us [RHQ], with the result that none of us will remain alive.
\v 15 Yahweh, the God whom we Israelis \add worship/belong to\add*, you are fair/just. We are guilty. We are only a few people
who have escaped \add from Babylonia\add*, but we pray to you, even though and we do not deserve to stand in your presence.”
