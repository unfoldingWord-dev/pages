\s They rebuilt the altar in Jerusalem 
\p
\v 1  \add After the Israeli people returned to Jerusalem\add*, and they began to live in their towns, ◄in the autumn of\f + \ft Or: after \f*
the hot season ended in► that year, they all gathered together in Jerusalem.
\v 2 Then Jeshua, the son of Jehozadak, and his fellow priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and his friends, all began
to rebuild the altar of God, the one whom the Israeli people \add worshiped\add*. They did that in order that they could
sacrifice burned offerings on it, according to what the prophet Moses had written in the laws
\add that God gave to him\add*. 
\v 3-6 Even though they were afraid of the people who were already living in that area, they rebuilt the altar at the same
place \add where the previous altar had been\add*. Before they started to lay the foundation of Yahweh's temple,
\add the priests\add* started to burn sacrifices to Yahweh \add on the
altar\add*. They offered sacrifices every morning and every evening. Fifteen days after
\add they started to offer these sacrifices\add*, the people celebrated the Festival of Shelters, as
\add Moses\add* had commanded them to do in the laws \add that God gave to
him\add*. Each day the priests offered the sacrifices that were required for that day. In addition, they presented the regular
burned offerings and the offerings that were required for the New Moon Festivals and the other festivals that they celebrated
each year \add to honor\add* Yahweh. They also brought other offerings only because they desired to bring them,
\add not because they were required to bring them\add*. 
\s They rebuilt the temple 
\p
\v 7 Then the Israelis hired masons and carpenters, and they bought
\add logs from\add* cedar trees from the people of Tyre and Sidon
\add cities\add*, and they gave those people food and wine and olive oil for the logs. They brought the logs down from
\add the mountains in\add* Lebanon \add to the Mediterranean seacoast and then floated them along the coast of the
Sea\add*, to Joppa. King Cyrus permitted them to do that. Then the logs were brought from Joppa inland up to Jerusalem.
\p
\v 8 The Israelis started to rebuild the temple in the ◄Spring\f + \ft Or: time \f* before the hot season► of the second year after they
returned to Jerusalem. Zerubbabel and Jeshua and all the people who had returned to Jerusalem worked on the building. All the
◄Levites\f + \ft Or: men \f* who did work in the temple► supervised this work. 
\v 9 Jeshua and his sons and his other relatives, and Kadmiel and his sons, who were descendants of Hodaviah, also helped to
supervise the work. The family of Henadad, who were also all Levites, joined with them in supervising this work.
\p
\v 10 When the builders finished laying the foundation of the temple, the priests put on their robes and stood in their places,
blowing their trumpets. Then the Levites, who were descendants of Asaph, clashed\f + \ft Or: banged \f* their cymbals to praise Yahweh, just as
King David had \add many years previously\add* told \add Asaph and the other
musicians\add* to do. 
\v 11 They praised Yahweh and thanked him, and they sang this song about him:
\q He is very good \add to us\add*! 
\q He faithfully loves us Israeli people, and he will love us forever.
\m Then all the people shouted loudly, praising Yahweh because they had finished laying the foundation of Yahweh's temple.
\v 12 Many of the \add old\add* priests, Levites, and leaders of families remembered what the first temple
\add was like\add*, and they cried aloud when they saw the foundation of this temple being laid
\add because they knew that the new temple would not be as beautiful as the first
temple\add*. But the other people shouted joyfully. 
\v 13 The shouting and the crying was very loud; even people far away could hear it.
