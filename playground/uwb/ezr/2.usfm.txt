\v 57 Shephatiah, Hattil, Pokereth-Hazzebaim, and Ami. 
\b
\p
\v 58 Altogether, there were 392 temple workers and descendants of Solomon's servants who returned.
\b
\pi
\v 59 There was another group who returned \add to Judah\add* from Tel-Melah, Tel-Harsha, Kerub, Addan, and Immer
\add towns in Babylonia\add*. But they could not prove that they were descendants of
\add people who previously lived in\add* Israel. 
\b
\p
\v 60 This group included 652 people who were descendants of Delaiah, Tobiah, and Nekoda.
\p
\v 61 Hobaiah's clan, Hakkoz's clan, and Barzillai's clan also returned. Barzillai had married a woman who was a descendant of
Barzillai from the Gilead \add region\add*, and he had taken for himself the name of his father-in-law's clan.
\p
\v 62 The people in that group searched in the documents that had the names of the ancestors of all the clans, but these men's
names were not found. So they were not permitted do the work that priests did.
\v 63 The governor told them that they would need to ask a priest to consult Yahweh by ◄casting the sacred lots\f + \ft Or: throwing \f* the
sacred stones that had been marked►, to determine if those men were truly Israelis. When the priests did that,
\add if the stones showed that those men were Israelis\add*, they would be permitted to eat the shares of the sacrifices that
were given to the priests. 
\b
\pi
\v 64 Altogether 42,360 Israeli people who returned to Judah. 
\v 65 There were also 7,337 servants and 200 musicians, both men and women, who returned.
\v 66 The Israelis brought with them \add from Babylonia\add* 736 horses, 245 mules,
\v 67 435 camels, and 6,720 donkeys. 
\p
\v 68 When they arrived at the temple of Yahweh in Jerusalem, some of the clan leaders gave money for
\add the supplies needed to\add* rebuild the temple at the place where the temple had been previously.
\v 69 They all gave as much money as they were able to give. Altogether they gave 61,000 gold coins, ◄6,250 pounds\f + \ft Or: 3 \f*,000 kg.►
of silver, and 100 robes for the priests. 
\p
\v 70 Then the priests, the descendants of Levi, the musicians, the temple guards, and some of the other people started to live
in the towns and villages \add near Jerusalem\add*. The rest of the people went to the other places in Israel there where their
ancestors had lived.
