\s What King Darius commanded 
\p
\v 1  \add Later\add* Darius \add became the ruler of the Persian Empire. When the enemies of the Israelis forced them to stop
rebuilding the temple, the Persian officials sent a message to King Darius. They asked
him\add* to search the records in the archives\f + \ft Or: government records \f*, in the building where the king stored the important
documents, \add to find out whether King Cyrus had authorized that the temple should be
rebuilt\add*. 
\v 2  \add The king commanded someone to search there, but those documents were not there in
Babylon\add*. They found a scroll at the fort in Ecbatana, in Media province,
\add that contained the information that they wanted to know\add*.
\p This is what was written on that scroll: 
\pi
\v 3 During the first year that Cyrus \add ruled the empire\add*, he sent out a decree concerning the temple of God which is at
Jerusalem. In the decree it was stated that a new temple must be built at the same place that
\add the Israeli people previously\add* had offered sacrifices, where the
\add original\add* foundation \add of the first temple\add* was. The temple must be ninety feet high and ninety feet wide.
\v 4 The building must be made from large stones. After putting down three layers of stones, a layer of timber must be put on
top of them. This work will be paid for by money from my treasury.
\v 5 Also, the gold and silver utensils that King Nebuchadnezzar took from the temple of God in Jerusalem and brought to
Babylon must be taken back to Jerusalem. They must be put in God's temple just as they were in the previous temple.
\b
\p
\v 6 After reading this, King Darius sent this message \add to the leaders of the Israeli people's enemies in
Jerusalem:\add* 
\pi This is a message for Tattenai, the governor of the province west of the
\add Euphrates\add* River, and for \add his assistant\add* Shethar-Bozenai, and for all your colleagues: stay away from that
area! 
\v 7 Do not interfere with\f + \ft Or: hinder \f* the work of building the temple of God! The temple must be rebuilt at the same place where
the former temple was. And do not hinder the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews
\add while they are doing this work\add*. 
\pi
\v 8 Furthermore, I declare that you must help these leaders of the Jews as they rebuild this temple of God
\add by giving them funds for the building work\add*. 
\pi
\v 9 The Jewish priests in Jerusalem need young bulls and rams and lambs to sacrifice as they make burned offerings to the God
of heaven. You must give them the animals that they need. Also, you must be certain to give them the wheat, salt, wine, and
\add olive\add* oil that they need each day \add for those sacrifices\add*.
\v 10 If you do that, they will be able to offer sacrifices that please the God who is in heaven, and they will pray that God
will bless me and my sons. 
\pi
\v 11 If anyone disobeys this decree, \add my soldiers\add* will pull a beam from his house. Then
\add after they sharpen one end of the beam\add*, they will lift that man up and impale him on that beam. Then they will
\add completely destroy that man's house until only\add* a pile of rubble is left.
\v 12 God has chosen that city of Jerusalem as the place where people will honor him \f + \ft metonymy \f*. What I desire is that he will get
rid of any king or any nation that tries to change this decree or tries to destroy that temple in Jerusalem. I, Darius, have
made this decree. It must be obeyed quickly and thoroughly. 
\s They completed and dedicated the temple 
\p
\v 13 Tattenai, the governor of the province, and \add his assistant\add* Shethar-Bozenai and their colleagues
\add read the message and\add* immediately obeyed the decree of King Darius.
\v 14 So the Jewish leaders continued their work \add of rebuilding the
temple\add*. They were greatly encouraged by the messages that the prophets Haggai and Zechariah preached. The Israelis
continued building the temple, just like God had commanded them to do and like King Cyrus had decreed.
\v 15 They finished building it on March 12, during the sixth year that King Darius
\add ruled\add*. 
\p
\v 16 Then the priests and the Levites and all the other Israeli people who had returned from Babylon very joyfully dedicated
the temple. 
\v 17 During \add the ceremony to\add* dedicate the temple, they sacrificed 100 young bulls, 200 rams, and 400 lambs. They also
sacrificed twelve male goats as an offering in order that \add God would
forgive\add* the sins of the people of the twelve tribes of Israel.
\v 18 Then the priests and Levites were divided into groups that would
\add take turns to\add* serve at the temple. They did this according to what Moses had written
\add many years previously\add* in the laws \add that he wrote\add*.
\s They celebrated the Passover festival 
\p
\v 19 On April 21, the Jews who had returned from Babylon celebrated the Passover Festival.
\v 20  \add To qualify themselves for offering the sacrifices\add*, the priests and Levites had already purified themselves by
performing certain rituals. Then they slaughtered the lambs for the benefit of all the people who had returned from Babylon,
for the other priests, and for themselves. 
\v 21 Those who had returned from Babylon and the other people in that land who had turned away from their immoral practices in
order to worship Yahweh, the God of the Israeli people, ate the Passover meal.
\v 22 They celebrated the Unleavened Bread Festival for seven days. The Israeli people throughout the land were joyful because
Yahweh had changed the attitude of the king of Assyria toward them, and as a result, the king had helped them to rebuild the
temple of God, the one whom they \add worshiped\add*.
