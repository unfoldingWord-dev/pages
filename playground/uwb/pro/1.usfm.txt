\s Warnings about sinful people 
\q
\v 8 My son, pay attention to what \add I\add*, your father, am teaching you.
\q And do not reject what your mother teaches you. 
\q
\v 9 What we teach you will be like a lovely turban around your head
\q2 and like a \add beautiful\add* necklace to put around your neck.
\b
\q
\v 10 My son, if sinners tempt\f + \ft Or: entice \f* you \add to do what is wrong\add*,
\q say "No" to them. 
\q
\v 11 They may say, "Come with us! Join us! 
\q2 We will hide and then kill \f + \ft metonymy \f* someone \add who passes by\add*.
\q2 We will ambush some helpless\f + \ft Or: innocent \f* people. 
\q
\v 12 We will kill them \f + \ft hyperbole \f* and get rid of them completely, 
\q2 just like \add people who are buried in\add* graves are gone forever.
\q While they are in good health, we will send them to the place where dead people are.
\q
\v 13 And we will seize all the things that they own. 
\q2 We will fill our houses with these things! 
\q
\v 14 So, come with us! 
\q Join our group! 
\q2 We will share with you the things that we steal." 
\q
\v 15 My son, do not go with them! 
\q2 Do not walk on the roads that they walk on\f + \ft Or: do what they do \f* \f + \ft metaphor \f*!
\q
\v 16 They rush to do evil deeds!

\q
\v 17 It is useless to put out a trap\f + \ft Or: net to catch a bird \f* because when a bird sees it,
\q2 \add it stays away from it\add*. 
\q
\v 18 But these wicked people are not like the birds

\q2 when they prepare to ambush someone to kill him, 
\q they will be killed themselves!

\add by violently attacking others\add*. 
\q2 They will only destroy themselves! 
\s Wisdom shouts in the streets 
\q
\v 20 Wisdom is \f + \ft personification \f* like a woman who shouts to people in the streets.
\q2 It is as if wisdom calls out to people in the plazas\f + \ft Or: town squares \f*.
\q
\v 21 It is as if wisdom calls out in noisy places, 
\q2 and at the entrances to the cities. 
\b
\q
\v 22 It is as if wisdom says, "How long will you stupid people continue to enjoy doing foolish things \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*?
\q2 How long will you people who ridicule God enjoy doing that \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*?
\q2 How long will you foolish people refuse to know \add what things are
right\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*? 
\q
\v 23 If you pay attention to me when I rebuke you, 
\q2 I will pour out to you what I am thinking in my inner being;
\q2 I will tell you my thoughts. 
\q
\v 24 But when I called to you, you refused to listen. 
\q I beckoned to you to come to me, 
\q2 but you ignored me. 
\q
\v 25 I tried to advise you, 
\q2 but you refused to listen to me. 
\q I tried to correct you, 
\q2 but you rejected what I told you. 
\q
\v 26 So now, when you are experiencing troubles\f + \ft Or: disasters \f*, 
\q2 I will laugh at you. 
\q When things happen that cause you to be afraid, 
\q2 I will make fun of you. 
\q
\v 27 When calamities strike you like a big storm, 
\q when disasters hit you like a violent wind, 
\q when all kinds of things distress you and give you trouble, 
\q2 I will ridicule you! 
\b
\q
\v 28 When foolish people call to me \add to help them\add*, 
\q2 I will not answer them. 
\q They will search for me diligently\f + \ft Or: everywhere \f*, 
\q2 but they will not find me. 
\q
\v 29 They refused to know \add what things are right\add*, 
\q2 and they decided not to revere Yahweh. 
\q
\v 30 They would not accept my advice, 
\q2 and they did not pay attention when I tried to correct them.
\q
\v 31 So they will endure what will result \f + \ft metaphor, doublet \f* from the evil way they have lived\f + \ft Or: behaved \f*
\q2 and the evil things they have planned to do. 
\q
\v 32 Those who turn away from me are stupid\f + \ft Or: foolish \f*; 
\q2 they will die because of doing that. 
\q
\v 33 But those who pay attention to me will live peacefully and safely,
\q2 and they will not be afraid that something will harm them."
