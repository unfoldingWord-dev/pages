\b
\q
\v 3  \add It causes pain to our bodies to carry heavy\add* stones or
\add a pail full of\add* sand, 
\q2 but doing something stupid\f + \ft Or: foolish \f* \add can cause\add* bigger
\add pain to other people's ◄spirits\f + \ft Or: inner \f* beings\add*►. 
\b

\b
\q

him\add*. 
\b
\q
\v 6 If a friend criticizes you, \add he is a good friend and\add* you can trust him;

to\add* deceive you. 
\b
\q

\b
\q
\v 10 Do not neglect your friends or your parents' friends;

\b
\q
\v 11 My child\f + \ft Or: son \f*, cause me to be happy by becoming wise, 
\q2 in order that I will know how to reply to those who would criticize me

\b
\q

\b
\q
\v 13  \add You deserve to\add* have your property taken from you

\\f + \\ft doublet \\f*. 
\b
\q
\v 14 If you rise early in the morning and call out a greeting to your neighbor

\q2 is as bad as listening to rain continually dripping on a rainy day.
\q
\v 16 Trying to restrain\f + \ft Or: stop \f* her from doing that is as difficult \\f + \\ft simile \\f* as trying to stop the wind
\q2 or trying to hold oil in your hand. 
\b
\q
\v 17 We can use one iron tool to sharpen another iron tool; 
\q2 similarly \\f + \\ft simile \\f*, \add when one person shares\add* what he is thinking, it can help other people
\add to think more clearly\add*. 
\b
\q
\v 18 Those who take care of fig trees will have figs to eat; 
\q2 similarly, servants who protect their master will be honored by him.
\b
\q
\v 19  \add When a person looks\add* in the water, he sees his own face;
\q2 similarly \\f + \\ft simile \\f*, \add when we look at\add* a person's behavior, we know what is in his inner being.
\b
\q
\v 20  \add It is as though\add* the place where the dead people are is always wanting more people to

\b
\q
\v 21  \add Workers put\add* silver and gold in a very hot furnace

\q
\v 22 Even if you beat\f + \ft Or: crush \f* a fool severely like \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* you pulverize grain with a pestle,

\b
\q
\v 23 Take good care of your flocks of sheep 
\q and herds of cattle, 
\q2
\v 24 because the money that you acquired \add from selling animals
previously\add* will not ◄last\f + \ft Or: stay \f* with you► forever; 
\q2 similarly \\f + \\ft simile \\f*, governments \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* certainly do not \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* last forever.
\q
\v 25 After you cut the hay \\f + \\ft doublet \\f* and \add store it to feed the animals in the winter
while\add* a new crop of hay is growing, 
\q
\v 26 you will be able to \add shear the sheep and\add* make clothes from the wool,
\q2 and you will get money from selling some of the goats to buy more land,
\q
\v 27 and you will get enough milk from the other goats 
\q2 for you and your family and your female servants.
