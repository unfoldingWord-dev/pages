\s Wise sayings from Agur 
\p
\v 1 These are sayings/messages that God gave to Agur, the son of Jakeh.
\q Agur wrote them for Ithiel and Ucal. 
\b
\q
\v 2 It seems that I am very stupid; 
\q2 I do not deserve to be considered to be a human; 
\q I do not have the good sense that humans should have. 
\q
\v 3 I have not learned \add how to become\add* wise 
\q2 and I do not know \add much\add* about God. 
\q
\v 4  \add But let me say this:\add* 
\q No one \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* has ascended to heaven \add to find out what God is
like\add* and returned \add to tell us\add*. 
\q No one \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* has gathered/held the wind in his hand. 
\q No one \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* has wrapped the water \add in the ocean\add* in \add a piece
of\add* cloth 
\q2 and no one \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* has established the boundaries of the earth.
\q \add If you know those things, tell me\add* \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* his name, and the names of his children \f + \fr sarcasm \f*.
\q \add But you do not know those things, so you cannot speak with authority about what God is
like\add*. 
\b
\q
\v 5 Everything that God has said is true; 
\q2 he is like a shield \f + \fr metaphor \f* for all those who request him to protect them.
\q
\v 6 Do not add to (OR, change) what God has said; 
\q2 if you do that, he will rebuke you and show that you are lying.
\b
\q
\v 7 God, I ask you to do two things for me; 
\q2 please do them before I die: 
\q
\v 8 Prevent me from lying or deceiving people 
\q2 and do not cause me to become poor or to become rich. 
\q2 Just give me the food that I need; 
\q
\v 9 because if I become rich, 
\q2 I might say that I do not \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* know you and that I do not need you;
\q and if I become poor, 
\q2 I might dishonor you by stealing things.
