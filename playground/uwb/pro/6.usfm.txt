\s Warnings against foolish behavior 
\q
\v 1 My son, if someone has borrowed money from a friend or a stranger,
\q2 and if you have promised that you will pay the money back if that person is unable to pay back the money he borrowed,
\q
\v 2 you may be trapped by what you have agreed to do, 
\q2 \add because if the one who borrowed the money is not able to pay it back, you will have to pay
it\add*. 
\q2 What you have said that you will do will be like a snare to you.
\q
\v 3 So, my son, I will tell you what you should do to escape from your difficulty,
\q2 so that the moneylender does not get control over your \add wealth:\add*
\q humbly go to your friend and plead with him \add to cancel the
agreement\add*! 
\q
\v 4 Do not wait until tomorrow; \add go immediately\add*! 
\q2 Do not rest until you \add go and talk with him\add*.

\v 5 Save yourself, 
\q2 like a deer that escapes from a deer hunter

\b
\q
\v 9 But you lazy loafer, how long will you continue to sleep \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*?
\q2 Are you never going to get up from sleeping \add and go to work\add*?

\b
\q
\v 12 I will describe for you what worthless and evil people are like.

\q2 they signal \add to their friends what they are intending\f + \ft Or: planning \f* to
do\add*. 
\q
\v 14 From within their inner beings they plan to do evil things.

\v 19 people who easily tell lies in court; 
\q3 and people who cause strife between family members.
