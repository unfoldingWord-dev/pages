\s More warnings about adultery

\v 1 My son, heed my advice, 
\q2 and \add guard my instructions as you would\add* \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* guard a treasure.
\q
\v 2 Obey my commands, 
\q2 and as a result you will live a good life. 
\q Consider the things that I teach you \add to be very precious to

\q2 Keep them in your inner being \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f*. 
\q
\v 4  \add Love\add* wisdom like you \add love\add* your sister.

\q
\v 5 If you are wise and if you understand what is wise \\f + \\ft personification \\f*, you will not
\add sleep with\add* an immoral woman;

\v 6 One day, I was standing at the window inside my house, 
\q2 and I looked outside. 
\q
\v 7 I saw some young men who did not have good sense. 
\q2 Among them was a man who was very foolish. 
\q
\v 8 He crossed the street near \add the house of\add* an immoral woman.
\q2 He was walking along the path toward her house 
\q
\v 9 at twilight, when it was getting dark \\f + \\ft doublet \\f*. 
\b
\q
\v 10 Suddenly the woman came out to see\f + \ft Or: meet \f* him. 
\q2 She was dressed ◄seductively\f + \ft Or: like \f* a prostitute►, intending to persuade him to sleep with her.
\q
\v 11 She was a loud talker, one who was rebellious; 
\q2 she \\f + \\ft synecdoche \\f* never stayed at home. 
\q
\v 12 She often went into the city streets and plazas\f + \ft Or: markets \f*, 
\q2 waiting to trap some man. 
\q
\v 13  \add When she saw that young man\add*, she put her arms around him and kissed him.
\q2 Then without being a bit ashamed, she said, 
\q
\v 14 “I have \add some meat that is left over from\add* a sacrifice that I made today
\add to restore fellowship with Yahweh\add*; 
\q2 I have fulfilled\f + \ft Or: done \f* what I promised him that I would do. 
\q
\v 15 And now I have come out to meet\f + \ft Or: see \f* you. 
\q2 I was searching for you and now I have found you! 
\q
\v 16 I have put on my bed sheets\f + \ft Or: bedspreads \f* that were made from very fine linen
\add that were imported\add* {\add people brought\add*} from Egypt.
\q
\v 17 I have sprinkled \add sweet-smelling\add* perfumes on my bed—
\q2 myrrh and aloes and cinnamon. 
\q
\v 18 Come with me; let us enjoy having sex until tomorrow morning.
\q2 Let's enjoy making love. 
\q
\v 19 My husband is not at home; 
\q2 he has gone away on a long journey. 
\q
\v 20 He is carrying a wallet filled with money, 
\q2 and he will not return until the middle of this month.” 
\b
\q
\v 21 So she persuaded him by her enticing\f + \ft Or: tempting \f* words. 
\q2 She allured him by her smooth\f + \ft Or: sweet \f* talk. 
\q
\v 22 And he went with her immediately, 
\q2 like an ox that was going to where it would be slaughtered, 
\q2 or like a deer \f + \ft (OR, a fool) \f* that is stepping into a noose\f + \ft Or: trap \f*,
\q2
\v 23 where it will remain\f + \ft Or: stay \f* until someone shoots an arrow into its liver
\add and kills it\add*. 
\q He was like a bird that flew into a trap. 
\q2 He did not know that ◄it would cost him his life\f + \ft Or: he \f* would die as a result►.
\b
\q
\v 24 My son, listen to what I say; 
\q2 pay careful attention to my words. 
\q
\v 25 Do not allow your inner being to arouse\f + \ft Or: persuade \f* you to go with an immoral woman like that.
\q2 Do not go where she goes. 
\q
\v 26 She has caused many men to be ruined; 
\q2 truly, no one can count the men she has killed. 
\q
\v 27 The road to her house is the road to the grave. 
\q2 Those who enter her bedroom \\f + \\ft personification \\f* will die as a result.
