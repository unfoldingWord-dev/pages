\v 3 ◄Can anyone count the angels who are in his army \add in heaven\add*?/No one can count the angels who are in his army
\add in heaven\add*.► [RHQ] 
\q2 ◄Is there any place where his light does not shine?/There is no place where his light does not shine.► [RHQ]
\q
\v 4 So, ◄how can God consider any person to be righteous?/God certainly cannot consider any person to be righteous.► [RHQ]
\q2 ◄How can any human being be truly pure?/No human being can be truly pure.► [RHQ]
\q
\v 5 Consider this: God does not even consider the full moon to be bright,
\q2 and he does not consider the stars to be spotless.
