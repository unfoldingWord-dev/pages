\c 32  
\s Elihu replied to Job and his three friends 
\p
\v 1 Then those three men stopped replying to Job, because \add they could not convince Job that he was wrong in claiming
that\add* he had not done anything that was wrong. 
\v 2 Then Elihu, the son of Barachel, a descendant of Buz, from the clan of Ram, became very angry at Job. He was angry because
Job continued to claim that he was righteous/innocent, and that God was wrong
\add to punish him\add*. 
\v 3 He was also angry with Job's three friends, because they had declared that Job must have done many things that were wrong,
but they were unable to convince Job \add that what they said was
true\add*. As a result, \add it seemed that\add* God did what was wrong by punishing Job.
\v 4 Elihu was younger than the others, so he waited \add until they had finished
speaking\add* before he replied to Job. 
\v 5 But when Elihu realized that the three men had no more to say [MTY] to Job, he became angry.
\p
\v 6 And this is what he said: 
\q “I am young, and you all are much older than I am. 
\q2 So, I was timid, and I was afraid to tell you what I was thinking.
\q
\v 7 I said \add to myself\add*, ‘Let those [PRS] who are much older speak,
\q2 because older people \add should be able to\add* say things that are wise.’
\q
\v 8 But the Spirit of Almighty \add God\add* is within people, and it is he that enables them to be wise.
\q
\v 9 It is not people becoming old that enables them to be wise;
\q2 not all old people understand what is right. 
\b
\q
\v 10 So, I say, ‘Listen to me, 
\q2 and allow me to declare what I think.’ 
\q
\v 11 I waited for you all to speak; 
\q2 I wanted to hear the wise things that you would say. 
\q2 I waited while you thought carefully about \add what would be the right
things\add* to say. 
\q
\v 12 I paid attention carefully, 
\q2 but surprisingly, none of you were able to prove that what Job said was wrong.
\q
\v 13 So, do not say \add to yourselves\add*, ‘We have discovered what is wise!’
\q2 It is God who must ◄refute Job/show that what Job said was wrong►, because you three have not been able to do that.
\q
\v 14 Job was replying to you, \add not to me\add*, 
\q2 but I will not reply to him by saying what you three said. 
\b
\q
\v 15 You three are dismayed \add because you have not been able to convince him that he was
wrong\add*, 
\q2 so you are not saying anymore to him [DOU]. 
\q
\v 16 But because you do not speak, I certainly will not wait any longer [RHQ];
\q2 you merely stand there and do not reply anymore. 
\q
\v 17 So now I also will reply to Job 
\q2 and say what I think. 
\q
\v 18 I have plenty to say, 
\q2 and my spirit compels me to say it. 
\q
\v 19 My inner being is like [SIM] a ◄wineskin/bag that has ‘new/fermenting’ wine in it►,
\q2 and it will soon burst. 
\q
\v 20 I must speak [MTY], in order that I do not have to keep holding what I want to say;
\q2 I must say something [MTY] to reply \add to you all\add*. 
\q
\v 21 I will speak \add fairly\add*, not favoring any of you, 
\q2 and I will not try to flatter anyone. 
\q
\v 22 I really do not know how to flatter people; 
\q2 and if I did that, God would soon get rid of me.”
