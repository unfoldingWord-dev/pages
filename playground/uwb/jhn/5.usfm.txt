\c 5  
\s John 5:1-13 
\s The Jewish leaders did not like the fact that Jesus healed a paralyzed man on the Sabbath day.
\p
\v 1 Some time later, Jesus went up to Jerusalem when the Jews were having
\add another\add* celebration. 
\v 2 At one of the gates \add into the city\add* called the Sheep Gate, there is a pool. In our language we call it Bethzatha.
\add Around the pool\add* were five open areas with roofs over them.
\v 3-4 Many people were lying there. They were people who were blind, lame, or
paralyzed.\f + send down an angel, and the angel would stir the water. Then the first person who got down into the water after
the water was stirred would be healed of whatever disease that person
had.”\f* 
\v 5 One of those who was there had been paralyzed for thirty-eight years.
\v 6 Jesus saw him lying there and found out that the man had been like that for a long time. He said to the man, “Do you want
to become well?” 
\v 7 The paralyzed man replied to him, “\add Yes\add*, sir, \add I want to get well,
but\add* there is no one to help me get down into the pool when the water is stirred {stirs}. While I am trying to get
\add to the pool\add*, someone else always gets there before me.”
\v 8 Jesus said to him, “Get up! Then pick up your mat and walk!”
\v 9 The man immediately was healed. He picked up his mat and started walking!
\p The day on which this happened was a Jewish day of rest. 
\v 10 So the Jewish \add leaders\add* said to the man who had been healed, “Today is the Sabbath\f + \ft Or: our rest day \f*, and
\add in our Jewish\add* laws \add it is written that people should not work on
our\add* \add Sabbath\f + \ft Or: rest day\add* \f*, so you should not be carrying your mat!”
\v 11 The man replied to them, “The man who healed me, he himself said to me, ‘Pick up your mat and walk!’”
\v 12 They asked him, “Who is the man who said to you, ‘Pick it up and walk!’?”
\v 13 But since Jesus had disappeared in the crowd \add without telling the man his
name\add*, the man did not know who it was \add who had healed him\add*.
\s John 5:14-18 
\s The Jewish leaders became very angry with Jesus for saying that he was the Son of God.
\p
\v 14 Later, Jesus found the man when he was in the Temple \add courtyard\add*. He
\add told the man his name, and\add* said to him, “Listen! You are healed! So stop sinning! If you do not stop sinning,
something will happen to you that will be worse \add than the illness you had
before\add*!” 
\v 15 The man went away and told the Jewish \add leaders\add* \f + \ft synecdoche \f* that it was Jesus who had healed him.
\v 16 So the Jewish \add leaders\add* \f + \ft synecdoche \f* started to harass Jesus, because Jesus was doing these things ◄on the Sabbath\f + \ft Or: on \f*
the Jewish rest day►. 
\v 17 Then Jesus replied to them, “My Father has always been working every day,
\add including\add* \add the Sabbath\f + \ft Or: the day of rest\add* \f*, up until now. I am doing the same thing!”
\v 18 The Jewish leaders \f + \ft synecdoche \f* considered that he was disobeying their rules about the Sabbath\f + \ft Or: the day of rest \f*, and that by
saying that God was his Father, he was making himself equal with God. And they considered that both these things were grounds
for killing him. So they sought even harder for a way to kill him.
\s John 5:19-45 
\s Jesus replied to their objections by stating five reasons why they should believe that he is the Son of God.
\p
\v 19 Jesus replied to them by saying, “You need to know this: I can do nothing by my own
\add authority\add*. I do only the \add kind of\add* things that I see
\add my\add* Father doing. Whatever kinds of things my Father is doing, those are the things I am doing.
\v 20  \add My\add* Father loves me, and he shows me everything that he is doing. He will show me
\add the miracles\add* that \add he wants me to do\add* that will be greater than the ones that
\add you have already seen me do\add*, so that you may be amazed.
\v 21  \add For example\add*, just like \add my\add* Father causes people who have died to rise up and be alive again, I will
give \add eternal\add* life to everyone that I want to. 
\v 22 Furthermore, \add my\add* Father is not the one who judges people
\add concerning their sins\add*. Instead, he has given to me the work of judging people,
\v 23 in order that all people may honor me, just like they honor
\add my\add* Father. \add My\add* Father\add considers that\add* anyone who does not honor me is not honoring
\add him\add*, the one who sent me. 
\v 24 Listen to this carefully: Those who hear my message and believe that
\add God\add* is the one who sent me have eternal life. \add God
will\add* not condemn them\f + \ft Or: say that he will punish them \f*. They are no longer separated from God. Instead, they have
\add eternal\add* life. 
\p
\v 25 Listen to this carefully: There will be a time when those who are spiritually dead\f + \ft Or: separated from God \f* will hear the
voice of me, the Son of God\f + \ft Or: the man who is also God \f*. In fact, it is that time already. Those who hear
\add and pay attention to my message\add* will have \add eternal\add* life.
\v 26  \add My\add* Father has \add power to\add* make things live. Similarly, he has given me the
\add power to enable\add* people to live \add eternally\add*. 
\v 27 Because I am the one who came from heaven, he has given me the authority to judge people
\add concerning their sins\add*. 
\v 28 Do not be surprised about that, because there will be a time when all people who have died will hear my voice
\v 29 and they will become alive again. Those who have lived good
\add lives\add* will rise \add from their graves\add* and live forever. But those who have lived evil lives will rise, and I
will ◄condemn them\f + \ft Or: declare \f* that I will punish them \add for their
sins\add*►. 
\v 30 I do not do anything \add like that\add* by my own authority. I judge people only according to what I hear
\add my Father tell me\add*. I will judge people fairly, because I do not want to please only myself. Instead, I want to please
\add my Father\add*, who sent me. 
\p
\v 31 If I were the \add only\add* one to tell people about myself,
\add people could rightly say that\add* what I say is not true. 
\v 32 But there is someone else who tells people about me. And I know that what he tells people about me is true.
\v 33 As for you, when you sent messengers to John \add the Baptizer to ask about
me\add*, he told the truth \add about me\add*. 
\v 34 I do not \add need that\add* people tell others \add about
me\add*. But instead, I am reminding \add you about what John told people about
me\add*, in order that you will \add believe it and\add* be saved
{\add God\add* will save you}. 
\v 35  \add John's message about me\add* \f + \ft Or: \add John\add* \f* \f + \ft metaphor \f* was
\add like\add* a lamp that shines brightly. For a short while you were willing to be made happy
\add by that message\add* {to let \add that message\add* make you happy}.
\p
\v 36 But there is something else that tells you about me. \add It should prove who I
am\add* more than what John \add said about me\add*. The miracles \f + \ft personification \f* that
\add my\add* Father told me to do, the miracles that I am performing, show \f + \ft Or: prove \f* to people that my Father sent me.
\v 37 Furthermore, \add my\add* Father, who sent me, tells people about me. You have never heard his voice or seen him.
\v 38 Furthermore, you have not believed in \add me\add*, the one he sent. So you have not
\add believed\add* his message in your inner beings. 
\v 39 You carefully study \f + \ft Or: Study \f* the Scriptures, because you think that by
\add studying\add* them you will \add find the way to\add* have eternal life. And those Scriptures tell people about me!
\v 40 But you refuse to come to me\f + \ft Or: to believe my message \f* in order that you may have
\add eternal\add* life. 
\p
\v 41 It does not \add matter to\add* me whether people praise me.
\v 42 But you \add want people to praise you\add*. I know that within yourselves you do not love God.
\v 43 Although I have come to earth with my Father's authority \f + \ft metonymy \f*, you do not accept me. But if someone else comes with his
own authority \f + \ft metonymy \f*, you accept him! 
\v 44 You accept your praising each other, but you do not try to do things that will result in God himself praising you. So
◄there is no way you can believe \add in me\add*!\f + \ft Or: how \f* can you believe
\add my message\add*?► \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* 
\p
\v 45 But do not think that I am the one who will accuse you while
\add my\add* Father is listening! No, it is Moses who will accuse you! You thought that he would
\add defend you\add*. 
\v 46 Moses wrote about me, so if you had believed what he \add wrote\add*, you would have believed what I
\add said\add*! 
\v 47 But because you did not believe what he wrote \add about me\add*, ◄you will certainly not believe what I say!\f + \ft Or: how \f* will
you believe what I say?► \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*”
