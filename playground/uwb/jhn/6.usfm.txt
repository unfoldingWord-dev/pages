\c 6  
\s John 6:1-15 
\s Jesus miraculously fed more than 5,000 people. 
\p
\v 1 Some time later, when Jesus was in Galilee district, near the time of the Jewish Passover celebration, Jesus went
\add with us disciples by boat\add* and crossed to another place along Galilee Lake. This lake is
\add also called\add* Tiberias Lake. 
\v 2 A large crowd of people kept following him \add on land\add* because they had been seeing the miracles he performed
\add by healing\add* sick people. 
\v 3 Jesus went up on the hillside and sat down with \add us\add* disciples
\add to teach us\add*. 
\v 4 Then he looked up and saw a great crowd of people coming toward him.
\v 5 He said to Philip, “Where will we buy food for all these people to eat?”
\v 6 He asked this only to find out if Philip believed what \add Jesus could
do\add*, because Jesus already knew what he himself was going to do.
\v 7 Philip replied to him, “\add Even if we had\add* the amount of money a man earns in eight months, that would not be enough
to buy bread so that each person could have a little bit!” 
\v 8 Another one of \add us\add* disciples, Andrew, who was Simon Peter's
\add younger\add* brother, said to him, 
\v 9 “There is a boy here who has five small barley loaves and two
\add cooked\add* fish. But they will not help much among so many people!\f + \ft Or: what good will that do among so many people? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*”
\v 10 Jesus said, “Tell the people to sit down!” There was plenty of grass there, so they all sat down. There were about five
thousand men \add among those\add* who sat down. 
\v 11 Then Jesus took the small loaves and the fish and thanked \add God\add* for them. Then he
\add gave them to us, and we\add* distributed the small loaves and the fish to all the people sitting on the ground.
\add Because God caused the food to keep increasing\add*, everyone ate as much as they wanted.
\v 12 When everyone had all the food they wanted, he said to \add us\add* disciples, “Gather up the pieces that are left over.
Do not let anything be wasted!” 
\v 13 So we gathered up the pieces of the small loaves that were left over by those who had eaten. We filled twelve baskets
with those pieces! 
\p
\v 14 After the people saw that miracle that Jesus had performed,
\add many of\add* them started to say, “Surely this is the prophet
\add like Moses\add* that \add God promised\add* to send to the world!”
\v 15 So, because Jesus realized that they were about to come and seize him to make him
\add their\add* king, he left them again and went up into the hills by himself.
\s John 6:16-24 
\s Jesus miraculously walked on the water. 
\p
\v 16 When it was evening, \add we\add* disciples went down to \add Galilee\add* Lake.
\v 17 When it became dark and Jesus had still not joined us\add ,
we\add* got into a boat and went across the lake towards Capernaum
\add city\add*. 
\v 18 A strong wind started to blow and caused the water to become very rough\f + \ft Or: to have high waves \f*.
\v 19 After we had rowed three or four miles\f + \ft Or: five or six kilometers \f*, we saw Jesus coming near the boat; he was walking on the
water! So we were terrified! 
\v 20 But he said to us, “Do not be afraid! It is I!” 
\v 21 We were glad to take him into the boat. As soon as \add we\add* did that, the boat reached the shore where
\add we\add* were going! 
\p
\v 22 The next day the crowd of people that had stayed on the other side of the lake
\add were perplexed about how Jesus had left that area\add*. They knew that there had been only one boat there
\add the previous day\add*. They knew that we had gone away in it by ourselves. They knew that Jesus had not gone with us.
\v 23 Then some \add men came\add* from Tiberias \add city\add* in boats.
\add They were hoping to take some of the crowd back to Tiberias\add*. They arrived near the place where the people had eaten
the food after Jesus had given thanks \add and caused it to multiply\add*.
\v 24 When the crowd realized that neither Jesus nor we disciples were there,
\add some of\add* them got into those boats and they sailed to Capernaum to find Jesus.
\s John 6:25-59 
\s Jesus taught them figuratively of the need for them to take for themselves the benefits of his sacrificing himself and
shedding his blood to atone for their sins. 
\p
\v 25 When they found him \add in Capernaum\add* further around the lake, they asked him, “Teacher,
\add since you(sg) did not come in a boat\add*, when \add and how\add* did you get here?”
\v 26 Jesus replied to them, “Listen to this carefully: Do you know why you are looking for me? It is not because you saw
\add me perform\add* miracles \add and as a result have realized who I really
am\add*. No! You are looking for me \add only\add* because you had plenty of bread to eat
\add after I provided it for you by performing a miracle\add*. 
\v 27 Stop desiring food that will soon spoil! Instead, desire to get
\add spiritual\add* food that will last forever! Yearn for eternal life! That is what I, the one who came from heaven, will
give you. God \add my\add* Father has shown that he approves of me
\add doing that\add*.” 
\p
\v 28 Then the people asked him, “What things should we do \add to
please\add* God?” 
\v 29 Jesus replied, “What God \add wants you\add* to do is this: He wants you to believe that
\add I am\add* the one he has sent.” 
\v 30 So they said to him, “Then perform \add another\add* miracle so that we may see it and believe that
\add you came from God\add*. What miracle would you like to perform?
\v 31 Our ancestors ate the \add food called\add* manna \add that God provided for them by a
miracle\add* in the desolate area. This is written {\add The Psalmist\add* wrote this}
\add in the Scriptures\add* about \add what Moses caused to happen:\add* ‘He gave them food from heaven to eat.’
\add Will you perform a miracle like that\add*?” 
\p
\v 32 So Jesus said to them, “The truth is that it was not Moses who gave your
\add ancestors\add* that food from heaven. No, it was my Father \add who gave it to them. And my Father is the
one\add* who gives you the true food from heaven. 
\v 33 The true bread from God came down from heaven, and he is the one who will give
\add eternal\add* life to \add the people of\add* the world \f + \ft metonymy \f*.”
\p
\v 34  \add Not understanding what he meant\add*, they said to him, “Sir, give us that kind of bread all the time!”
\v 35 Jesus said to them, “\add Just like\add* food \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add sustains physical
life\add*, I am the \add one who enables you to have spiritual\add* life. Those who
\add eat ordinary food and drinks will later be hungry and thirsty\add*. But those who come to me
\add to receive that life\add* will never again \add lack anything
spiritually\add*. 
\v 36 I told you before that you have seen my \add miracles, but after seeing them, instead of understanding who I
am\add*, you have not believed in me. 
\v 37 All the people that \add my\add* Father entrusts to me will come to me, and I will certainly welcome\f + \ft Or: never send away \f*
\f + \ft litotes \f* anyone who comes to me. 
\v 38 When I came down from heaven, it was not to do what I want. Instead, I came to do what
\add God\f + \ft Or: my Father\add* \f*, who sent me, wants. 
\v 39 What the one who sent me wants is that I keep forever all\f + \ft Or: never lose any \f* \f + \ft litotes \f* of those whom he has entrusted to me. He
wants me to cause all of them to become alive again ◄on the last day\f + \ft Or: on \f* the day
\add when I judge everyone\add*► \f + \ft metonymy \f*. 
\v 40  \add Long ago in the desolate area when those who were bitten by snakes looked at the bronze replica of a snake, they
were healed\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. What my Father wants is that \add similarly\add* everyone who looks at
\add what\add* I \add have done\add* and believes in me will have eternal life. I will cause them to become alive again on the
last day\f + \ft Or: on the day \add when I judge everyone\add* \f* \f + \ft metonymy \f*.” 
\p
\v 41 The Jewish \add leaders\add* \f + \ft synecdoche \f* began to grumble about him because he said, “I am the one who is
\add like\add* true bread who came down from heaven.” 
\v 42 They said, “This man is Jesus, the son of Joseph!\f + \ft Or: Isn't this man the son of Joseph? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* We know
\add the names of\add* both his father and his mother. \add He certainly did not come from
heaven\add*, so he is \add lying\add* by saying ‘I came from heaven.’\f + \ft Or: why is he now saying, ‘I came from heaven?’ \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*”
\v 43 Jesus replied to them, “Stop grumbling among yourselves \add about what I just
said\add*! 
\v 44  \add My\add* Father, who sent me, makes people want to come to me. No others will come to me
\add to receive eternal life\add*. Those who come to me are the only ones who will believe in me. I will cause them to be
alive again\f + \ft Or: raise them \add from the dead\add* \f* ◄on the last day, Or: on the
\add judgment\add* day►. 
\v 45 It was written ◄\add by one of the prophets\f + \ft Or: by \f* the prophet
Isaiah\add*► {\add One of the prophets\f + \ft Or: The prophet Isaiah\add* \f* wrote}
\add about all those who will trust in me\add*, ‘God will teach them all.’ Everyone who listens to what
\add my\add* Father \add says\add* and learns from him will come to\f + \ft Or: believe in \f* me.
\v 46 I came from God. I am the only one who has seen \add my\add* Father. No one else has seen him.
\v 47 Listen to this carefully: Everyone who believes ◄\add my message\f + \ft Or: in \f*
me\add*► has eternal life. 
\v 48  \add Just like\add* food \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add sustains your physical
life\add*, I am the \add one who enables you to have spiritual\add* life.
\v 49 Even though your ancestors ate the manna \add while they were
traveling\add* in the desolate area, they died \add anyway\add*.
\v 50 But the bread \add I am talking about\add* is something that came down from heaven. If people eat that bread, their
\add spirits\add* will never die. 
\v 51 I am the one who came down from heaven to enable people to have
\add spiritual\add* life. If people take what I will give them, they will live forever. What I will give them is my flesh,
which I will give to \add all the people in\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* the world in order that they may have
\add spiritual\add* life.” 
\p
\v 52 Then the Jewish \add leaders\add* \f + \ft synecdoche \f* began to argue among themselves. They said, “There is no way this man can give
us his flesh to eat!\f + \ft Or: How can this man give us his flesh to eat? \f*” \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 53 So, \add speaking figuratively of the need for them to accept for themselves the benefits of his sacrificing himself and
shedding his blood to atone for their sins\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, Jesus said to them, “Listen carefully to this:
\add Although\add* I am the one who came from heaven, if you do not eat my flesh and drink my blood, you will not have eternal
life. 
\v 54 Those who eat my flesh and drink my blood have eternal life, and I will cause them to become alive again at the last
day\f + \ft Or: the \add judgment\add* day \f*, 
\v 55 because my flesh and my blood are truly spiritual food. 
\v 56 Those who eat my flesh and drink my blood will have a close relationship with me, and I will have a close relationship
with them. 
\v 57  \add My\add* Father, who is the \add source of everything
that\add* lives, sent me, and I live because \add my\add* Father has
\add given me life\add*. Similarly those who eat my \add flesh\add* will live
\add eternally\add* because of what I \add do for them\add*. 
\v 58  \add I am\add* the true bread that came down from heaven. Although our ancestors ate
\add manna\add*, they \add later\add* died \add anyway\add*. But those who eat this bread will live forever.”
\v 59 He said this while he was teaching people in the synagogue\f + \ft Or: the Jewish meeting place \f* in Capernaum.
\s John 6:60-71 
\s Some of Jesus' disciples left him because of this teaching. 
\p
\v 60 After they heard him say that, many of his disciples said, “What he is teaching is hard
\add to understand\add*; it is very difficult for anyone to accept it!\f + \ft Or: how can anyone accept it? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*”
\v 61 Jesus was aware that his disciples were grumbling about it, so he said to them, “I am sorry that this is offending
you.\f + \ft Or: Is this offending you? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* 
\v 62 ◄\add Perhaps you will believe my message\add* if you see me, the one who came from heaven, ascending
\add there\add* to where I was before!\f + \ft Or:  \f*\add (What will you think if you see
me\add*, the one who came from heaven, ascending \add there\add* to where I was before)?► \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 63  \add God's\add* Spirit is the one who gives people \add eternal\add* life. Human efforts are no help at all
\add for giving people eternal life\add*. The message I have spoken to you
\add gives spiritual\add* life \f + \ft Or: \add comes from\add* God's Spirit
\add and gives eternal\add* life. \f* 
\v 64 But there are some of you who do not believe \add my message.” Jesus said
that\add* because he knew from the time he started \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add his
ministry\add* which of them would not believe his message. He also knew who would betray him\f + \ft Or: enable his enemies to seize him \f*.
\p
\v 65 Then he continued by saying, “That is why I told you that only those whom my Father has enabled
\add to believe in me\add* will come to me \add and receive eternal
life\add*.” 
\p
\v 66 From that \add time\add*, many of his disciples left him and no longer went with him.
\v 67 So he said to \add us\add* twelve \add apostles\add*, “You do not want to leave me also, do you?”
\v 68 Simon Peter replied to him, “Lord, \add we\add* will not\add leave
you\add*, \add because\add* ◄there is no other person \add like you\add* to whom we can go!\f + \ft Or: what \f* other person is there like
\add you\add* to whom we can go?► \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* You have the message about eternal life!
\v 69 We have come to believe for certain that you are the holy one
\add who has come\add* from God!” 
\v 70 Then Jesus replied to us, “\add You are saying that as though
all\add* you twelve\add men\add* whom I have chosen \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* believe that. But one of you is
\add under the control of\add* Satan!” 
\v 71 He was talking about Judas, the \add son\add* of Simon, from Kerioth
\add village\add*. \add Even though\add* Judas was one of us twelve
\add apostles\add*, he was about to betray Jesus\f + \ft Or: to enable Jesus' enemies to seize him \f*.
