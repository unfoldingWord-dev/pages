\c 21  
\s John 21:1-14 
\s Jesus appeared to seven disciples and enabled them miraculously to catch a lot of fish.
\p
\v 1 After that, Jesus showed himself to \add us\add* disciples when we were at Tiberias Lake,
\add which is another name for Galilee Lake\add*. This is what happened:
\v 2 Simon Peter, Thomas who was called \f + \ft Or:whom \add we\add* called \f* The Twin, Nathaniel from Cana
\add town\add* in Galilee, my older brother and I, and two other disciples were together.
\v 3 Simon Peter said to us, "\add I\add* am going to \add try to\add* catch some fish." We said, "We will go with you." So we
went down \add to the lake\add* and got in the boat. But that night we caught nothing.
\v 4 Early the next morning, Jesus stood on the shore, but we did not know that it was Jesus.
\v 5 He called out to us, "My friends, you have not \add caught\add* any fish, have you?" We answered, "You are correct,
\add we have not caught any\add*." 
\v 6 He said to us, "Throw your net out from the right-hand side of the boat! Then you will find some!" We did that, and we
caught so many fish \add in the net\add* that we were unable to pull the net into
\add the boat\add*! 
\v 7  \add But I knew that it was Jesus\add*, \add so\add* I said to Peter, "It is the Lord!" Peter had taken off his cloak
\add while he was working\add*, but as soon as he heard \add me say\add* "It is the Lord!" he wrapped his cloak around himself
and jumped into the water \add and swam to shore\add*. 
\v 8 The rest of us came \add to the shore\add* in the boat, pulling the net full of fish. We were not far from shore, only
about a hundred yards\f + \ft Or: meters \f*. 
\v 9 When \add we\add* got to the shore, we saw that there was a fire of burning coals there, with a
\add large\add* fish on the fire, and \add some\add* buns. 
\v 10 Jesus said to us, "Bring some of the fish that you have just caught!"
\v 11 Simon Peter got in \add the boat\add* and dragged the net to the shore. It was full of large fish. There were 153 of
them! But in spite of there being so many fish, the net was not torn.
\v 12 Jesus said to us, "Come and eat some breakfast!" None of us dared to ask him, "Who are you?" because we knew that it was
the Lord. 
\v 13 Jesus came and took the buns and gave them to us. He did the same with the fish.
\v 14 That was the third time that Jesus appeared to \add us\add* disciples after
\add God\add* caused him to become alive again after he died. 
\s John 21:15-19 
\s Jesus asked Peter three times if he really loved Jesus. Then Jesus told Peter how Peter would die.
\p
\v 15 When we had finished eating, Jesus said to Simon Peter, "John's
\add son\add* Simon, do you love me more than these \add other disciples
do\add*?" Peter said to him, "Yes, Lord, you know that you are dear to me \f + \ft Or: that I love you \f*." Jesus said, "Give to
\add those who belong to\add* me \add what they need spiritually,
like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add a shepherd provides\add* food for his lambs."
\v 16 Jesus said to him again, "John's \add son\add* Simon, do you love me?" He replied, "Yes, Lord, you know that you are dear
to me \f + \ft Or: that I love you \f*." Jesus said to him, "Take care of \add those who belong
to\add* me, \add like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* a \add shepherd takes care of his\add* sheep."
\v 17 Jesus said to him a third time, "John's son Simon, am I really dear to you \f + \ft Or: do you really love me \f*?" Peter was
grieved because Jesus asked him this three times, \add and because the third time he changed the
question\add*. He said, "Lord, you know everything. You know that you are dear to me \f + \ft Or: that I love you \f*." Jesus said, "Give
to \add those who belong to\add* me \add what they need spiritually,
as\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add a shepherd provides\add* food for \add his\add* sheep.
\v 18 Now listen to this carefully: When you were young, you put your clothes on by yourself, and you went wherever you wanted
to go. But when you are old, you will stretch out your arms, and someone will fasten them
\add with a rope\add* and will lead you to a place where you do not want to
\add go\add*." 
\v 19 Jesus said this to indicate how Peter would die \add violently\f + \ft Or: on a
cross\add* \f* in order to honor God. Then Jesus said to him, "Keep being my faithful disciple
\add until you die\add*." 
\s John 21:20-23 
\s Peter asked Jesus what would happen to John. 
\p
\v 20 Peter turned around and saw that I was following them. I was the one who leaned close to Jesus during the
\add Passover\add* meal and said, "Lord, who is going to enable your enemies to seize you?"
\v 21 When Peter saw me, he asked, "Lord, what \add is going to happen\add* to him?"
\v 22 Jesus said to him, "If I want him to remain \add alive\add* until I return, that is not your concern!\f + \ft Or: what is that to
you? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* You be my \add faithful\add* disciple!" 
\v 23 Some of the other believers heard \add a report of\add* what Jesus had said about me, and
\add they thought that Jesus meant\add* that I would not die. But Jesus did not say that I would not die. He said only, "If I
want him to remain \add alive\add* until I return, that is not your concern!\f + \ft Or: what is that to you? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*"
\s John 21:24-25 
\s A statement about the truth and accuracy of this document. 
\p
\v 24  \add I, John\add*, am the disciple who has seen all these things and I have written them down.
\p We \add elders of the congregation at Ephesus\add* know that what
\add John has written\add* is true. 
\p
\v 25 Jesus did many other things. If they would\add all\add* be written \f + \ft Or:If people would write them
\add all\add* \f* down \add in detail\add*, I suppose that the whole world would not have enough space \f + \ft hyperbole \f* to contain the books
that would be written \f + \ft Or:that they would write \f* \add about what he
did\add*.
