\c 10  
\s John 10:1-21 
\s Jesus explained why he is like a good shepherd. 
\p
\v 1  \add Jesus continued by saying to us\add*, "Listen carefully to what I say. Anyone who does not enter
\add the sheep pen\add* through the gate, if he climbs in some other way, he is a thief or a bandit.
\v 2 The man who enters \add the pen\add* through the gate is the shepherd of the sheep.
\v 3 The man who watches the gate at \add night\add* opens the gate for him. The sheep recognize the shepherd's voice. He
summons his own sheep by \add calling out\add* the names \add he has
given\add* them. Then he leads them outside\add the pen\add*. 
\v 4 After he has brought out all his own \add sheep\add*, he goes in front of them. His sheep follow him because they
recognize \add and pay attention to\add* his voice. 
\v 5 But they will never follow a stranger. Instead, they will run away from him, because they do not recognize a stranger's
voice." 
\p
\v 6 Jesus said that \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add to illustrate the difference between himself and the Pharisees, who were deceiving the
people\add*. But they did not understand what he was telling them.
\v 7 So Jesus spoke to them again. He said, "Listen carefully to what I am saying. I am
\add like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* a gate for the sheep \add to enter the sheepfold, because I am the one who allows people to enter God's
presence\add*. 
\v 8 All of \add your religious leaders\add* who have come previously
\add without my authority\add* are \add like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* thieves and bandits
\add because they act violently and dishonestly for their own benefit\add*. But
\add just like\add* sheep do not \add obey strangers, God's people do
not\add* pay attention to them. 
\v 9 I am \add like\add* a gate. Those will be saved \f + \ft Or:\add God\add* will save all those \f* who come
\add to God\add* by \add trusting in\add* me. \add Just like sheep\add* go in and out
\add through the gate safely\add* to find pasture \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add I will provide for them and protect
them\add*. 
\v 10 Thieves come \add to a sheep pen\add* only to steal or kill or destroy
\add sheep\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. \add Similarly, your religious leaders injure God's people
spiritually\add*. But I have come in order that people may have \add eternal\f + \ft Or: spiritual \f*\add* life, and that they may have
abundantly \add all they need to sustain them spiritually\add*. 
\p
\v 11 I am \add like\add* a good shepherd. A good shepherd \add is willing
to\add* die to save the sheep \f + \ft metaphor \f*. \add Similarly, I am ready to sacrifice myself to save those who belong to
me\add*. 
\v 12 A worker whom someone has hired \add to look after the sheep\add* is not
\add like\add* the shepherd or the one who owns the sheep. So when he sees a wolf coming, he leaves the sheep and runs away.
Then the wolf attacks the flock of sheep and \add seizes one sheep
and\add* causes\add the others\add* to scatter. 
\v 13 The worker runs away because he is \add only\add* a man whom someone has hired. He is not
\add really\add* concerned about \add what happens to\add* the sheep \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\add Similarly, your religious teachers do not really care what happens to
you\add*. 
\v 14 I am \add like\add* a good shepherd. \add Just like a good shepherd knows
his\add* sheep \f + \ft metaphor \f*, I know those who belong to me, and they know me
\v 15 in the same way as \add my\add* Father knows me and I know
\add my\add* Father. Furthermore, I am \add ready to\add* sacrifice myself for
\add those who belong to me\add*. 
\v 16 And I have other people \add who are not Jews\add* who \add will some
day\add* belong to me. They will be \add like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* sheep from another sheep pen. I must bring them
\add to God\f + \ft Or: myself \f*\add* also. They will pay attention to what I say, and eventually
\add all those who belong to me\add* will be \add like\add* one flock, and
\add I\add* will be \add like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* their one shepherd. 
\v 17 The reason \add my\add* Father loves me is that I will sacrifice my life. But
\add after I do that\add*, I will become alive again. 
\v 18 No one is causing me to die. Instead, I \add have chosen to\add* sacrifice myself. I have authority to sacrifice myself
and I have authority to become alive again. That is what my Father has commanded me to do."
\p
\v 19 After hearing these words\add that Jesus said\add*, the Jews were divided again.
\v 20 Many of them said, "A demon is \add controlling\add* him and has caused him to become crazy. It is useless to listen to
him!\f + \ft Or: Why should we listen to him? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*" 
\v 21 But others said, "What he is saying is not something a man whom a demon is controlling would say. No demon could enable
a blind man to see \add like he did!\f + \ft Or: \add*How could a demon enable a blind man to see
\add like he did\add*? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*" 
\s John 10:22-42 
\s The Jewish leaders tried to kill or arrest Jesus for claiming that he was equal with God.
\p
\v 22 Then it was time for the celebration \add to remember when our
ancestors\add* rededicated \add the Temple in Jerusalem\add*. It was in winter.
\v 23 Jesus was in the Temple \add courtyard\add*, walking in \add the place that people called
King\add* Solomon's porch. 
\v 24 The Jewish \add leaders\add* \f + \ft synecdoche \f* gathered around him and said, "How long will you keep us from knowing for sure
\add if you are the Messiah\add*? If you are the Messiah, tell us clearly!"
\v 25 Jesus answered them, "I have told you \add that I am the Messiah\add*, but you do not believe me! You should know who I
am because of the miracles I do with my Father's authority \f + \ft metonymy \f*.
\v 26 But instead, you do not believe in me because you do not belong to
\add me. You are like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* sheep \add who belong to a different
shepherd\add*. 
\v 27  \add Just like sheep\add* heed the voice \add of their true
shepherd\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, my \add people pay attention to what I say\add*. I know them, and they have become my disciples.
\v 28 I will give them eternal life. No one will separate them from me, not ever. No one shall ever pull them away from
belonging to me. 
\v 29  \add Those\add* that my Father has given to me are more precious than anything else \f + \ft Or: My Father, who has given them
to me, is greater than anything that opposes them \f*. So no one can pull them away from belonging to him \f + \ft metonymy \f*.
\v 30  \add My\add* father and I are equal." 
\p
\v 31 The Jewish \add leaders\add* \f + \ft synecdoche \f* again picked up stones to throw at him
\add and kill him because they were angry at his saying that he was equal with
God\add*. 
\v 32 But Jesus said to them, "You have seen me perform many miracles that my Father
\add told me to do. You should realize from seeing them that I am equal with
God\add*. So because of which of these miracles \f + \ft irony \f* are you wanting to
\add kill me by\add* throwing stones at me?" 
\v 33 The Jewish \add leaders\add* \f + \ft synecdoche \f* replied, "We are \add wanting
to\add* throw stones at you not because you performed a great miracle. Instead,
\add we are wanting to do it\add* because you are dishonoring God. You are just a man, but you are saying that you are God!"
\v 34 Jesus replied to them, "In the Scriptures it is written \f + \ft Or:\add someone\f + \ft Or: the
Psalmist\add* \f* has written \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add what God said to the rulers whom he had
appointed\add*, 'I have said that you are \add like\add* gods.' 
\v 35 God said that \add to those leaders when he appointed them. No one objected to
that\add*. And nothing that is in Scripture can be set aside \f + \ft Or:no one can set aside anything that is in Scripture \f*.
\v 36 But I am the one \add my\add* Father set apart to completely belong to him. He sent me here into this world. So why are
you angry with me for saying that \add I am equal with God when I
say\add* that I am the Son of God?\f + \ft Or: you should not be angry with me for saying that
\add I am equal with God when I say\add* that I am the person who is both God and man! \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 37 If I were not doing the miracles that my Father \add told me to do, I would not
expect\add* you to believe in me. 
\v 38 But because I perform these miracles, believe \add what\add* these miracles
\add show about me\add*, even though you do not believe what I \add say\add*. If you do that, then you will know and understand
that \add my\add* Father has a close relationship with me, and I have a close relationship with
\add my\add* Father." 
\p
\v 39 After they heard that, they tried to seize him again, but he got away from them.
\p
\v 40 Then Jesus went, along \add with us\add*, back across \add to the east side
of\add* the Jordan \add River\add*. We went to the place where John was previously baptizing
\add people\add*. He\f + \ft Or: We \f* stayed there \add for a few weeks\add*. 
\v 41 Many people came to him. They were saying, "John never performed a miracle,
\add but this man has performed many miracles\add*! Everything that John said about this man is true!"
\v 42 Many people \add who came\add* there believed \add that he was the Messiah\f + \ft Or: that he truly had come from
God\add* \f*.
