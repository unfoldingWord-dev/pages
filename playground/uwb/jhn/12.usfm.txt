\p
\v 1 Six days before the Passover \add celebration started\add*, Jesus arrived in Bethany
\add village, along with us\add*. That was where Lazarus lived. He was the man Jesus
\add previously\add* caused to be alive again after he died. 
\v 2 There they gave a dinner to \add honor\add* Jesus. Martha served the meal.
\add Her younger brother\add*, Lazarus, was among the people who were eating with him.
\v 3 Then Mary took \add a bottle\add* of expensive perfume \add called\add* nard and poured it on Jesus' feet
\add to honor him\add*. Then she wiped his feet with her hair. The whole house was filled with the
\add beautiful\add* smell of the perfume. 
\p
\v 4 But one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, \f + \ft Or: Judas, the man from Kerioth village \f* objected. He was the one who later
enabled Jesus' enemies to seize him. 
\v 5 He said, “◄We should have sold this perfume and given \add the
money\add* to poor people!\f + \ft Or: Why \f* did \add we\add* not sell this perfume and give
\add the money for it\add* to the poor people?► \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* We could have gotten three hundred days' wages for it!”
\v 6 He said that, not because he cared about the poor people, but instead, because he was a thief. He was the one who kept the
bag \add of funds that people gave to help Jesus and us his disciples\add*, and he often stole some of the money that was {that
\add people\add*} put into it. 
\v 7 Then Jesus said, “Do not bother her! \add She bought\add* this perfume
\add in order to save it\add* until the day when they will bury me
\add after I die\add*. 
\v 8 There will always be poor people among you, \add so you can help them whenever you want
to\add*. But I will not be with you much longer, \add so it is good that she showed right now how much she appreciates
me\add*.” 
\s John 12:9-11 
\s The Jewish leaders decided to kill Lazarus, too. 
\p
\v 9 A large crowd of Jews heard \add people say\add* that Jesus was there
\add in Bethany\add*. So they came, not only \add to see\add* Jesus but also to see Lazarus, the man whom he had caused to
become alive again after he died. 
\v 10 So the chief priests decided to kill Lazarus also, 
\v 11 because many of the Jews were \add deserting them and\add* going to Jesus and believing in him because of
\add Jesus causing\add* Lazarus \add to be alive again\add*. 
\s John 12:12-19 
\s Jesus entered Jerusalem as a king, but a humble one. 
\p
\v 12 The next day the huge crowd of people that had come \add to
Jerusalem\add* for the \add Passover\add* celebration heard \add people
say\add* that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem. 
\v 13 So they \add cut\add* branches from some palm trees and took the branches out
\add of the city\add* to \add wave them when they\add* met him. Some of them were shouting things like, “Hooray!” “May the Lord
\add God\add* bless the one who is coming with his authority \f + \ft metonymy \f*!” Some other people were shouting,
“\add May God bless\add* the King of Israel!” 
\v 14 When Jesus \add came near to Jerusalem\add*, he got a young donkey and sat on it
\add as he rode into the city\add*. By doing this, \add he fulfilled\add* what had been written {what
\add a prophet\add* had written} \add in Scripture\add*, 
\q
\v 15 You people of Jerusalem, 
\q do not be afraid! 
\q Look! Your king is coming! 
\q He is riding on a donkey's colt! 
\p
\v 16 At first \add we\add* disciples did not understand those things. But after Jesus had returned to heaven, we realized that
those things had been written {that \add a prophet\add* had written those things} about him, and that
\add by\add* doing those things for him \add the people had fulfilled what the prophet
prophesied\add*. 
\p
\v 17 The crowd that was with him continued to tell other people that he called Lazarus to come out of the tomb,
\add and that Lazarus had then become alive again\add*. 
\v 18 Because of that, many people, because they heard \add others
say\add* that he had performed this miracle, went to meet him. 
\v 19 So the Pharisees said to each other, “It is obvious that we are making no progress
\add in trying to stop him! It looks like\add* \f + \ft hyperbole \f* everyone \f + \ft metonymy \f* is becoming his disciple!”
\s John 12:20-28a 
\s Jesus told some Greeks what people who wanted to be his disciples had to be ready to do.
\p
\v 20 Among those who went up \add to Jerusalem\add* to worship \add God\add* during the
\add Passover\add* celebration were some Greeks. 
\v 21 They came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida \add town\add* in Galilee
\add province\add*. They \add wanted him\add* to do something for them. They said, “Sir, we would like to talk with Jesus.”
\v 22 So after Philip went and told that to Andrew, they both went and told Jesus.
\v 23 Then, \add to show them that he must die in order to give eternal life to non-Jews like those
Greeks\add*, Jesus replied to them, “It is time for \add God\add* to honor me, the one who came from heaven.
\add That will happen when I die\add*. 
\v 24 Listen to this carefully: \add My life is like a seed\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. If
\add someone\add* does not plant a kernel of grain in the ground, it does not change. It remains only one
\add seed\add*. But if it changes \add after it is planted in the ground, it will grow
and\add* produce many seeds. 
\v 25 Anyone who strongly wants to keep on living \add here on earth\add* will surely lose his life forever. But anyone who is
willing to die \f + \ft hyperbole \f* \add for my sake\add* will surely gain eternal life.
\v 26 If \add any of these Greeks or\add* anyone \add else\add* wants to serve me, they must become my disciples. Then,
\add after they die\add*, they will be where I am, \add in heaven\add*. My Father will honor all those who serve me.
\p
\v 27 Now I am disturbed in my inner being. I do not know what to say.\f + \ft Or: What shall I say? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* Should I say,
‘\add My\add* Father, save me from this time \add when I will suffer and
die!’\add*? No, \add I should not say that, because\add* the reason I came
\add into this world\f + \ft Or: from heaven\add* \f* was that I would\add suffer\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* now.
\v 28 My Father, show how great you are!” 
\s John 12:28b-36a 
\s God encouraged Jesus about his coming death by a voice from heaven.
\p Then \add God\add* spoke \f + \ft euphemism \f* from heaven, saying, “I have already shown how great
\add I am\add*, and I will do it again!” 
\v 29 The crowd that was there heard \add it but they did not understand the words. Some
said\add* it was thunder. Others said an angel had spoken to him.
\v 30 Jesus replied to them, “The voice that you heard speaking \add was God's voice,
but\add* it was not for my benefit. It was for your benefit! 
\v 31 Now is the time for \add God\add* to judge \add the people
in\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* the world. Now is the time when \add I\add* will destroy
\add the power of Satan\add*, the one who rules this world. 
\v 32 But as for me, when I am lifted {when \add men\add* lift me} up from the ground
\add on a cross, I will make a way for\add* gathering everyone to myself.”
\v 33 He said this to show us the way in which he was going to die.
\p
\v 34  \add Someone in\add* the crowd answered him, “We understand from the Scriptures that the Messiah will live forever. So
why do you say that the one who came from heaven, \add who is the
Messiah\add*, will be lifted up {that \add men\add* will lift up the one who came from heaven,
\add who is the Messiah\add*,} on a cross? What kind of man who came from heaven are
you\add talking about\add*? \f + \ft Or: That's not the \add kind\add* of Messiah
\add we are expecting\add*! \f*” 
\v 35 Then Jesus said to them, “\add My message is like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* a light for you.
\add I\add* will be with you for only a little while longer. Live and act
\add as you should\add* while I am still with you\add , because suddenly you will have no more opportunity to hear my message!
You do not want to be like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add someone\add* who cannot see where he is going
anymore\add when it suddenly\add* becomes dark! 
\v 36 Believe in my message \f + \ft metaphor \f* while you still have an opportunity to do it, in order that you may become people who have my
truth \f + \ft metaphor \f* within you!” 
\s John 12:36b-43 
\s Most of the Jewish leaders continued to reject Jesus' message.
\p After he said those things, Jesus left them and hid from them.
\v 37 Although he had done many miracles while people were watching,
\add most of\add* them refused to believe that he \add is\add* ◄\add the Messiah\f + \ft Or: from \f*
God\add*►. 
\v 38  \add Their stubbornness and refusal to believe was similar to the stubbornness of the people
that\add* the prophet Isaiah wrote about long ago. 
\q Lord, hardly anyone has believed our message!\f + \ft Or: who has believed our message? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\q Most people refused to accept it, 
\q even though you showed them your power! 
\q
\v 39 That was the reason why they were unable to believe. \add It was
like\add* Isaiah wrote somewhere else that God said: 
\q
\v 40 They have \add refused to understand; they acted as though they
were\add* blind people! 
\q They were insensible in their inner beings! 
\q As a result, they have not perceived \add my truth\add*! 
\q They have not understood it in their inner beings! 
\q They have not turned \add from their sinful lives\add*, 
\q2 and because of that I cannot help them! 
\p
\v 41 Isaiah wrote that because \add it was as though\add* he saw
\add ahead of time\add* how great Jesus would be, and he prophesied
\add those things\add* about him. 
\p
\v 42 Although most of the Jewish \add leaders\add* \f + \ft synecdoche \f* did not believe that Jesus is
\add the Messiah\f + \ft Or: from God\add* \f*, some of them believed in him. But they would not tell anyone that they believed in him,
because \add they were afraid that if they said that\add*, the Pharisees would not let them worship in the synagogues.
\v 43 They wanted people to praise them more than they wanted God to praise them.
\s John 12:44-50 
\s Jesus warned that God would condemn those who rejected his message.
\p
\v 44  \add Another day, when\add* Jesus \add was teaching the people,
he\add* shouted, “Those who believe in me, they are not believing in
\add me alone\add*. Instead, \add it is as though\add* they also believe in the one who sent me.
\v 45 When they see me \add and what I am doing, it is as though\add* they are seeing the one who sent me.
\v 46 I have come into the world \add to show people God's truth\add*, as a light
\add shows people what is around them\add*. I have come in order that people who believe in me will not remain
\add ignorant of God's truth\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add as those who are\add* in the darkness
\add are ignorant of what is around them\add*. 
\p
\v 47 As for those who hear my message but do not obey \add its commands\add*, I am not
\add the one who\add* judges them. \add The main reason\add* that I came
\add into the world\f + \ft Or: from heaven\add* \f* was not to judge \add the people
of\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* the world. Instead, I came to save them \add from being punished for their
sins\add*. 
\v 48 There is something that will judge those who reject me and do not accept my message. On the judgment day
\add God\add* will condemn them\add because they rejected\add* the message that I have told them.
\v 49 I have not said things from my own \add authority\add*. Instead,
\add my\add* Father, the one who sent me, instructed me what to say and how I should say it.
\v 50 I know that \add paying attention to\add* what he has instructed us
\add leads to\add* eternal life. So whatever I say is exactly \f + \ft Or: only \f* what
\add my\add* Father has told me to say.” 
\s John 13:1-17 
\s Jesus washed the disciples' feet as an example of humble service to each other.
