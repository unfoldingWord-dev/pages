\c 19  
\s John 19:1-16a 
\s Pilate finally permitted them to crucify Jesus. 
\p
\v 1 Then Pilate took Jesus \add inside and had soldiers\add* ◄scourge Jesus/hit Jesus with a whip that had pieces of metal or
bone fastened to it►. 
\v 2 The soldiers also took \add some branches with\add* thorns and wove them to make
\add something like\add* a crown. Then they put it on his head. They also put a purple robe on him.
\add They did these things to ridicule him by pretending that he was a
king\add*. 
\v 3 Then they kept coming to him and saying, “Hooray for the King of the Jews \f + \fr irony \f*!” and slapping him
\add on his face\add*. 
\p
\v 4 Once more Pilate came outside and said to the crowd, “Look! I am bringing him out to you so that you may know that I do
not find that he has done anything for which we should punish him
\add anymore\add*.” 
\v 5 When Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe, Pilate said to them, “Look at this
\add wretched\add* man!” 
\v 6 When the chief priests and Temple guards saw him, they shouted, “Command your soldiers to kill him by nailing him to a
cross! Crucify him!” Pilate, \add knowing that they could not legally do it
themselves\add*, said to them, “You yourselves take him and nail him to a cross! As for me, I do not find that he has done
anything for which we should punish him.” 
\v 7 The Jewish \add leaders\add* \f + \fr synecdoche \f* replied, “\add Our ancestor Moses gave
us\add* the law that says we must kill anyone \add who claims to be
God\add*. This man claims that he is ◄the Son of/the man who is also► God,
\add so you must have him killed\add* {\add command your soldiers to kill
him\add*}.” 
\v 8 When Pilate heard that, he was more afraid \add of what would happen to himself if he commanded the soldiers to kill
Jesus\add*. 
\v 9 So he \add took Jesus\add* back inside the headquarters. He said to Jesus, “Where do you
\add really\add* come from?” But Jesus did not answer him. 
\v 10 So Pilate said to him, “Are you refusing to answer me? Do you not know that I have authority to release you, and I
\add also\add* have authority to \add have\add* you crucified {command my soldiers to crucify you}?”
\v 11 Jesus replied, “The only authority you have is what has been given to you by God \f + \fr metonymy \f* {what God \f + \fr metonymy \f* has given you}.
The \add high priest\add* put me into your hands. \add He has done to me what he wanted to do, and you do not really want to do
it\add*. So he is guilty of committing a greater sin than you are.”
\p
\v 12 Because of that, Pilate kept trying to release Jesus. But the Jewish
\add leaders \add*\f + \fr synecdoche \f*, \add threatening to report to the Emperor that Pilate was not going to punish a man who claimed he was
a king\add*, continued to shout, “Anyone who claims that he is a king is opposing the Emperor! So if you release this man,
\add we will make sure that\add* the Emperor\add learns about it, and then he will not consider you
as\add* his friend!” 
\v 13 When Pilate heard that, he brought Jesus out again. He sat down at the place where he made decisions
\add about punishing people\add*. The place was called {People called it} The Stone Pavement. In the Aramaic language its name
was Gabbatha. 
\v 14 It was almost noontime, on the day that they prepared \add things
for\add* the Passover \add celebration\add* (OR, the day before the
\add Sabbath during\add* the Passover \add celebration\add*). 
\p Pilate said to the Jewish \add leaders\add* \f + \fr synecdoche \f*, \add ridiculing
them\add*, “Look at your king!” 
\v 15 They shouted, “Take him away! Take him away! \add Have\add* him crucified {Command your soldiers to nail him to a
cross}!” Pilate said to them, “\add He is\add* your king! Do you really want me to
\add tell my soldiers to\add* nail him to a cross?” The chief priests replied, “The Emperor is our king! We do not have any
other king!” 
\v 16 Then \add at last\add* Pilate agreed to do \add what they wanted, and he told the
soldiers\add* to crucify Jesus. 
\s John 19:16b-24 
\s They nailed Jesus to a cross. 
\p Then the soldiers took Jesus away. 
\v 17  \add As they left\add*, he himself was carrying the cross
\add on which they were going to nail him\add*. They went to a place called The Place of a Skull. In the Aramaic language it is
called {they call it} Golgotha. 
\v 18 There, \add after removing most of his clothes\add*, the soldiers nailed him to the cross. They also
\add nailed\add* two other \add criminals to crosses\add*. There was one on each side, and Jesus was in the middle.
\p
\v 19 Pilate also \add had them\add* write \add on a board\add* a notice
\add that stated why they were executing him\add*, and fasten it to the cross. But all they wrote was ‘Jesus from Nazareth, the
King of the Jews.’ 
\v 20 Many Jews were \add able to\add* read this sign, because the place where Jesus was nailed {where they nailed Jesus} to
the cross was very close to \add Jerusalem, where many people had come for the
celebration\add*, and because it was written {they wrote it} in three languages: Hebrew, Latin, and Greek.
\v 21 So the Jewish priests went back to Pilate and protested, saying to him, “Change what they have written from ‘The King of
the Jews’ to ‘This man said that he is the King of the Jews’!” 
\v 22 Pilate replied, “What I \add told them to\add* write is what they have written,
\add and I\add* will not\add change it\add*.” 
\q
\v 23 After the soldiers nailed Jesus to the cross, they took his clothes and divided them into four parts, one part for each
soldier. But they kept his cloak \add separate\add*. This cloak had been woven
\add from top to bottom\add* from one piece of cloth. 
\v 24 So they said to each other, “Let's not tear it. Instead, let's
\add decide\add* ◄\add by\add* throwing lots/\add by\add* gambling► who will get it.” So that is what the soldiers did. As a
result, these words were fulfilled {they fulfilled these words} that
\add the Psalmist had written\add* in Scripture, 
\q They divided \add most of\add* my clothes among themselves. 
\q They cast lots for \add one piece of\add* my clothing. 
\s John 19:25-27 
\s Jesus entrusted his mother to John's care. 
\p
\v 25 Near the cross where \add they had nailed\add* Jesus stood his mother, his mother's sister, Mary the
\add wife\add* of Clopas, and \add another\add* Mary, the woman from Magdala
\add village\add*. 
\v 26 Jesus saw his mother standing there. He also saw me standing nearby. Then he said to his mother, “This man
\add will now be like\add* your son.” 
\v 27 And he said to me, “\add Treat this\add* woman as \f + \fr metaphor \f* your mother.” So from that time I took her to my home
\add and took care of her\add*. 
\s John 19:28-37 
\s Jesus died. 
\p
\v 28 Later, Jesus knew that everything \add that God sent him to
do\add* had now been completed {that he had now completed everything
\add that God sent him to do\add*}, \add but he knew that something else that was written
in\add* the Scriptures \add had\add* to be fulfilled {\add that he
had\add* to fulfill \add something else that they had written in\add* the Scriptures}. So he said, “I am thirsty!”
\v 29 There was a jar of sour wine there. So \add someone took\add* a stalk of
\add a plant called\add* hyssop and \add fastened\add* a sponge \add to it.
Then\add* he dipped\add the sponge into the wine and\add* lifted it up to Jesus' lips.
\v 30 When Jesus tasted the sour wine, he shouted, “\add I\add* have finished
\add all that I came to do\add*!” Then he bowed his head and ◄died/handed over his spirit
\add to God\add*►. 
\p
\v 31 That was the day that they prepared \add everything for their\add*
◄\add Sabbath/day of rest\add*►. The next day was a special day of rest,
\add because it was the day of rest during the Passover celebration\add*. The Jewish
\add leaders\add* \f + \fr synecdoche \f* did not want the bodies \add of the three
men\add* to remain on the cross during their ◄Sabbath/day of rest►
\add because leaving bodies hanging overnight would be contrary to their Jewish
laws\add*. So they went to Pilate and asked him \add to command that\add* the legs
\add of the three men on the crosses\add* be broken {the \add soldiers\add* to break the legs
\add of the three men on the crosses\add*}, \add so that they would die
quickly\add*. Then their \add bodies\add* could be taken down \add and
buried\add* {someone could take down their bodies \add and bury them\add*}.
\v 32 So, \add after Pilate agreed\add*, the soldiers went and broke the legs of the first man whom they had nailed on a cross
near Jesus. Then they broke the legs of the second man. 
\v 33 But when they came to Jesus, they saw that he was dead already. So they did not break his legs.
\v 34 Instead, one of the soldiers pierced Jesus' side with a spear
\add to make sure that Jesus was dead\add*. Immediately blood \add clots\add* and
\add other\add* liquid flowed out, \add which showed that Jesus was really
dead\add*. 
\v 35 I, \add John\add*, saw this myself, and what I am writing is true. I
\add know that\add* I am telling the truth, and I am saying this in order that you may believe
\add in\add* (OR\add , my testimony about\add*) \add Jesus\add*.
\v 36 These things happened in order that these words would be fulfilled {to fulfill these words}
\add that are written in\add* Scripture: “Not one of his bones will be broken {No one will break any of his bones}.”
\p
\v 37 And \add they fulfilled\add* another Scripture passage \add that has these
words\add*: ‘They will look on the one whom they have pierced.’ 
\s John 19:38-42 
\s Joseph and others put Jesus' body in a cave. 
\p
\v 38 Later, Joseph, from Arimathea \add town, went to Pilate and\add* asked Pilate to
\add allow him\add* to take Jesus' body \add down from the cross\add*. Joseph was a disciple of Jesus, but he did not tell
anyone that, because he was afraid of the \add other\add* Jewish
\add leaders\add* \f + \fr synecdoche \f*. Pilate permitted him to take Jesus' body, so he went, along
\add with others\add*, and took Jesus' body \add down from the cross\add*.
\v 39 Nicodemus was one of them. He was the man who previously went to visit Jesus at night. Nicodemus bought an
\add expensive\add* mixture of myrrh and aloe \add spices to put on the
body\add*. It weighed about ◄75 pounds/35 kilograms►. 
\v 40 They took the body of Jesus and wrapped strips of linen cloth around it, putting the spices in with the strips of cloth.
They did this according to the Jewish customs \add about burying bodies in
tombs\add*. 
\v 41 Close to the place where Jesus was crucified {where they nailed Jesus to the cross} there was a grove
\add of trees\add*, and \add at the edge of\add* that grove was a new burial cave. Nobody had ever been put in that cave
\add previously\add*. 
\v 42 The Jewish day of rest would start\add at sunset, and they had to finish burying his body before
then\add*. So, since that cave was nearby, they laid Jesus' body there
\add and rolled a huge stone in front of the entrance\add*.
