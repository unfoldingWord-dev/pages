\c 4  
\s John 3:1-15 
\s Jesus told Nicodemus that people needed to be born again spiritually to have eternal life.
\p
\v 1-2  \add At that time, many people were asking\add* Jesus to baptize them. He did not baptize people; it was
\add we\add* his disciples who were doing the baptizing. But when some of the Pharisee
\add religious group\add* heard \add people say that\add* Jesus was making more disciples than John
\add the Baptizer\add* and was baptizing them, \add they became very
jealous\add*. 
\v 3 When the Lord \add Jesus\add* heard about that, \add so that the Pharisees would not cause trouble for
him\add*, he left Judea \add district\add*, and went again \add with us
disciples\add* to Galilee district. 
\p
\v 4  \add He\add* knew that God wanted him to travel through Samaria
\add district\add*. 
\v 5 So we arrived at a town named Sychar in Samaria \add district\add*. That was near the plot of ground that
\add our ancestor\add* Jacob had given to his son Joseph \add long
ago\add*. 
\v 6-8 The well that \add used to\add* belong to Jacob was on that plot of ground. Jesus was tired from walking. So while
\add we\add* disciples went into the town to buy some food, he sat down alongside the well. It was about noontime. A woman who
\add lived there\add* in Samaria came to get some water \add from the
well\add*. Jesus said to her, “Will you give me \add from the well\add* some water
\add to drink\add*?” The \add woman knew that\add* Jews did not like
◄\add to touch things that belong to\add* Samaritans/\add to\add* come near Samaritans►, \f + \ft (OR, Jews did not like to associate
with Samaritans,) 
\v 9 so the woman said to him, “You are a Jew, and I am from Samaria. Furthermore, I am a woman. So
◄\add I am surprised\add* that you are asking me for a drink \add of
water\add*!/how is it that you are asking me for a drink \add of
water\add*?► \f + \fk rhetorical question \f*” 
\v 10 Jesus replied to her, “If you\add (sg)\add* knew what God \add wanted
to\add* give you, and if you knew who I am, the one who is asking you for a drink, you would have asked me, and I would have
given you water that gives life.” 
\v 11 She \add thought he was talking about\add* ordinary \add water. So
she\add* said to him, “Sir, you do not have a bucket \add or a rope with which to get water from the
well\add*, and the well is deep. So\add since you cannot get water from this
well\add*, where can you get that life-giving water? 
\v 12 Our ancestor Jacob left us this well. He drank water from it, and there was
\add enough good water\add* so that his sons and his flocks \add of
sheep\add* and goats drank from it also. \add Do you claim that\add* you are greater than Jacob,
\add and because of that you can give us life-giving water\add*?”
\v 13 Jesus replied to her, “Everyone who drinks water from this
\add well\add* will later become thirsty again. 
\v 14 But those who drink the water that I will give them will never be thirsty again. On the contrary, the water that I give
them will become in their inner beings like a spring of water that will enable them to have eternal life.”
\v 15 The woman \add did not understand that Jesus was speaking figuratively about something that would sustain her
spiritually. So she\add* said to him, “Sir, give me that kind of water so that I will not get thirsty again, and so that I will
not have to keep returning here to get water!” 
\p
\v 16  \add Jesus knew that she did not understand, but he wanted to show her by his God-given knowledge of her personal life
that because he was the Messiah he could supply her spiritual need.
So\add* he said to her, “Woman, go and call your husband, and bring him here!”
\v 17 She replied, “I do not have a husband!” Jesus said to her, “You said that you do not have a husband, and that is true.
\v 18 It is also true that you have had five husbands \add one by
one\add*. And the man you are living with now is not your husband! What you have said is very true.”
\p
\v 19 The woman said to him, “Sir, I perceive you must be a prophet
\add because you are\add* able \add to know people's secrets\add*.
\v 20 But \add let me ask you a different question\add*: Our ancestors worshipped God here on
\add Gerizim mountain\add*, but you \add Jews\add* say that Jerusalem is the place where we must worship
\add God. So who is right\add*?” 
\v 21 Jesus said to her, “Woman, believe me \add when I say that\add* there will be a time when it will not
\add matter whether\add* you worship \add God our\add* Father on this mountain or in Jerusalem
\add or somewhere else\add*. 
\v 22 You \add people from Samaria\add* do not know the one you are worshipping. But
we\add (exc) Jews\add* know whom we worship, because it is from \add us\add* Jews that
\add God has sent the one who\add* will save people \add from the guilt of their
sins\add*. 
\v 23 However, there will be a time when those who genuinely worship God will worship him as
\add God's\add* Spirit \add directs\add* and according to \add God's\add* truth. In fact, that time is now. Those are the kind
of worshipers my Father seeks. 
\v 24 God is a spiritual being. So it is necessary that those who worship him must worship him as his Spirit
\add directs\add* and \add according to God's\add* truth.” 
\v 25 The woman said to him, “I know that the Messiah is coming. When he comes, he will tell us everything
\add we need to know\add*.” (‘Messiah’ and ‘Christ’ \add both mean ‘God's promised
king\add*’.) 
\v 26 Jesus said to her, “I, the one speaking to you, am \add the
Messiah\add*!” 
\p
\v 27 Just then \add we\add* disciples returned \add from town\add*.
\add Since it was contrary to our custom for Jewish religious teachers to converse with a woman they did not
know\add*, we were surprised that he was talking to a woman. However, none of us asked her, “What do you want?” and none of us
asked him, “Why are you talking with her?” 
\p
\v 28 The woman left her water jar there and went into the town. She said to the people there,
\v 29 “Come and see a man who \add was able to\add* tell me all about my past life \f + \fk hyperbole \f*,
\add even though I never met him before\add*! Could this man be the Messiah?”
\v 30 So \add many people\add* left the town and started going where Jesus was.
\s John 4:31-38 
\s Jesus told his disciples that what sustained him was doing his Father's will, which meant convincing non-Jewish people to
believe in him. 
\p
\v 31 Meanwhile, we disciples were urging him, “Teacher, eat \add some of the food we
brought\add*!” 
\v 32 But he said to us, “I have food to eat that you do not know anything about!”
\v 33 So we started saying to each other, “◄Surely no one has brought him any food
\add when we\add* were not \add here\add*!/Has anyone brought him any food
\add when we\add* were not\add here\add*?► \f + \fk rhetorical question \f*” 
\v 34 Jesus said to us, “Doing what \add my Father\add* who sent me wants
\add me to do\add* and finishing the work he \add gave me to do\add* is
◄\add what sustains me/like\add* my food► \f + \fk metaphor \f*. 
\v 35  \add At this time of the year\add* you are saying (OR, your ancestors used to say) \f*, ‘There are four months left before
we harvest \add the crops\add*.’ But I say to you, look carefully
\add at the non-Jewish people around here. God says, ‘They are ready to accept my
message\add* \f + \fk metaphor \f*, \add like crops in\add* fields that are ready for people to harvest.
\v 36  \add If you enable them to accept my message\add*, I will reward you \f + \fk metaphor \f*,
\add as an owner of a field\add* pays those who harvest the crops. Because of your work, people will gain eternal life.’
\add I have been telling people God's message. That is like\add* \f + \fk metaphor \f* a man who plants seeds.
\add You will help people to accept my message. That will be like\add* \f + \fk metaphor \f* harvesting crops.
\add When that happens\add*, both you and I will rejoice. 
\v 37 As a result, this saying will become true: One person plants
\add seeds\add*, but others harvest \add the crops\add*. 
\v 38 I am sending you \add to enable people to accept my message, but you will not be the first ones who tell them God's
message\add*. Others \add previously\add* worked hard \add to tell people God's
message\add*, and now you will be harvesting the results of their work.”
\s John 4:39-42 
\s Many Samaritans believed that Jesus was the Messiah. 
\p
\v 39 Many of the Samaria \add district\add* people who \add lived\add* in that town believed that Jesus
\add was the Messiah\add* because they heard what that woman said
\add about Jesus\add*, “That man \add was able to\add* tell me all about my past life \f + \fk hyperbole \f*!”
\v 40 So when those people of Samaria came to him, they urged him to stay with them. So we stayed there two days.
\v 41 Many more of them believed ◄\add in Jesus/that he was the Messiah\add*► because of his message.
\v 42 They told the woman, “We believe in Jesus \add now\add*, but not
\add just\add* because of what you told us. Now we have heard \add his
message\add* ourselves. And now we know that this man truly is the one who
\add can\add* save the \add people in the\add* world \f + \fk metonymy \f* \add from the guilt of their
sins\add*.” 
\s John 4:43-54 
\s After Jesus healed an official's son, the official and his family believed that Jesus is the Messiah.
\p
\v 43-44 Jesus had said \add previously\add* that people did not honor prophets
\add like himself when they tried to teach people\add* in their own home area. So, two days later, Jesus and
\add we\add* disciples left that area and went to \add his own area
in\add* Galilee \add district, because he knew that people there would not think very highly of him, and as a result the Jewish
leaders would not be jealous\add*. 
\v 45 However, when we arrived in Galilee \add district, many\add* of the people there welcomed him, because they had been in
Jerusalem during the \add Passover\add* celebration and had seen all the things he did there.
\v 46 Jesus went again to Cana \add town\add* in Galilee \add district\add*. That was where he
\add previously\add* turned water into wine. There was one of the king's officials who lived in Capernaum
\add city\add*, whose son was very sick. 
\v 47 When that man heard \add others say\add* that Jesus had returned to Galilee
\add district\add* from Judea \add district\add*, he went to Jesus
\add in Cana\add* and pleaded with him, “Please come down \add to
Capernaum\add* and heal my son, who is about to die!” 
\v 48 Jesus said to him, “You people will believe my message only if you see me perform
\add more\add* miracles!” 
\v 49 But the official said to him, “Sir, ◄\add I\add* believe \add in you/I believe that you came from
God\add*►. \add So please\add* come down \add to my home\add* before my son dies!”
\v 50 Jesus said to him, “Then you may go \add home\add*. Your son ◄will live/not die►!” The man believed what Jesus said, and
left. 
\v 51  \add The next day\add* while he was on the way home, his servants met him. They told him, “Your child is going to live!”
\v 52 He asked them, “At what time did my son start to become well?” They said to him, “His fever ceased yesterday
\add afternoon\add* at one o'clock.” 
\v 53 Then the boy's father realized that this was the time Jesus told him, “Your son will ◄live/not die►.” So he and all the
people in his house believed \add that Jesus was the Messiah\add*.
\p
\v 54 That was the second miracle that Jesus performed in Galilee
\add district\add*, after he had returned from Judea \add district\add*.
