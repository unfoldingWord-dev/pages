\c 8  
\s John 8:1-11 
\s Jesus evaded a trap about condemning a woman who had been caught committing adultery.
\p
\v 1 But Jesus went \add with us disciples\add* to Olive \add Tree\add* Hill
\add and we stayed near there that night\add*. 
\v 2 Early the next morning, we returned to the Temple \add courtyard\add*. Many people gathered around him, so he sat down to
teach them. 
\v 3 Then men who taught the \add Jewish\add* laws and some of \f + \fr synecdoche \f* the Pharisee
\add religious group\add* brought a woman to him. She was seized
{\add They\add* had \add arranged to\add* seize her} while she was having sex with a man who was not her husband. They made her
stand up in front of the group \add that was listening to Jesus\add*.
\v 4 Then they said to Jesus, “Teacher, this woman was seized {\add we\add* seized this woman} while she was having sex with a
man who is not her husband. 
\v 5 Moses commanded us in the laws that \add he gave us\add* that we should throw stones at such women
\add and kill them\add*. So what do you say \add we should do\add*?”
\v 6 They asked this question as a trap so that they could accuse him.
\add If he said that they should not kill her, they would shame him for disobeying the law of Moses. If he said that they
should kill her, they could accuse him to the Roman governor\add*.
\p But Jesus bent down and wrote something on the ground with his finger.
\v 7 While they continued to question him, he stood up and said to them, “Whichever one of you has never sinned can be the
first one to start throwing stones at her.” 
\v 8 Then he stooped down and wrote \add some more\add* on the ground.
\v 9 After they heard what he said, those \add who were questioning
him\add* went away, one by one, the older ones first \add and then the younger ones, knowing they were all
sinners\add*. Finally only Jesus was there, along with the woman.
\v 10 Jesus stood up and asked her, “Woman, where are they? Has no one said you must die for your sin?”
\v 11 She said, “No, sir, no one.” Then Jesus said, “I do not condemn you either. Go
\add home\add* now, and do not continue your sinful \add life\add* any longer!”]
\s John 8:12-20 
\s Jesus replied to the Pharisees' objection to his claim to be like a light for the people of the world.
\p
\v 12 Jesus spoke to the people again. He said, “I am \add like\add* a light \f + \fr metaphor \f* for
\add all the people in\add* \f + \fr metonymy \f* the world. \add Just like a light reveals what has been in the
darkness\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f*, \add I reveal God's truth to them\add*. Those who walk in the darkness
\add are unaware of what is around them\add*. But those who become my disciples will always be aware
\add of God's truth\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f*. They will have my light \add which shows them how to have
eternal\add* life.” 
\v 13 So the Pharisees said to him, “You are just telling about yourself!
\add Since there is no one else to verify these things that you say about
yourself\add*, \add we\add* do not \add need to accept that\add* what you say is true.”
\v 14 Jesus replied, “Even if I were the \add only one to\add* say these things about myself, what I say is true, because I
know that I came from \add heaven\add*, and I know that I am going
\add back to heaven\add*. But \bd you\bd* do not know where I came from or where I am going.
\v 15  \bd You\bd* judge people according to human standards. \add The
reason\add* that \bd I\bd* am \add here is\add* not ◄to condemn people/to say that I will punish people►
\add for their sins\add*. 
\v 16 But if I did judge \add people\add*, what I decided would be correct, because I am not the
\add only\add* one \add who will decide those things\add*. I and the one who sent me will both decide.
\v 17 It is written {\add Moses\add* wrote} in your law that if \add at
least\add* two people testify that \add some event has happened\add*,
\add people should consider\add* that what they say is true. 
\v 18 I am telling you about myself, and the other one who is telling you about me is
\add my\add* Father who sent me. \add So you should believe that what we declare is
true\add*.” 
\p
\v 19 Then they asked him, “\add If you have a\add* father whom \add we can question about
you\add*, where is he?” Jesus replied, “You do not know \add who\add* I
\add really am\add*. If you knew who I \add really am\add*, you would know who my Father is also.”
\v 20 He said these things when he was in the Temple \add courtyard\add*, near the place where the people put their offerings.
\add This was also very close to the place where the Jewish council
met\add*. But no one seized him to arrest him, because it was not yet time \f + \fr metonymy \f*
\add for him to suffer and die\add*. 
\s John 8:21-30 
\s Jesus replied to the Pharisees' continued rejection of Jesus' claims about himself.
\p
\v 21 Jesus also said to them, “I \add will soon be\add* going away. Then
\add at the end of your life\add* you will seek me, but you will die
\add without God forgiving\add* your sins. Where I will go, you will not be able to come.”
\v 22 So the Jewish \add leaders\add* said among themselves, “Is he going to kill himself? Is that the reason that he said,
‘Where I go, you will not be able to come’?” 
\v 23 But Jesus continued by saying to them, “You were born here in this world, but I came from heaven. You belong to those who
are opposed to God \f + \fr metonymy \f*. I do not belong to them. 
\v 24 I told you that you will die \add without God forgiving\add* your sins. If you do not believe that I am
\add who I say that I am\add*, you will die \add without God forgiving\add* your sins.”
\p
\v 25 So they said to him, “You! Who do you think you are?” Jesus said to them, “Ever since I
began\add teaching\add*, I have been telling you who I am! 
\v 26 I could judge you and say that \add you are guilty of\add* many things. But instead,
\add I will say only\add* what the one who sent me tells me to say.
\add What he says\add* is true, and I tell the people in the world \f + \fr metonymy \f* what I have heard from him.”
\p
\v 27 They did not understand that he was talking about his Father
\add in heaven\add*. 
\v 28 So Jesus said, “I am the one who came down from heaven, but when you lift me up
\add on a cross to kill me\add*, you will know who I am. You will also know that I do not do anything with my own
\add authority\add*. Instead, I say just what \add my\add* Father has taught me.
\v 29 He is the one who sent me, and he helps me. Because I always do the things that please him, he has never abandoned me.”
\v 30 As Jesus was saying these things, many people believed that he
\add was\add* ◄\add from God/the Messiah\add*►. 
\s John 8:31-59 
\s Jesus told his critics which people were true believers like Abraham and which ones really were serving Satan.
\p
\v 31 Then Jesus said to the Jews who now said they believed in him, “If you continue to
\add live in accordance with\add* my message, you will truly be my disciples.
\v 32 Then you will know \add God's\add* truth, and as a result of
\add your believing his\add* truth, he \f + \fr personification \f* will free you \add from being controlled by the one who has made you his
slaves\add*.” 
\v 33 They replied to him, “We are descendants of Abraham. We have never been anyone's slaves. So why do you say
\add we will\add* be freed \add from being someone's slaves\add*?”
\v 34 Jesus replied, “Listen carefully to what I am going to tell you. All those who continue to sin are
\add forced to obey\add* their sinful desires \f + \fr metaphor \f*, \add just like\add* a slave
\add is forced to obey his master\add*. 
\v 35 A slave is not a permanent member of a family. But a son is a member of a family forever.
\add Similarly, you say you are members of God's family because you are descendants of Abraham, but really, because you are
like slaves of your sinful desires, you are no longer permanent members of God's
family\add*. 
\v 36 So if you allow me to free you, you will truly be free. 
\v 37 I know that you are Abraham's descendants. But you are trying to kill me because
\add you are not\add* allowing \f + \fr personification \f* my message to continue \add to
change\add* your inner being. 
\v 38 I am telling you what I saw when I was with \add my\add* Father. But you do the things that you have heard from your
father.” 
\p
\v 39 They replied to him, “Abraham is our ancestor.” Jesus said to them, “If you were Abraham's descendants,
\add your character would be like Abraham's character, and\add* you would do
\add good\add* things like Abraham did. 
\v 40 I have been telling you the truth that I heard from God, but you are trying to kill me. Abraham did not do things like
that. 
\v 41 No! You are doing the things that your \add real\add* father does.”
\p They said to him, “\add We do not know about you, but\add* we are not illegitimate children. And
\add spiritually\add*, we have only one Father. That is God, and you do not know who your father is!”
\v 42 Jesus said to them, “If God were your father, you would love me, because I came from God, and now I have come here
\add to this world\add*. My coming was not ◄because I \add appointed\add* myself/with my own
\add authority\add*►. He sent me. 
\v 43 ◄And I will tell you why you do not understand what I say./Do you know why you do not understand what I say?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* It is
because you do not want to accept my message. 
\v 44 You belong to your father, ◄the devil/Satan►, and you desire to do what he wants. He has
\add caused people to become\add* murderers from the time when \add people\add* first
\add sinned\add*. He has abandoned \add God's\add* truth because he is a liar by his nature. Whenever he lies, he is speaking
according to his \add nature\add*, because he is a liar and is the one who originates \f + \fr metaphor \f* all lies.
\v 45 But because I tell you the truth, you do not believe me! 
\v 46  \add Since I have never sinned\add*, ◄none of you can show that I have sinned./can anyone among you show that I have
sinned?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* So, since I tell you the truth, ◄there is no good reason for your not believing me!/why is it that you do not
believe me?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* 
\v 47 Those who belong to God habitually obey God's message. You do not belong to God, so you do not obey his message.”
\p
\v 48 The Jewish \add leaders\add* \f + \fr synecdoche \f* replied to him, “◄We are certainly right by saying that you
\add believe what is false as\add* the Samaritans \add do\add*!/Are we not right by saying that you
\add believe what is false as\add* the Samaritans \add do\add*?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* And that ◄a demon/an evil spirit►
\add controls\add* you!” 
\v 49 Jesus replied, “A demon does not \add control\add* me! I honor my Father, and you do not honor me!
\v 50 I am not trying to honor myself. There is someone else who desires
\add to honor me\add*, and he is the one who will judge \add whether it is I who am telling the truth or whether it is you who
are telling the truth\add*. 
\v 51 But the truth is that anyone who obeys what I say will never die!”
\p
\v 52 Then the Jewish \add leaders\add* \f + \fr synecdoche \f*, \add thinking that he was talking about ordinary death and not about spiritual
death\add*, said to him, “Now we are sure that a demon \add controls\add* you! Abraham and the prophets died
\add long ago!\add* But you say that anyone who obeys what you teach will never die!
\v 53 ◄You are certainly not greater than our ancestor Abraham!/Do you think you are greater than our ancestor Abraham?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*
He died, and all the prophets died, so who do you think you are \add by saying something like
that\add*?” 
\v 54 Jesus replied, “If I were honoring myself, that would be worthless. My Father is the one who you say is your God. He is
the one who honors me. 
\v 55 Although you do not know him, I know him \add and have a close relationship with
him\add*. If I said that I did not know him, I would be a liar like you are. But I know him, and I obey what he says.
\v 56 Your ancestor Abraham was happy when he thought about what I would
\add do during\add* my life \f + \fr metonymy \f*. \add It was as though\add* he saw that, and was happy.”
\p
\v 57 Then the Jewish \add leaders\add* \f + \fr synecdoche \f* said to him, “You are not fifty years old yet! So ◄you certainly did not see
him!/how could you have seen him?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*” \add Because he died long
ago\add*!” 
\v 58 Jesus said to them, “The truth is that I existed before Abraham was born!”
\v 59 So, \add because they were very angry about Jesus thus saying that
he\add* ◄\add had eternally existed/was equal with God\add*►, they picked up stones to throw at him
\add to kill him\add*. But \add Jesus\add* caused them not to be able to see him, and he left the Temple courtyard.
