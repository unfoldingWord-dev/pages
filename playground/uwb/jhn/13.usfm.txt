\c 13  
\s John 12:1-8 
\s Lazarus' older sister, Mary, poured perfume on Jesus' feet. 
\p
\v 1 When it was the evening before the Passover celebration, Jesus knew that it was time for him to leave this world and
\add to return\add* to \add his\add* Father \add in heaven\add*. He loved us who
\add were his disciples\add*. He knew \add we would continue to live
here\add* in this world, so now he \add showed us\add* how completely he loved us.
\v 2 We were eating \add the Passover meal\add*. ◄The devil/Satan► had already suggested to Judas ◄Iscariot/the man from
Kerioth \add village\add*►, the son of Simon, that he should ◄betray Jesus/enable Jesus' enemies to seize him►.
\v 3 But Jesus knew that his Father had given to him complete authority
\add to control the situation\add*. He knew that he had come from God and would soon return to God.
\v 4  \add But before he left us, he wanted to show us how we should love each
other\add*. \add So\add* he got up from where he was eating. He took off his
\add outer\add* cloak and wrapped a \add long\add* towel around his waist,
\add as a slave would do\add*. 
\v 5 Then he poured some water in a basin. He began to wash our feet, and then dry them with the towel that he had wrapped
around himself. 
\p
\v 6 When he came to Simon Peter, Peter said to him, “Lord, it is not right for you \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* to
\add humble yourself by\add* washing my feet!” 
\v 7 Jesus replied to him, “Now you do not understand \add the meaning
of\add* what I am doing, but you will understand later.” 
\v 8 Peter said, “I will never, ever, \add allow you to\add* wash my feet!” Jesus replied to him, “If I do not wash you, you
cannot continue ◄to be my \add disciple/to belong to\add* me►.” 
\v 9 So Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, \add in that case\add*, do not wash only my feet. Wash my hands and my head,
\add too\add*!” 
\v 10  \add Then, to show him that after God had cleansed people from being guilty for sin, they needed only for God to forgive
their daily sins\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f*, Jesus said to him, “Those who have recently bathed need only to have their feet washed,
\add because they get dirty very quickly on the dusty roads\add*. The
\add rest of their bodies are\add* clean. Similarly, I have made you
\add disciples\add* free/clean \add from the guilt of your sins\add*, although not all of you are free from guilt.”
\v 11 He knew which one \add of us\add* was going to betray him. That is the reason he said, “Not all of you are free from
guilt.” 
\p
\v 12 After he finished washing our feet, he put his cloak back on. Then he sat down and said to us, “Do you understand what I
have done for you? 
\v 13 You \add show that you respect me by\add* calling me ‘Teacher’ and ‘Lord’. You are right to say that, because I am your
teacher and your Lord. 
\v 14 But if I, who am your teacher and your Lord, have washed your feet, you ought to
\add serve each other by doing things like\add* washing each other's feet.
\v 15 I have made myself an example for you in order that you should
\add humbly serve each other\add* as I have done for you. 
\v 16 Listen to this carefully: A servant is not greater than his master. A messenger is not greater than the one who has sent
him. \add So, since you are not greater than I am, you should not be proud and unwilling to serve each
other\add*. 
\v 17 Since you now know these things, \add God will\add* be pleased with you if you do them.”
\s John 13:18-30 
\s Jesus predicted that one of them would betray him to his enemies.
\p
\v 18 “I am not saying that \add God will bless\add* all of you. I knew
\add what all of you were like when\add* I chose you. But \add I also chose the one who will betray
me\add*, in order that what is written in Scripture might be fulfilled {to fulfill what someone/the psalmist wrote in
Scripture}, ‘The one who is \add acting like he is my friend by\add* eating with me has become my enemy \f + \fr idiom \f*.’
\p
\v 19 I am telling you \add about someone betraying me\add* before it happens, in order that when it happens, you may continue
to believe that I am ◄\add the Messiah/who I say I am\add*►. 
\v 20 Listen to this carefully: Those who accept any one of you whom I am sending out,
\add God will consider that\add* they are accepting me. And those who accept me,
\add God will consider that\add* they are accepting \add my Father\add*, who sent me.”
\p
\v 21 After Jesus said this, he was very troubled within himself. He solemnly declared, “Listen to this carefully: One of you
is going to enable \add my enemies\add* to seize me.” 
\v 22 We looked at each other. We had no way \add to know\add* whom he was talking about.
\v 23  \add I\add*, the \add man other people call\add* ‘the one Jesus loved’, was sitting very close to Jesus.
\v 24 Simon Peter motioned to me to indicate that I should ask Jesus whom he was talking about.
\v 25 So I leaned close to Jesus and asked him, “Lord, who is it?”
\v 26 Jesus answered, “It is the one to whom I will give this piece of bread after I dip it
\add in the sauce in the dish\add*.” Then, \add to show us that he knew who would enable his enemies to seize
him\add*, after he dipped the bread \add in the sauce\add*, he gave it to Judas ◄Iscariot/the man from Kerioth
\add village\add*►. 
\v 27 As soon as \add Judas ate\add* the bread, Satan took control of him. Then Jesus said to him, “What you are going to do,
do quickly.” 
\v 28 But none of the rest of us who were sitting there knew why Jesus said that to him.
\v 29 Since Judas took care of the money \add people gave us to help
us\add*, some thought Jesus was telling him to \add go and\add* buy some things we needed for the
\add Passover\add* celebration. \add Some thought he was telling
him\add* to give some money to poor people. 
\v 30 As soon as Judas had eaten the bread, he left. It was dark
\add outside\add*, and it was dark \f + \fr metaphor \f* \add in his soul, too\add*.
\s John 13:31-35 
\s Jesus commanded his disciples that they should love each other.
\p
\v 31 After Judas left, Jesus said, “Now it will be shown {\add my
Father\add* will show} how wonderful I, the one who came from heaven, am. And by what I do it will be seen {people will see}
how great God is. 
\v 32 Since by what I do people will see how awesome God is, God himself will show people how awesome I am. And he will do that
very soon. 
\p
\v 33  \add You whom I love as though you were\add* my children, I will continue with you only a short time longer. Then you
will look for me, but I will not be here. Just like I told the Jewish
\add leaders\add* \f + \fr synecdoche \f*, I am telling you now, that where I am going, you cannot come
\add yet\add*. 
\v 34 Now I am giving you a new commandment: you must love each other. You must love each other in the way that I have loved
you. 
\v 35 If you keep loving each other, everyone \add who is aware of
that\add* \f + \fr hyperbole \f* will know that you are my disciples.” 
\s John 13:36-38 
\s Jesus also prophesied that Peter would deny that he knew Jesus.
\p
\v 36 Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, where are you going?” Jesus replied, “The place where I am going, you cannot come with me
now, but you will come there later.” 
\v 37 Peter said, “Lord, why can I not come with you now? I \add am
ready\add* to die for you!” 
\v 38 Jesus answered, “\add You say\add* \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* that you \add are
ready\add* to die for me. But the truth is that before the rooster crows
\add early tomorrow morning\add*, you will say three times that you do not
\add know\add* me!”
