\c 3  
\p
\v 1 There was a man named Nicodemus, who was a member of the Jewish religious council. He belonged to the Pharisee
\add religious sect\add*. 
\v 2 He went to see Jesus at night, \add to talk to him about God's
kingdom\add*. He said to Jesus, “Teacher, \add we believe that\add* you are a teacher who has come from God.
\add We believe this because\add* we know that someone could perform the miracles you are doing only if God were helping him.”
\v 3 Jesus replied to him, “Listen to this carefully: Unless people are born again and
\add have a new life from God\add*, they cannot even see the place where God rules \f + \fk metaphor \f*!”
\v 4 Then Nicodemus said to him, “◄No one can be born when he is old!/How can anyone be born when he is old?► \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* ◄There is
no way he can enter his mother's womb and be born a second time!/How can he enter his mother's womb and be born a second time?►
\f + \fk rhetorical question \f*” 
\v 5 Jesus answered, “Note this: Being born naturally is not \add enough\add*; people need to also be born
\add spiritually\add* by God's Spirit. If that does not happen, they cannot experience God ruling \f + \fk metaphor \f*
\add their lives\add*. 
\v 6 If someone is born as a result of what humans \add do\add*, that person becomes a human being. But those who are born
\add again\add* as a result of what \add God's\add* Spirit \add does receive a
new\add* spiritual \add nature from God\add*. 
\v 7 Do not be surprised about my telling you that you must be born again
\add and have a new life from God\add*. 
\v 8  \add Let me illustrate\add*: The wind blows wherever it wants to blow. You hear its sound, but you do not know where the
wind comes from or where it is going. Similarly, those \add who do not know God cannot
understand/control/predict\add* how people are born again as a result of what God's spirit
\add does\add*.” 
\v 9 Nicodemus replied to him, “How can that happen?” 
\v 10 Jesus replied to him, “You\add (sg)\add* are a \add well-known\add* teacher among
\add us\add* Israelite people, so ◄I am surprised that you do not understand these things!/how is it that you do not understand
these things?► \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* 
\v 11 Listen to this carefully: ◄My disciples and I/I► tell you\add (pl)\add* about the things that my disciples and I have
seen and know \add are true\add*, but you\add (pl)\add* do not admit that what my disciples and I are saying
\add is true\add*. 
\v 12 I have told you about the things \add that happen here\add* on earth that are true, but
you\add (pl)\add* do not believe me. So if I tell you\add (sg)\add* about things
\add that happen\add* in heaven, ◄you certainly will not believe me!/how will you believe me?► \f + \fk rhetorical question \f*
\v 13 I am the only one who has gone up to heaven; no one else has gone up there. I am also the one who came down from heaven.
\add So I know what happens there\add*. 
\v 14  \add Long ago when the Israelite people rebelled against God\add* in the desolate area,
\add God sent poisonous snakes to bite them\add*. But when Moses lifted up
\add on a pole\add* the \add model of a\add* poisonous snake, \add everyone who looked at that model was healed from their
snake bites\add*. Similarly, \add even though I\add* am the one who came from heaven,
\add some day people\add* will lift me up \add on a cross to kill
me\add*. 
\v 15 As a result, everyone who believes/trusts in me will have eternal life.”
\s John 3:16-21 
\s God sent his Son into the world to save everyone who trusts in him.
\p
\v 16 God loved us people \f + \fk metonymy \f* in the world so much that he gave his only Son
\add as a sacrifice for us\add*, in order that everyone who believes in him would not be separated from God forever. Instead,
they would have eternal life. 
\v 17 When God sent his Son into the world, his purpose was not to punish the
\add people in\add* \f + \fk metonymy \f* the world for their sins. Instead, he sent him in order that they might be saved by him {he might
save them} \add from being\add* ◄\add guilty/punished\add*► \add for their
sins\add*. 
\v 18 Everyone who trusts in his Son, \add God says that they\add* will not be punished {that he will not punish them}. But God
has already \add said that\add* everyone who does not trust in his Son will be punished {that he will punish everyone who does
not trust in his Son}, because they have not trusted in what his only Son
\add has done for them\add*. 
\v 19 The \add one who was like a\add* light \f + \fk metaphor \f* \add to reveal God's truth to
us\add* came into the world. But people loved doing what was \add evil,
like\add* darkness \f + \fk metaphor \f* \add is evil\add*, instead of loving the
\add one who was like a\add* light. That is the reason \add God will\add* judge people
\add and condemn them\add*. 
\v 20 Everyone who does what is evil hates the \add one who is like
a\add* light, and they will not come to the \add one who is like
a\add* light, because it would be shown {\add the one who is like a
light\add* would show} that their deeds \add are evil, and he would rebuke
them\add*. 
\v 21 But those who live according to \add God's\add* truth come to the
\add one who is like a\add* light, in order that it may be seen clearly {that people may see clearly} that the things they have
done they did them because \add they have depended\add* on God. 
\s John 3:22-36 
\s When many people began to become Jesus' disciples, and John the Baptizer declared that Jesus was greater then he, the Jewish
leaders rejected John's and Jesus' testimony that Jesus was equal to God.
\p
\v 22 Some time later Jesus and we disciples went to Judea district. He stayed with us there and
\add directed us as we\add* baptized people. 
\p
\v 23 John \add the Baptizer\add* was also baptizing people. He was doing that at Aenon
\add village\add* near Salim \add town in Samaria district\add*, because there were many springs in that area.
\add Many\add* people kept coming \add to John\add* and were being baptized {he was baptizing them}.
\v 24 That happened before John was put {they put John} in prison.
\v 25 Then some of John's disciples and a certain Jew started arguing about the Jewish rituals of washing things
\add to make them acceptable to God\add*. 
\v 26 Then those disciples went to John and said to him, “Teacher,
\add do you remember\add* the man who was with you when you were baptizing people on the other side of the Jordan River? He is
the one you were telling us about. Well, now he is baptizing people, and many people are going to him
\add instead of coming to us\add*!” 
\v 27 John replied, “A person can become \add important\add* only if God \f + \fk metonymy \f* permits it.
\add So\add* we\add should not be jealous about Jesus being popular\add*!
\v 28 You yourselves can verify what I said. I told you that I am not ◄the Messiah/God's promised king►. Instead, I
\add told you that\add* I was sent {that \add God\add* sent me} to prepare the way for him.
\v 29  \add Let me illustrate\add* \f + \fk metaphor \f*: \add He is like a\add*
◄\add bridegroom/man who is being married\add*►, \add and I am like his
friend\add*. The friend of the bridegroom stands there and waits
\add for him to come\add*. That friend is very happy when he hears the bridegroom's voice
\add when he arrives\add*. Similarly, I am very happy \add about what you have told
me\add*. 
\v 30 It is necessary for Jesus to become more important \add by making more disciples than I
have\add*, and for me to become less \add important\add*.” 
\p
\v 31  \add Jesus\add* came from heaven. He is more important than anyone else. Those who are born from
\add parents here\add* on earth \f + \fk metonymy \f* are just humans, and they speak about things
\add that happen here\add* on the earth. But since he came from heaven, his
\add words are\add* more important than anyone else's. 
\v 32 He tells people what he has seen and what he heard \add in
heaven\add*, but very few people \f + \fk hyperbole \f* listen to what he says. 
\v 33 Those who have accepted what he has said verify that what God has said is true.
\v 34  \add We know it is true\add* because\add Jesus\add*, the one God sent, speaks the message of God.
\add That is also true\add* because God causes his Spirit to live
\add in Jesus\add* to completely \add direct everything he says and
does\add*. 
\v 35 God loves his Son, and has caused him to have control/power over everything.
\v 36 Those who trust in \add God's\add* Son have eternal life. But those who reject God's Son will never have
\add eternal\add* life. Instead, God is angry with them \add and he will surely punish
them\add*. 
\s John 4:1-30 
\s While Jesus talked with a Samaritan woman, he showed by his God-given knowledge of her personal life that he is the
life-giving Messiah.
