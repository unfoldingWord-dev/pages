\c 17  
\s John 17:1-5 
\s Jesus prayed that God would honor him. 
\p
\v 1 After Jesus said those things, he looked \add up\add* toward heaven. Then he prayed,
"\add My\add* Father, it is now the time \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add for me to suffer and
die\add*. Honor me \add as I do that\add*, in order that I may honor you.
\v 2 You gave me authority over all people, in order that I might enable all those whom you chose
\add to come\add* to me to live eternally. 
\v 3  \add The way for people\add* to live eternally is for them to know that you are the only true God, and to know that
\add I\add*, Jesus, am the Messiah, the one you have sent. 
\v 4 I have honored you here on this earth by completing all the work that you gave me to do.
\v 5  \add My\add* Father, now honor me when I am with you \add again\add*, by causing me to have the greatness I had when I
was with you before the world began." 
\s John 17:6-19 
\s Jesus prayed that God would protect his disciples. 
\p
\v 6 "I have revealed \add what\add* you \add are like\add* to the people whom you brought to me from among those who do not
belong to you \f + \ft metonymy \f*. Those \add who came to me\add* belonged to you, and you brought them to me. Now they have obeyed your
message. 
\v 7 Now they know that everything you have given me, \add your message and your
work\add*, comes from you. 
\v 8 I gave them the message that you gave me, and they have accepted it. They now know for certain that I came from you. They
now believe that you sent me. 
\v 9 I am praying for them. I am not praying for those \add who do not belong to
you\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*. Instead, \add I am praying\add* for those whom you have brought to me, because they belong to you.
\v 10 All \add the disciples\add* that I have belong to you, and all those who belong to you also belong to me. They have shown
how great I am. 
\v 11 I will not be \add staying\add* in the world any longer. I will be coming back to you. They, however, will be
\add here\add* in the world \add among those who are opposed to you\add*.
\add My\add* Holy Father, protect them from spiritual harm by your power \f + \ft metonymy \f*, the power that you gave me, in order that they
may be united as we are united. 
\v 12 While I have been with them, I have \add completely\add* protected them by the power \f + \ft metonymy \f* that you gave me. As a result,
only one of them will be eternally separated from you. He is the one who was doomed to be eternally separated from you.
\add That has happened\add* to fulfill \add what a prophet wrote\add* in the Scriptures
\add would happen\add*. 
\p
\v 13  \add Father\add*, now I am about to return to you. I have said these things while I am still
\add here\add* in the world in order that my \add disciples\add* may fully experience being joyful, as I have been joyful.
\v 14 I have given them your message. As a result, those who are opposed to you \f + \ft metonymy \f* have hated them, because
\add my disciples\add* do not belong to those who oppose you \f + \ft metonymy \f*, just like I do not belong to those who oppose you \f + \ft metonymy \f*.
\v 15 I am asking you, not that you take them out of this world, but instead that you protect them from
\add Satan\add*, the evil one. 
\v 16 They do not belong to those who are opposed to you \f + \ft metonymy \f*, just like I also do not belong to them.
\v 17 Set \add my disciples\add* apart so that they may completely belong to\f + \ft Or: serve \f* you, by
\add enabling them to live in accordance with\add* what is true. Your message is true.
\v 18 Just like you sent me here into this world, now I surely will be sending them
\add to other places\add* in \f + \ft metonymy \f* the world. 
\v 19 I set myself apart to completely belong to you, in order that they also may truly be dedicated \f + \ft Or:dedicate themselves \f*
completely to you." 
\s John 17:20-26 
\s Jesus prayed for future believers. 
\p
\v 20 "I am praying not only for these \add eleven disciples\add*. I am praying also for those who
\add will\add* believe in me as a result of \add hearing\add* their message.
\v 21  \add My\add* Father, \add I want\add* all of them to be united, just like I am united with you because of my
relationship with you and as you are united with me because of your relationship with me. I also want them to be united with
us. \add I want that to happen\add* so that those who do not know you \f + \ft metonymy \f* may know that you sent me.
\v 22 I have honored my disciples just like you honored me, in order that they may be united, as we are united.
\v 23 I want them to be united just like they are united with me and as you are united with me. May they be completely united,
in order that those who do not belong to you \f + \ft metonymy \f* may know that you sent me and that you have loved them just like you have
loved me. 
\p
\v 24  \add My\add* Father, I want \add the disciples\add* you have brought to me to
\add some day\add* be with me \add in heaven\add*, where I will be. I want them to see my greatness. I want them to see the
greatness you gave me because you loved me. You gave me that greatness before you created the world.
\p
\v 25  \add My\add* righteous Father, although the people who do not belong to you \f + \ft metonymy \f* do not know what you
\add are like\add*, I know what you \add are like\add*, and my disciples know that you sent me.
\v 26 I have revealed to them \add what\add* you \add are like\add*, and I will continue to reveal to them
\add what\add* you \add are like\add*. I will do that in order that they may love
\add others\add* just like you love me, and in order that I may live in them
\add by my Spirit\add*."
