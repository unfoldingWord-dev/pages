\s John 11:1-16 
\s Jesus' friend, Lazarus, died. 
\p
\v 1  \add One time\add* there was a man whose name was Lazarus who was
\add very\add* sick. He lived in Bethany \add village\add*, where his
\add older\add* sisters Mary and Martha lived. 
\v 2 Mary was the woman who \add later\add* poured perfume on the feet of the Lord
\add Jesus\add*, and then wiped his feet with her hair. 
\v 3 So the two sisters sent \add someone to tell\add* Jesus \add about
Lazarus\add*, saying, ‘Lord, the one you love \add very much\add* is very sick.’
\v 4  \add They hoped that Jesus would come\add*, but when Jesus heard the message, he said, “The
\add purpose of his\add* being sick is not that he would die. Instead, the purpose is
\add that people may realize\add* how great God is, and that I, God's son, may be honored {that people may honor me, God's
son}, because of \add what I will do\add*.” 
\v 5 Jesus loved Martha and her \add younger\add* sister\add Mary\add* and Lazarus.
\v 6 But when Jesus heard that Lazarus was sick, he stayed \add where he
was\add* for two more days. 
\p
\v 7 Then he said to us disciples, “Let's go back to Judea.” 
\v 8 We said, “Teacher, just a short while ago the Jewish \add leaders\add* \f + \fr synecdoche \f* wanted to
\add kill you by\add* throwing stones at you. So ◄\add we think that you should
not\add* go back there again!/\add are you sure that you want to\add* go back there again?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*”
\v 9  \add To show us that nothing bad could happen to him until the time that God had
chosen\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f*, Jesus replied, “There are \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* twelve hours in the daytime,
\add which is enough time to do what God wants us to do\add*. People who walk in the daytime will not stumble
\add over things they cannot see\add*, because they see things by the light from the sun.
\v 10 It is when people walk in the nighttime that they stumble over things, because they have no light.”
\p
\v 11 After he said that, he told us, “Our friend Lazarus has gone to sleep. But I will go there so that I can wake him up.”
\v 12 So we said to him, “Lord, if he is sleeping, he will get well
\add . So you do not need to risk your life by going there\add*.”
\v 13 Jesus was speaking \add figuratively\add* about Lazarus' death, but we thought that he was talking about really being
asleep. 
\v 14 So then he told us plainly, “Lazarus is dead. 
\v 15 But for your sake I am glad that I was not there \add when he
died\add*, because I want you to believe \add more firmly that I\add*
◄\add am the Messiah/came from God\add*►. So now, \add instead of staying
here\add*, let's go to him.” 
\v 16 Then Thomas, who was {whom they} called ‘The Twin’, said to the rest of us disciples, “Let's all go, so that we may die
with him \add when his enemies kill him\add*.” 
\s John 11:17-40 
\s Lazarus' sisters expressed disappointment that Jesus did not come and heal Lazarus before he died.
\p
\v 17 When we arrived \add close to Bethany\add*, someone told Jesus that Lazarus
\add had died and had been buried and his body had\add* been in the tomb for four days.
\v 18 Bethany is less than ◄two miles/three kilometers► from Jerusalem.
\v 19 Many Jews had come \add from Jerusalem\add* to console Martha and Mary concerning
\add the death of\add* their \add younger\add* brother. 
\v 20 When Martha heard \add someone say\add* that Jesus was coming, she went
\add along the road\add* to meet him. But Mary stayed in the house.
\v 21 When Martha \add got to where Jesus was\add*, she said to him, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have
died \add because you would have healed him\add*! 
\v 22 But I know that even now God will do for you whatever you ask
\add concerning my brother\add*.” 
\v 23 Jesus said to her, “Your brother will become alive again!”
\v 24 Martha said to him, “I know that he will become alive again when all people become alive again on the
\add Judgment\add* day.” 
\v 25 Jesus said to her, “I am the one who \add enables people to\add* become alive again and who
\add causes people to\add* live \add eternally\add*. Those who believe in me, even if they die, they will live
\add again\add*. 
\v 26 Furthermore, all those who believe in me while they are alive,
\add their souls\add* will not die \add forever\add*. Do you believe that?”
\v 27 She said to him, “Yes, Lord! I believe that you are the Messiah, ◄the Son of God/the man who is also God►. You are the
one \add God promised to send\add* into the world!” 
\p
\v 28 After she said that, she returned \add to the house\add* and took her
\add younger\add* sister, Mary, aside and said to her, “The Teacher is close
\add to our village\add*, and he wants to talk to you.” 
\v 29 When Mary heard that, she got up quickly and went to him. 
\v 30 Jesus had not yet entered the village; he was still at the place where Martha met him.
\v 31 The Jews who were in the house with Mary, consoling her, saw Mary get up quickly and go outside. So they followed her,
thinking that she was going to the tomb \add where they had buried
Lazarus\add*, in order to cry there. 
\p
\v 32 When Mary got to where Jesus was and saw him, she prostrated herself at his feet and said, “Lord, if you had been here,
my \add younger\add* brother would not have died!” 
\v 33 When Jesus saw her crying, and saw that the Jews who had come with her were also crying, he was very angry
\add that Satan had caused Lazarus to die\add* \f + \fr (OR, very troubled) and disturbed in his spirit.
\v 34 He said, “Where have you buried ◄him/his body►?” They said to him, “Lord, come and see.”
\v 35 Jesus began to cry. 
\v 36 Then \add some of\add* the Jews said, “Look how much he loved Lazarus!”
\v 37 But some others said, “He enabled a blind man to see. So ◄he should have been able
to\add heal this man so that\add* he did not die!/why did he not
\add heal this man so that\add* he did not die?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*” 
\p
\v 38 Within himself Jesus was again very angry \add about Lazarus
dying\add* (OR, very troubled) \f*. He came to the tomb. It was a cave. The entrance had been covered with a large stone.
\v 39 Jesus said, “Take away the stone!” Martha, \add who, as I mentioned before, was an
older\add* sister of the man who had died, said, “Lord, his \add body\add* has been
\add in the tomb\add* for four days, so now there will be a bad smell!”
\v 40 Jesus said to her, “I told \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* you that if you believed \add in\add*
◄\add me/what I can do\add*►, you would see how great God is! Have
\add you forgotten that\add*?” 
\s John 11:41-48 
\s Jesus caused Lazarus to be alive again. 
\p
\v 41 So they took away the stone. Then Jesus looked up \add toward
heaven\add* and said, “My Father, I thank you that you heard me \add when I prayed about this
earlier\add*. 
\v 42 I know that you always hear me \add when I pray\add*. But instead
\add of just praying silently\add*, I said that for the sake of the people who are standing here. I want them to believe that
you sent me.” 
\v 43 After he said that, he shouted, “Lazarus, come out!” 
\v 44 The man who \add had been\add* dead came out! The strips of cloth were still wrapped around his
\add hands and feet\add*, and a cloth was still around his face,
\add but he came out\add*! Jesus said to them, “Take off the cloths so that he can walk easily!”
\add So they did that\add*. 
\p
\v 45 As a result, many of the Jews who had come to \add see\add* Mary and who had seen what Jesus did, believed that he
◄\add was the Messiah/had come from God\add*►. 
\v 46 But some of the \add others\add* went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.
\v 47 So the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered all the members of the
\add Jewish\add* Council together. They started saying \add to each
other\add*, “What are we going to do \add about Jesus\add*? He is performing many miracles!
\v 48 If we allow him to keep \add doing this\add*, everyone will believe ◄in him/that he
\add is the Messiah\add*►, \add and they will make him their king\add*. Then the Roman
\add army\add* will come and destroy our Temple and our whole nation of Israel!”
\s John 11:49-57 
\s The Jewish leaders decided to kill Jesus. 
\p
\v 49 One of the \add Jewish Council\add* members was Caiaphas. He was the Jewish high priest that year.
\add Hinting that they should get rid of Jesus\add*, he said to them, “You
\add talk as though you\add* do not know anything \f + \fr hyperbole \f*! 
\v 50 You do not realize that it would be much better for us if one man died for the sake of the people rather than that
\add the Romans kill\add* all the \add people of our Jewish\add* nation.”
\v 51 He said that, not because he thought of it himself. Instead, since he was the high priest that year, he was prophesying
that Jesus would die for the whole \add Jewish\add* nation. 
\v 52 But he was also prophesying that Jesus would die, not just for the Jews, but for all the people living in other lands who
\add would belong\add* to God, in order that he would unite \add all of them
into\add* one \add group\add*. 
\v 53 So from that day the \add Jewish leaders\add* started to make plans how they could kill Jesus.
\p
\v 54 Because of that, Jesus no longer traveled around publicly among the Jewish people. Instead, he left
\add Jerusalem, along\add* with us disciples, and went to a village called Ephraim, in an area near the desolate region. We
stayed there \add for a while\add*. 
\p
\v 55 When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover \add celebration\add*, many
\add Jews\add* went up to Jerusalem from other places in the country. They went there to perform the rituals to make themselves
acceptable \add to God\add* before the Passover \add celebration
started\add*. 
\v 56-57 The Jewish chief priests and Pharisees issued an order that if anyone found out where Jesus was, that person should
report it to them, in order that they could seize him. \add So the people thought that Jesus
would\add* probably \add not dare to come to the celebration\add*. But they kept looking for him, and as they were standing in
the Temple \add courtyard\add* they were saying to each other, “What do you think? He will not come to the celebration, will
he?”
