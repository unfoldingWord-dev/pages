\s John 2:1-11 
\s In Cana Jesus did his first miracle, turning water into delicious wine.
\p
\v 1 Two days later there was a wedding \add celebration\add* in Cana
\add town\add*, in Galilee \add district\add*. Jesus' mother was there.
\v 2 Jesus and \add we\add* his disciples \add were also there, because\add* we had been invited \f + \ft Or:someone had invited us \f* also.
\v 3 When the guests had drunk all the wine \add that was there\add*, Jesus' mother said to him, "The wine is all gone;
\add can you do something about that\add*?" 
\v 4 Jesus said to her, "Ma'am\f + \ft Or: Woman \f*, do not \add tell\add* me \add what to
do\add*!\f + \ft Or: why do you \add tell\add* me \add what to do\add*? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\add Let me take care of it\add*. It is not yet time \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add to
show\add* that I am \add the Messiah by working miracles\add*." 
\v 5 Then Jesus' mother said to the servants, "Do whatever he tells you!"
\v 6 There were six \add empty\add* stone jars there. The Jews \add put water in
them\add* to use for washing things \add to make them acceptable to
God\add*. Each jar held 20 to 30 gallons\f + \ft Or: 80 to 120 liters \f*. 
\v 7 Jesus said to the servants, "Fill the jars with water!" So they filled the jars to the brim.
\v 8 Then he told them, "Now, ladle out some \add of it\add* and take it to the head waiter\f + \ft Or: to the master of ceremonies \f*." So
the servants did that. 
\v 9 The head waiter\f + \ft Or: The master of ceremonies \f* tasted the water, which had now become wine. He did not know where the wine had
come from, but the servants who had ladled out the wine knew. \add The wine was
delicious\add*! So he called the bridegroom over, 
\v 10 and said to him, "Everyone \add else\add* serves the best wine first. Then when the guests have drunk so much
\add that they cannot tell the difference\add*, \add they serve\add* the cheap wine. But you
\add have not done what others do\add*. You have kept the best wine until now!"
\v 11 That was the first miracle that Jesus did. He did it in Cana
\add town\add*, in Galilee \add district\add*. By doing it he showed how awesome he is, and as a result,
\add we\add* his disciples believed that he \add truly was the Messiah\add*.
\s John 2:12 
\s Jesus and others went to Capernaum and stayed there several days.
\p
\v 12 Jesus then went down to Capernaum \add city\add* with his mother and
\add younger\add* brothers and \add us\add* his disciples. We stayed there several days.
\s John 2:13-25 
\s After Jesus expelled the merchants from the temple, the Jewish leaders wanted him to do a miracle to show by what authority
he did that. He told them metaphorically that he would become alive again three days after he died.
\p
\v 13 Later, when it was almost time for the Jewish Passover \add celebration\add*, Jesus
\add and we his disciples\add* went up to Jerusalem. 
\v 14 There, in the Temple \add courtyard\add*, he saw some men who were selling cattle, sheep, and pigeons
\add for sacrifices\add*. He also saw men who were sitting at tables,
\add making a big profit as they\add* gave people \add Temple tax\add* coins in exchange
for\add their Roman\add* coins. 
\v 15 Then Jesus made a whip from some cords and \add used it to\add* chase out the sheep and cattle from the Temple
\add courtyard\add*. By overturning their tables he scattered the coins of the men who were exchanging them.
\v 16 He said to those who were selling doves, "Take these doves away
\add from here\add*! Stop \add defiling\add* my Father's Temple \add by\add* making it a market!"
\v 17 Then \add we\add* disciples remembered that these words had been written \f + \ft Or:that
\add someone( Or: David )\add* had written \add these words\add* \f* \add in the Scriptures prophesying what the Messiah would
say\add*: "Others \f + \ft personification \f* will strongly oppose me because I greatly desire that
\add people respect\add* your Sacred Tent." 
\p
\v 18 So \add one of\add* the Jewish \add leaders\add* \f + \ft synecdoche \f* replied to him, "What miracle will you perform to show us that
\add you have authority from God\add* to do these things?" 
\v 19 Jesus replied to them, "If\f + \ft Or: When \f* you destroy this temple, I will build it again within three days."
\v 20 So the Jewish \add leaders\add* \f + \ft synecdoche \f* said, "We have been building this Temple for forty-six years
\add and it is not finished yet\add*! So there is no way you will build it within three days!\f + \ft Or: how will you build it within
three days? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*" 
\v 21 But when Jesus said that about the temple, \add he was really talking
about\add* his own body. 
\v 22  \add Later\add*, after Jesus had \add died and had\add* become alive again,
\add we\add* his disciples remembered the words he had said. As a result, we believed
\add what had been prophesied in\add* the Scriptures \add about the Messiah becoming alive
again\add*, and we believed that what Jesus said \add was true\add*.
\p
\v 23 While Jesus was in Jerusalem at the Passover celebration, many people came to believe
\add that he was the Messiah\add* because they saw the miracles he was performing.
\v 24 But he did not let them tell him what he should do \add as the
Messiah\add*, because he knew within himself what they were all \add thinking\add*.
\v 25 He did not need anyone to tell him what others were thinking, because he already knew what they were
\add thinking and wanting\add*.
