\s John 18:1-11 
\s They seized Jesus in a grove of olive trees. 
\p
\v 1 After Jesus finished praying, he went across the Kidron Brook, along with
\add us\add* disciples, to a grove \add of olive trees\add*. 
\p
\v 2 Judas, who was \add about to\add* enable Jesus' enemies to seize him, knew that
\add he would probably be\add* there. \add He knew that because\add* Jesus often gathered there with us.
\v 3 So Judas came to that grove. He was leading a troop of Roman
\add soldiers\add* and some Temple guards who had been sent by the Pharisees and chief priests. They were carrying torches and
lamps and weapons. 
\v 4 Jesus knew everything that was about to happen to him. So \add as they
approached\add*, he stepped forward and asked them, “Who are you looking for?”
\v 5 They replied to him, “Jesus, the man from Nazareth.” He replied, “That is who I am.” Judas, the one who was enabling his
enemies to seize him, was with them. 
\v 6 When Jesus told them, “That is who I am,” they lurched backward and fell down on the ground
\add because of his power\add*. 
\v 7 He asked them again, “Who are you looking for?” They said, “Jesus,
\add the man\add* from Nazareth.” 
\v 8 Jesus replied, “I told you that I am Jesus. So since I am the one you are looking for, allow these
\add disciples of mine\add* to go.” 
\v 9  \add This happened\add* in order that \add when they did what he asked them to
do\add*, the words would be fulfilled that he had prayed, ‘I will never lose any of those whom God has brought to me.’
\p
\v 10 Simon Peter had a \add long\add* dagger. So he drew it and
\add tried to kill\add* the high priest's servant, \add but he only\add* cut off the man's right ear. The servant's name was
Malchus. 
\v 11 Jesus said to Peter, “Put your sword \add back\add* into its sheath! ◄I must endure what
\add my\add* Father wants me to suffer.\f + \ft Or: Do \f* you not think that I must endure what
\add my\add* Father wants me to suffer?► [MET, RHQ]” 
\s John 18:12-14 
\s They took Jesus to be questioned by Annas, the former high priest.
\p
\v 12 Then the troop of soldiers, along with their commander and the Jewish Temple guards, seized Jesus. They tied his hands
\add behind his back\add*. 
\v 13 Then they took him first to Annas, \add who was previously the high
priest\add*. He was the father-in-law of Caiaphas. Caiaphas was the high priest that year.
\v 14 He was the one who \add previously\add* advised the Jewish
\add Council\add* that it would be better if one man died for the sake of the people
\add than for all the people of the Jewish nation to die\add*. 
\s John 18:15-18 
\s Peter denied that he was Jesus' disciple. 
\p
\v 15 Simon Peter and \add I\add* were following Jesus. Because the high priest knew
\add me\add*, \add his doorkeeper permitted me\add* to enter the courtyard.
\v 16 But Peter \add had to\add* wait outside near the doorway. However, since I knew the high priest, I went back to the
doorway and spoke to the girl who was guarding the entrance. Then
\add she allowed\add* Peter to come in. 
\v 17 The servant girl who was guarding the doorway said to Peter, “Surely you are not another disciple of that man
\add they have arrested\add*, are you?” He said, “I am not.” 
\v 18 It was cold, so the high priest's slaves and Temple guards made a charcoal fire and were standing around it to keep warm.
Peter was also standing near it, warming himself. 
\s John 18:19-24 
\s The High Priest questioned Jesus. 
\p
\v 19  \add While Peter was doing that\add*, the high priest asked Jesus about his disciples and about what he was teaching
people. 
\v 20 Jesus replied, “I have always spoken where many people [MTY, HYP] could hear me. I have taught them in the
synagogues\f + \ft Or: their meeting places \f* and in the Temple courtyard, in places where many \f + \ft hyperbole \f* Jews come together. I have spoken
nothing secretly. 
\v 21  \add So\add* ◄why are you asking me questions \add like this
illegally\add*?\f + \ft Or: you \f* should not be asking me questions \add like this
illegally\add*!► \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* Ask the people who heard what I taught! They certainly know what I said!”
\v 22 After Jesus said that, one of the Temple guards standing near him slapped him on his face. He said, “That is not the way
you should answer the high priest!\f + \ft Or: Is that the way you should answer the high priest? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*”
\v 23 Jesus replied to him, “If I had said something that was contrary
\add to your laws\add*, you could have told \add me that what I said
that\add* was wrong. But because I said only what was right, you should not be striking me!\f + \ft Or: why are you striking me? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*”
\v 24 Then after Jesus' hands were tied {after they tied Jesus hands}
\add again\add*, Annas sent him to Caiaphas, the high priest. 
\s John 18:25-27 
\s Peter denied two more times that he knew Jesus. 
\p
\v 25 As Simon Peter was standing warming himself \add at the fire\add*, someone else said to him, “You are not one of that
man's disciples, are you?” He denied \add that he was\add*, and said, “I am not.”
\v 26  \add Later\add* one of the high priest's servants, a man who was a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off
\add before\add*, said to him, “I saw you with that man in the grove
\add of olive trees\add*, did I not?” 
\v 27 Peter again denied it. Immediately a rooster crowed, \add as Jesus had said would
happen\add*. 
\s John 18:28-40 
\s Pilate the governor questioned Jesus. 
\p
\v 28 Then the \add Jewish leaders\add* \f + \ft synecdoche \f* led Jesus from the
\add home of\add* Caiaphas to the headquarters \add of Pilate, the Roman
governor\add*. It was before dawn. \add Pilate was a non-Jew\add*,
\add and they thought that if they entered his headquarters\add*, they would become unacceptable to God {God would reject
them}, \add and as a result\add* they would not be able to eat \add the food
during\add* the Passover \add celebration\add*. \add Because of that, they did not want to enter Pilate's
headquarters\add*. 
\v 29 So Pilate came out to \add talk to\add* them. He said, “What law do you say that this man has disobeyed?”
\v 30  \add They knew that Jesus had not disobeyed any Roman law, so they did not want to answer him.
Instead\add*, they said, “If this man were not a criminal, we would not have brought him to you!”
\v 31 Then Pilate said to them, “Take him yourselves, and judge him according to your own laws!” Then the Jewish
\add leaders\add* \f + \ft synecdoche \f* said, “\add No! We want him executed, but we want you Romans to execute him,
because\add* we Jews have no right to execute anyone!” 
\v 32  \add The Romans executed people by nailing them to a cross\add*.
\add So\add*, as a result of what \add the Jewish leaders said\add*, it was fulfilled
{\add the Romans\add* would fulfill} what Jesus had said previously about the way he was going to die.
\p
\v 33 Pilate then went back inside his headquarters. He summoned Jesus.
\add Because the Jewish leaders had said that Jesus claimed to be a
king\add*, he said to him \add scornfully\add*, “Are you the king of the Jews?”
\v 34 Jesus replied, “Are you asking that because you yourself \add want to know if I claim to be a
king\add*, or because someone else\f + \ft Or: Caiaphas \f* said \add that I claim to be their
king\add*?” 
\v 35 Pilate replied, “I am not a Jew, \add so\add* ◄\add I cannot understand these matters!\f + \ft Or: how \f* can I understand these
matters\add*?► \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* It was your fellow Jews and your chief priests who brought you to me! What have you done
\add to make them want to execute you\add*?” 
\v 36 Jesus replied, “It is not people in \f + \ft metonymy \f* this world who are
\add making me\add* king. If it was people in this world who were making me a king, my disciples would have fought in order
that the Jewish \add leaders\add* \f + \ft synecdoche \f* would be prevented {to prevent the Jewish
\add leaders\add* \f + \ft synecdoche \f*} from seizing me. But it is not \add someone here
in\add* this world who is making me a king.” 
\v 37 Then Pilate said to him, “So \add are you saying that\add* you are a king?” Jesus replied,
“\add Yes\add*, what you have said about my being a king \add is
correct\add*. I was born to become a king, and I came into this world to tell people the truth
\add about God\add*. Everyone who \add believes\add* the truth pays attention to what I say.”
\v 38 Pilate said to him, “\add How can anyone know\add* what the truth is?”
\p After he said that, he went outside and talked to the Jewish \add leaders\add* \f + \ft synecdoche \f* again. He said to them, “I do not find
that he has done anything at all for which I should punish him. 
\v 39 But you \add Jews\add* customarily, \add every year\add* during the Passover
\add celebration\add*, ask me to release for you \add someone who is in
prison\add*. So would you like for me to release for you the \add man who
you\add* Jews \add say is your\add* king?” 
\v 40 They shouted again, “No, do not \add release\add* this man! Instead,
\add release\add* Barrabas!” But Barrabas was \add in prison because he
was\add* a revolutionist!
