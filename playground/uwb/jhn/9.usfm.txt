\c 9  
\s John 9:1-12 
\s Jesus healed a man who was born blind. 
\p
\v 1 As Jesus walked along \add with us\add*, he saw a man who had been blind from the time he was born.
\v 2 We disciples asked him, "Teacher, was this man blind from when he was born because his parents sinned or because he
himself sinned?" 
\v 3 Jesus replied, "His being blind was not because he or his parents sinned. Instead,
\add he has been blind\add* in order that \add people can\add* see the power of God \f + \ft Or:the power of God can be seen \f* as a result
of \add what will now happen\add* to him. 
\v 4 While there is still time, I must do the work that the one who sent me
\add wants me to do. Just like daytime is followed by\add* nighttime when people do not work,
\add at the end of our lives\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add it is too late for us to do what God
wants\add*. 
\v 5 While I am still \add living\add* in this world, I am the \add one who enables people to know about God,
like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add a\add* light enables the people in \f + \ft metonymy \f* this world
\add to see what is in the darkness\add*." 
\p
\v 6 After he said that, he spat on the ground. He made \add a little bit
of\add* mud with the saliva, and put it on the man's eyes. 
\v 7 Then he said to him, "Go and wash in Siloam pool!" (That name means 'sent;'
\add just like they sent the water by a channel into the pool, God sent
Jesus\add*). So the man went and washed \add in the pool\add*, and when he went home he was able to see!
\v 8 His neighbors and others who previously had seen him when he was begging said, "He is the man who used to sit here and
beg, isn't he?" 
\v 9 Some said, "\add Yes\add*, he is." Others said, "No, \add he is
not\add*. It is \add just\add* a man who looks like him!" But the man himself said, "Yes, I am that man!"
\v 10 So they said to him, "How is it that now you can see?" 
\v 11 He replied, "The man whose name is Jesus made some mud and put it on my eyes. Then he told me to go to Siloam
\add pool\add* and wash. So I went there and washed, and then I could see."
\v 12 They said to him, "Where is that man \add now\add*?" He said, "I do not know."
\s John 9:13-41 
\s The Pharisees investigated the healing of the blind man. 
\p
\v 13 They took to the Pharisees the man who was previously blind.
\v 14 The day on which Jesus made the mud and enabled the man to see again was a Sabbath\f + \ft Or: Jewish day of rest \f*.
\add The Pharisees considered that healing someone was work, and their rules did not permit people to do any
work\add* \add on the Sabbath\f + \ft Or: on the Jewish rest day\add* \f*. 
\v 15 So the Pharisees also asked him, "How did you become able to see?" He said to them, "The man put mud on my eyes. Then I
washed, and now I can see!" 
\v 16 So some of the Pharisees said, "Since this man \add Jesus\add* disobeys
\add our rules about working\add* on the Sabbath\f + \ft Or: on the Jewish rest day \f*, he is not from God." But others said, "If he was a
sinner, he could certainly not do such miracles!\f + \ft Or: how could he do such miracles? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*" So they were divided.
\v 17 So one of them said to the blind man again, "You are the man whom he enabled to see. What do you yourself say about him?"
The man said, "\add I think\add* he is a prophet!" \add So they told him to
go\add*. 
\p
\v 18 The Jewish \add leaders\add* \f + \ft synecdoche \f* still did not believe that the man was blind when he was born, and that he was
\add now\add* able to see. So they sent someone to bring the man's parents.
\v 19  \add When they got there\add*, one of \add the Jewish leaders\add* asked them, "Is that man your son? Do you say that he
was blind when he was born? \add If that is true\add*, how is he now able to see?"
\v 20 His parents replied, "We know that he is our son. We know that he was blind when he was born.
\v 21 But we do not know how he is able to see now. We also do not know who enabled him to see. Ask our son! He is old enough
\add to answer questions from authorities like you\add*! He can tell you himself!"
\v 22 The Jewish \add leaders\add* \f + \ft synecdoche \f* had previously declared that they would prevent anyone who declared that Jesus was the
Messiah from \add entering\add* their synagogues. His parents \add knew that,
so\add* they were afraid of the Jewish \add leaders\add* \f + \ft synecdoche \f*. 
\v 23 That is the reason that they said, "He is old enough \add to answer
questions\add*, so ask him!" 
\p
\v 24 So they sent someone to bring back to them the man who had been blind.
\add When he got there\add*, the \add Jewish leaders\add* said to him, "Knowing that God
\add is listening\add* \f + \ft idiom \f*, tell the truth! We know that the man who healed you is a sinner."
\v 25 He replied, "I do not know if he is a sinner or not. But one thing I do know is that I was blind, but now I can see!"
\v 26 So they said to him, "What did he do to you? How did he enable you to see?"
\v 27 He replied, "I told you that already, but you did not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* pay attention! Why do you want to hear me tell you again? Do
you also want to become his disciples?\f + \ft Or: You talk as though ( irony ) you also want to become his disciples \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \f*."
\v 28 Then they insulted him angrily. They said, "You are that man's disciple, but we are Moses' disciples!
\v 29 We know that God spoke to Moses; but this man, we do not know where he is from or where he
\add gets any authority\add* from!" 
\v 30 The man replied, "That is very surprising! You \add say that\add* you do not know where he
\add gets any authority\add*. But he enabled me to see! 
\v 31 We know that God does not help sinners \add who ask God to help
them\add*. Instead, he listens to \add and helps\add* godly people who pray. He listens to people who do what God wants.
\v 32 No one has ever enabled a man to see who was blind when he was born
\add like I was\add*. That has never happened since the world began!
\v 33 So if this man had not come from God, he would not be able to do anything
\add like that\add*!" 
\v 34 They replied to him, "You were born \add as a result of your
parents'\add* sin \f + \ft euphemism \f*\f + \ft Or: bastard \f*! Do you think you are qualified to teach us?\f + \ft Or: You are not qualified to teach us! \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*" Then
they threw him out \add of the synagogue\add*. 
\p
\v 35 Jesus heard \add people say\add* that they had thrown that man out. He found the man and said to him, "Do you believe
that the one who came down from heaven \add is the Messiah\add*?"
\v 36 The man answered, "Sir, who is he? \add Tell me\add*, in order that I may believe in him."
\v 37 Jesus said to him, "You have seen him. \add In fact, it is
I\add*, the one who am speaking to you." 
\v 38 The man said, "Lord, I believe that \add you are the Messiah\add*!" Then he
\add knelt down before\add* Jesus and worshipped him. 
\p
\v 39 Jesus said, "I have come into this world to judge \add the people in the
world\add*. The result will be that \add those who realize that they do not know God's truth will perceive it. That is
like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add enabling\add* those who are blind to see. But the result will also be that people who
\add falsely think\add* \f + \ft irony \f* that \add they understand God's truth will never understand it. That is
like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add people\add* who are blind remaining blind permanently."
\v 40 Some of the Pharisees who were with him heard him say that, and said to him, "You are not suggesting that we are
\add like\add* blind people, are you?" 
\v 41 Jesus said to them, "If you \add realized that you did not yet know God's truth, but you wanted to, then you would be
like\add* blind people \add who wanted to see. God would be able
to\add* forgive your sins. But you are now \add falsely\add* claiming that you
\add know God's truth, so you are like people who are blind who claim that
they\add* can see. \add Because of that, God is not able to\add* forgive your sins."
