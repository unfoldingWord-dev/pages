\s John 20:1-9 
\s On Sunday morning they discovered that Jesus' tomb was empty.
\p
\v 1 Early on Sunday morning, while it was still dark, Mary, the woman from Magdala
\add village\add*, went to the \add burial\add* cave \add with some other
women\add*. She saw that the stone had been removed {that someone had removed the stone} from the
\add entrance to the\add* cave. 
\v 2 So she ran to where Simon Peter and I \add were staying in Jerusalem\add*. She said to us, "They have taken the Lord's
\add body\add* out of the burial cave, and we do not know where they have put it!"
\v 3 So Peter and I started going to the cave. 
\v 4 We were both running, but I ran faster than Peter and got there first.
\v 5 I stooped down \add at the entrance\add* and looked inside. I saw the strips of linen cloth lying there
\add where his body had been laid\add*, but I did not go inside.
\v 6 Then Simon Peter, who was running behind me, arrived. He went inside the cave. He, too, saw the strips of linen cloth
lying there. 
\v 7 He also \add saw the\add* cloth that they had \add wrapped\add* around Jesus' head. It had been folded and put {Someone
had folded it and put it} aside, separate from the linen strips.
\v 8 Then I also went inside. I saw \add those things\add* and I believed
\add that Jesus had truly become alive again\add*. 
\v 9 Before this happened, we did not understand from \add what the prophets had written
in\add* the Scriptures, that he had to become alive again after he died.
\s John 20:10-18 
\s Jesus appeared to Mary from Magdala. 
\p
\v 10 Then \add we two\add* disciples went back to where we were staying.
\add In the meantime\add*, Mary\add returned to the cave\add*. 
\v 11 As she stood outside the cave crying, she stooped down to look inside the cave.
\v 12 She saw two angels in very white \add clothing\add*, sitting at the place where Jesus' body had been laid. One was where
his head had been, and the other was where his feet had been. 
\v 13 They said to her, "Woman, why are you crying?" She said to them, "They have taken away
\add the body of\add* my Lord, and I do not know where they have put it!"
\v 14 After she said that, she turned around and saw Jesus standing
\add there\add*, but she did not know that it was Jesus. 
\v 15 He said to her, "Woman, why are you crying? Who are you looking for?" Thinking that he was the gardener, she said to him,
"Sir, if you have taken his \add body\add* away, tell me where you have put it. Then I will get it
\add and bury it properly\add*." 
\v 16 Jesus said to her, "Mary!" She turned toward him \add again and recognized
him\add*. Then she exclaimed in Aramaic, "Rabboni!" which means 'Teacher'.
\v 17 Jesus said to her, "Stop clinging to me, because I have not yet returned to my Father. Go to my disciples and tell them,
'I am about to return to my Father and your Father, to the one who is my God and your God'."
\v 18 So Mary went to where \add we\add* disciples were and told us that she had seen the Lord
\add alive again\add*. She also told us what Jesus said that she
\add should tell us\add*. 
\s John 20:19-25 
\s Jesus appeared to many of his disciples. 
\p
\v 19 On that Sunday evening \add we\add* disciples gathered together. The doors were locked
{\add We\add* locked the doors} because we were afraid that \add the Jewish
leaders\add* \f + \ft synecdoche \f* \add might arrest us. Suddenly\add* Jesus appeared
\add miraculously\add* and stood among us! He said to us, "May God give you
\add inner\add* peace!" 
\v 20 After he said that, he showed us \add the wounds in\add* his hands and his side. We were very happy when we saw the Lord!
\v 21 Jesus said to us again, "May God give you peace! Just like
\add my\add* Father sent me, now I am sending you \add to proclaim my
message\add*." 
\v 22 After saying that, he breathed on us and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit!
\v 23 If you forgive people for their having sinned, \add God will
already\add* have forgiven them. If you do not forgive them, \add God\add* has not forgiven them."
\p
\v 24 One of us disciples, Thomas, the one whom we called The Twin, was not with us when Jesus appeared to us.
\v 25 When the rest of us told him that we had seen the Lord, he said to us, "If I do not see the marks of the nails in his
hands and put my fingers in the place where the nails were, and put my hands into the place in his side
\add where the soldier thrust the spear\add*, I will certainly not believe
\add that he was the one you saw\add*!" 
\s John 20:26-29 
\s Jesus appeared to all of his disciples, including Thomas. 
\p
\v 26 A week later we were in \add the house\add* again. This time Thomas was with us. Although the doors had been locked
{\add we\add* had locked the doors}, Jesus \add again\add* appeared
\add miraculously\add* and stood among us. He said, "May God give peace to you!"
\v 27 Then he \add showed\add* Thomas \add his hands\add* and said to him, "Put your finger here! Look at
\add the wounds in\add* my hands! Reach out your hand and put it in
\add the wound in\add* my side! Stop doubting [LIT\f + \ft Or: DOU \f*]! Instead, believe
\add that I am alive again\add*!" 
\v 28 Thomas answered him, "\add You are truly\add* my Lord and my God!"
\v 29 Jesus said to him, "Because you have seen me, you have believed
\add that about me\add*. But God \add is truly\add* pleased with those who have believed
\add that about me\add*, even though they have not seen me!" 
\s John 20:30-31 
\s John stated the purpose of this book. 
\p
\v 30  \add We\add* disciples saw Jesus perform many other miracles, but
\add I\add* have not written about them in this book. 
\v 31 But these \add that I have written about, I\add* have written about them in order that you may believe that Jesus is the
Messiah, the Son of God\f + \ft Or: the man who is also God \f*, and in order that you may have
\add eternal\add* life \add by trusting\add* in him\add \f + \ft Or: \add*in what he
\add has done for you\add* \f* \f + \ft metonymy \f*.
