\c 14  
\s John 14:1-14 
\s Jesus encouraged his disciples and told them that he is the only way to the Father.
\p
\v 1  \add Jesus continued by saying to us\add*, “Stop being anxious/worried. Keep on trusting in God (OR, You are trusting in
God); also keep trusting in me. 
\v 2 Where my Father is \add in heaven\add* there is plenty of room! If that were not true, I would have told you. I am about
to go \add there\add* to prepare a place for you. 
\v 3 And because I will go \add there\add* and prepare a place for you, I will return and take you to be with me. I will do
that so that you may also be where I am. 
\v 4 You know the road to the place where I am going.” 
\p
\v 5 Thomas said to him, “Lord, we do not know where you are going.
\add So\add* how can we know the road?” 
\v 6 Jesus said to him, “I am the road \f + \fr metaphor \f* \add to where my Father
is\add*. I am the \add one who reveals\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f* the truth \add about
God\add* and the \add one who gives eternal\add* life \add to people\add*. I am the only one who can
\add enable people\add* to come to \add my\add* Father. There is no other way.
\v 7 If you \add really\add* knew who I was, you would have known my Father also. From now on, you know him, and
\add it is as though\add* you have seen him.” 
\p
\v 8 Philip said to him, “Lord, show us your Father and that will be enough for us!”
\v 9 Jesus said to him, “Philip, I have been with you for a long time. So ◄surely you should know who I
\add really am\add*!/why have you not come to know who I \add really
am\add*?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* Those who have seen me, \add it is as though\add* they have seen
\add my\add* Father. So ◄why do you say ‘Show us \add your\add* Father’?/you should not say ‘Show us
\add your\add* Father’!► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* 
\v 10 Do you not \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* believe that I have a close relationship with
\add my\add* Father, and that \add my\add* Father has a close relationship with me? The messages that I tell you do not come
from me. They come from my Father, who has a close relationship with me. He is enabling me to
\add teach these things, and\add* to work the miracles that he \add wants me to
do\add*. 
\v 11 Believe that I have a close relationship with \add my\add* Father and that
\add my\add* Father has a close relationship with me. If you do not believe that just because of what I say, believe it because
of the miracles themselves \add that I have done\add*. 
\v 12 Listen to this carefully: \add You\add* who trust in me will do the
\add kinds of\add* miracles \add that I have done\add*. \add Because of what I will do for
you\add* (OR\add , Because I will send God's Spirit to you\add*) after I go to my Father, you will be able to do
\add miracles\add* that will be greater than \add the ones I have
done\add*. 
\v 13 And whatever you, using my authority, ask me to do, I will do it, in order that I can show
\add you\add* how great \add my\add* Father is. 
\v 14 Anything that you ask \add my Father to do, anything that you
ask\add* with my \add authority\add* \f + \fr metonymy \f*, I will do.” 
\s John 14:15-31 
\s Jesus promised to send the Holy Spirit to them. 
\p
\v 15 “If you love me, you will do what I have commanded you. 
\v 16 Then I myself will request \add my\add* Father, and he will send you someone else who will ◄encourage/be like a legal
counsel for► you. 
\v 17  \add I am talking about\add* the Spirit, who \add will teach you
God's\add* truth. He will be with you forever. Those who are opposed to God \f + \fr metonymy \f* cannot receive him, because they cannot
understand what he \add does\add*, and they cannot know who he is. But you know who he is, because he is with you and he will
be inside you. 
\v 18  \add When I leave you\add*, I will not let you be alone/helpless \f + \fr metaphor \f*.
\add When I send the Spirit, it will be like\add* I am coming back to you (OR,
\add When I rise from the dead\add*, I will come back to you.) 
\v 19 Soon those who do not belong to God \f + \fr metonymy \f* will not see me anymore. But
\add when the Spirit comes to you, it will be as though\add* you will be seeing me again (OR, But
\add after I become alive again\add*, you will see me again.) Because I will be alive again, you also will have
\add eternal\add* life. 
\v 20 At that time you will know that I have a close relationship with my Father, and you will have a close relationship with
me, and I will have a close relationship with you. 
\v 21 Those who have accepted my commands and obey them are the people who love me. My Father will love those who love me. I
also will love them, and I will fully reveal to them \add what I am
like\add*.” 
\p
\v 22 Then Judas spoke to him. He was not Judas Iscariot, \add but instead a disciple whose other name was
Thaddeus\add*. He said, “Lord, what has happened so that you can fully reveal to us what you are like, and not reveal that to
those who do not belong to God \f + \fr metonymy \f*?” 
\v 23 Jesus replied to him, “Those who love me will obey what I have told them. My Father will
\add also\add* love them. It is those people whom my Father and I will
\add be able to\add* come to and ◄live with/have a personal relationship with►.
\v 24 But those who do not love me will not obey what I have told them.
\add So I cannot reveal to them what I am really like\add*. 
\p These words that I am telling you have not come just from me. They came from
\add my\add* Father, the one who sent me. 
\v 25 I have told you all these things while I am still with you.
\v 26 But \add my\add* Father will send the Holy Spirit. He is the one who will ◄encourage/be like a legal counsel for► you. He
will come with my authority \f + \fr metonymy \f*. He will teach you all of \add God's truth that you need to
know\add*. He will also cause you to remember all the things that I have told you.
\v 27 As I leave you, I am causing you to have \add inner\add* peace. This
\add inner\add* peace comes from me. I am not causing you to have something that those who do not belong to God \f + \fr metonymy \f* can give
you. \add So\add* stop being anxious/worried, and do not be afraid.
\p
\v 28 You heard me say to you, ‘I am going away, but \add later\add* I will come back to you.’ If you loved me, you would be
glad that I am going back to \add my\add* Father, because \add my\add* Father is greater than I am,
\add and there he will honor me and will send the Spirit to you\add*.
\v 29 I have told you\add these things now\add* before they happen, so that when they happen you will believe
\add that what I said is true\add*. 
\v 30 I will not \add be able to\add* talk to you much longer, because what happens to me will be as though
\add Satan\add*, the ruler of this world, is coming\add to attack
me\add*. But he has no \add control over what happens to\add* me.
\v 31 Instead, the people who do not belong to God \f + \fr metonymy \f* must learn
\add from what happens to me\add* that I love \add my\add* Father, and I am doing the things that he has commanded me to do.
Now, let's get up and leave here.”
