\c 23  
\s David's final message 
\p
\v 1 David, the son of Jesse, was a man whom \add God caused to\add* become great.
\q He was appointed to become king by the God whom Jacob \add worshiped\add*.
\q He wrote beautiful songs for the people of Israel. 
\q This is the last song that he wrote: 
\b
\q
\v 2 The Spirit of Yahweh tells me what to say; 
\q the message that I speak [MTY] comes from him. 
\q
\v 3 God, the one whom we Israeli \add people worship\add*, has spoken;
\q2 the one who protects us people of Israel said to me, 
\q “Kings who rule people justly 
\q have an awesome respect for God. 
\q
\v 4 They are like the sun that shines at dawn 
\q2 and causes the grass to \add sprout/sparkle\add* after the rain ends.”
\b
\q
\v 5 And truly, that is how God will surely bless my family [RHQ]
\q2 because he made an agreement with me that will endure forever,
\q2 an agreement in which he promises that no part of it will ever be changed.
\q He will surely cause me to prosper [RHQ], 
\q2 and he will always help me, 
\q and that is all that I desire. 
\q
\v 6 But \add he will get rid of\add* godless/evil people like [SIM] people throw away thorns
\q2 that \add injure people if they try to\add* pick them up with their hands.
\q
\v 7 Someone \add who wants to get rid of thornbushes\add* does not grab them;
\q2 he uses an iron \add shovel\add* or a spear \add to dig them
out\add* 
\q2 and then he burns them completely. 
\s David's three greatest warriors 
\p
\v 8 These are the names of David's three greatest warriors. 
\p The first was Esh-Baal, \add whose other name was Jashobeam\add*, from the Hachmon clan (OR, the son of Hachmon). He was the
leader of the three men. One time he fought against eight hundred enemies and killed them all with his spear.
\p
\v 9 The second/next one of the three greatest warriors was Eleazar, who was the son of Dodo from the clan of Ahoh. One day he
was with David when they defied/challenged the soldiers of Philistia who had gathered there for the battle. The
\add other\add* Israeli soldiers retreated, 
\v 10 but Eleazar stood there and fought the soldiers of Philistia until his arm became very tired, with the result that
\add his hand cramped and\add* he could not stop gripping his sword. Yahweh won a great victory on that day. And afterwards the
\add other\add* Israeli soldiers returned \add to where Eleazar was\add*, and stripped off
\add the armor from the men whom he had\add* killed. 
\p
\v 11 The third one of the greatest warriors was Shammah, the son of Agee from the clan/town of Harar. One time the Philistia
soldiers gathered at Lehi \add town\add*, where there was a field full of lentils/peas
\add that they wanted to steal\add*. The other Israeli soldiers ran away from the Philistia troops,
\v 12 but Shammah stood there in the field and did not let the Philistia soldiers
\add steal the peas\add*, and killed them. Yahweh won a great victory on that day.
\s The thirty great warriors 
\p
\v 13 Altogether there were thirty special warriors among David's soldiers. One time, when it was almost time to harvest
\add the crops\add*, three of those thirty men went down to Adullam Cave, where David was
\add staying\add*. A group of men from the Philistia army had set up their tents in the Rephaim Valley
\add near Jerusalem\add*. 
\v 14 David \add and his soldiers\add* were in the cave \add because it was safe
there\add*, and \add another\add* group of Philistia soldiers was occupying Bethlehem.
\v 15  \add One day\add* David very much wanted \add some water\add* to drink, and said “I wish that someone would bring me
some water from the well near the gate at Bethlehem!” 
\v 16 So his three greatest warriors forced through the camp of Philistia soldiers and drew some water from the well, and
brought it to David. But he would not drink it. Instead, he poured it out
\add on the ground\add* to be an offering to Yahweh. 
\v 17 He said, “Yahweh, it would certainly not be right for me to drink this water! That would be like [RHQ] drinking the blood
of these men who were willing/ready to die for me!” So he refused to drink it.
\p That was one of the things that those three great warriors did.
\s The list of the great warriors 
\p
\v 18 Abishai, Joab's \add younger\add* brother, was the leader of the thirty
\add greatest warriors\add*. \add One day\add* he fought against three hundred men and killed them all with his spear. As a
result, he also became famous. 
\v 19 He was the most famous of the thirty greatest warriors, and he became their leader/commander, but he was not one of the
three greatest warriors. 
\p
\v 20 Jehoiada's son Benaiah, from Kabzeel \add town\add*, also did great deeds. He killed two of the best warriors from the
Moab people-group. Also, he went down into a pit on a day when snow was falling
\add on the ground\add*, and killed a lion there. 
\v 21 He also killed a huge soldier from Egypt who carried a spear. Benaiah
\add had only\add* his club, but he attacked the giant with it. Then he snatched the spear from the man's hand and killed him
with his own spear. 
\v 22 Those are \add some of\add* the things that Benaiah did. As a result, he became famous, like the three greatest warriors
were. 
\v 23 He was more honored than the other members of the group of thirty great warriors, but not as famous as the three greatest
warriors. David appointed him to be the commander of his bodyguards.
