\c 3  
\s 1 John 3:1-10 
\s Do not allow anyone to seduce you to sin, because you are God's children, and his children maintain themselves free from
evil behavior by not continuing to sin as the devil's children do.
\p
\v 1  \add Think about\add* how much our Father loves us! He allows us to ◄say that we are/be called► his children!
\add And it is indeed true that\add* we are \add his children. But people
in\add* the world \f + \fk metonymy \f* \add who are unbelievers\add* have not understood
\add who\add* God \add is\add*. So they do not understand \add who we
are\add*, that we \add are God's children\add*. 
\v 2 Dear friends, even though ◄at present/now► we are God's children,
\add he\add* has not yet ◄made clear/revealed► \add to us\add* what we will be like
\add in the future\add*. However, we know that when \add Christ\add* comes back again, we will be like him, because we will see
what he is \add really\add* like. 
\v 3  \add So\add*, all those who confidently expect \add to see\add*
\add Christ as he actually is/what Christ is like when he returns\add* must keep themselves pure in every way, just like
Christ, who is pure in every way. 
\v 4 But everyone who continues sinning is refusing to obey \add God's\add* laws, because that is what sin is, refusing to obey
\add God's\add* laws. 
\v 5 You know that Christ came in order to completely remove \add the guilt
of\add* our sins. You know also that he never sinned. 
\v 6 Those who continue \add doing what\add* Christ wants them to, do not continue sinning repeatedly. But those who repeatedly
sin have not understood \add who Christ is\add*, nor have they had a close relationship with him.
\v 7  \add So I urge you\add* who are very dear to me, do not let anyone deceive you
\add by telling you that it is all right to sin\add*. If you continue doing what is right, you are righteous, just like Christ
is righteous. 
\v 8  \add But\add* if anyone continues sinning, he is like the devil, because the devil has always been sinning since
\add the world\add* \f + \fk metonymy \f* began. \add And\add* the reason why God's Son became a human being was to destroy what the devil has
done. 
\v 9 People do not continue sinning repeatedly if they have become children of God. Instead,
\add they\add* continue \add to conduct their lives according to the good life and character/nature that God produced in
them\add* \f + \fk metaphor \f*. They cannot continually sin because God has caused them to become his children.
\v 10 Those who are God's children are clearly different from those who are ◄the devil's/Satan's► children.
\add The way that we can know who are Satan's children is this\add*: Those who do not do what is right are not God's children.
\add Specifically\add*, those who do not love their fellow believers are not
\add God's children Instead, they are Satan's children\add*. 
\s 1 John 3:11-18 
\s Because we have been changed from being spiritually dead people to being spiritually alive people, we should love each other
genuinely by helping our fellow believers who are in need. 
\p
\v 11 The message that you heard when you first \f + \fk metonymy \f* \add believed in
Christ\add* is that we should love each other. 
\v 12  \add We should\add* not \add hate others\add* as did \add Adam's
son\add*, Cain, who belonged to \add Satan\add*, the evil one. \add Because Cain hated his younger
brother\add*, he murdered him. ◄I will tell you about why he murdered his brother./Do you know why he murdered his brother
\f + \fk rhetorical question \f*?► It was because Cain habitually conducted his life in an evil way, and
\add he hated his younger brother\add* because his \add younger\add* brother
\add conducted his life\add* righteously. 
\v 13 You should not be amazed/surprised, my fellow believers, when
\add unbelievers\add* \f + \fk metonymy \f* hate you. 
\v 14 We know that we have been changed from \add being spiritually\add* dead \f + \fk metaphor \f* to
\add being spiritually\add* alive. We know this because we love our fellow believers.
\add Those who\add* do not love \add their fellow believers\add* are still
\add spiritually\add* \f + \fk metaphor \f* dead. 
\v 15 Those who hate \add any of\add* their fellow believers, \add God
considers\add* \f + \fk metaphor \f* them \add to be\add* murderers. And you know that no murderer has eternal life.
\v 16 The way that we now know \add how to truly\add* love \add our fellow believers is by
remembering\add* that Christ ◄voluntarily died/gave his life► for us. So,
\add when any of\add* our fellow believers \add need something, we should be willing to help them. We should even be willing
to\add* die for them. 
\v 17 Many \add of us\add* have the things that are necessary for us to live in this world. If we become aware that any of our
fellow believers do not have what they need and \add if we\add* refuse to
◄\add provide for them/give to them what they need\add*►, it is clear that we do not love God
\add as we claim/say that we do\add*. 
\v 18  \add I say to\add* you whom I love dearly, let us not merely say \f + \fk metonymy \f* that
\add we love our fellow believers!\add* Let us genuinely/really love them by doing things
\add to help them!\add* 
\s 1 John 3:19-24 
\s We must believe in God's Son and love each other in order to be confident that we have a close relationship with God and
that we will receive what we ask from him. 
\p
\v 19 By means of \add truly loving our fellow believers\add*, we can be sure that we are
\add conducting our lives according to\add* the true message. \add As a
result\add*, we will not feel guilty/ashamed \add when we talk\add* \f + \fk metonymy \f* to God.
\v 20  \add We can pray confidently\add*, because \add although\add* we might feel guilty/ashamed
\add about our sins\add*, God is ◄greater/more worthy to be trusted► than what we feel. He knows everything
\add about us\add*. 
\v 21 Dear friends, when we do not feel guilty \add because of our
sins\add*, we can pray to God confidently. 
\v 22 And, when we confidently pray to him and request \add something from
him\add*, we receive it because we do what he commands \add us to
do\add*, and because we do what pleases him. 
\v 23  \add I will tell you\add* what he commands \add us to do\add*:
\add We must\add* believe that Jesus Christ is ◄his Son/the one who is also God►.
\add We must\add* also love each other, just like he commanded \add us to
do\add*. 
\v 24 Those who do what God commands are ones who have a close relationship with God, and God has a close relationship with
them. \add I will tell you how\add* we can be sure that God has a close relationship with us: It is because
\add we have\add* his Spirit, whom he gave to us, that we can be sure that God has a close relationship with us.
