\v 1  \add I, John, am writing to you about\add* the one who existed before
\add there was anything else!\add* He is the one whom we \add apostles\add* listened to
\add as he taught us!\add* We saw him! We ourselves looked at him and touched him!
\add He is the one who taught us\add* the message that \add enables people to have
eternal\add* life \f + \ft (OR, live \add spiritually\add*) \f*. 
\v 2 Because he came here \add to the earth\add* and we have seen him, we proclaim to you clearly that the one whom we have
seen is the \add one who\add* has always lived. He was \add previously\add* with his Father in heaven, but he came to live
among us. 
\v 3 We proclaim to you the \add message about Jesus\add*, the one whom we saw and heard, in order that you may have a close
relationship with us. The ones whom we have a close relationship with are God our Father and his Son Jesus Christ.
\v 4 I am writing to you about these things so that \add you ◄will be
convinced\f + \ft Or: believe \f*\add*► \add that they are true, and as a\add* result we may be completely joyful.
\s 1 John 1:5-2:2 
\s We should continue to be morally pure, because God is morally pure and he is able to forgive our sins on the basis that
Jesus died to acquit us of the guilt of all our sins. 
\p
\v 5 The message that we heard from Christ and proclaim to you is this: God is
\add pure in every way. He never sins. He is like\add* \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* a \add brilliant\add* light that has no darkness at all.
\v 6 If we claim to have a close relationship with \add God\add*, but
\add we conduct our lives in an impure manner, that is like\add* living \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* in
\add evil\add* darkness. We are lying. We are not conducting our lives according to
\add God's\add* true message. 
\v 7 But living\add in a pure manner\add*, as God is \add living in a pure
manner\add* \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* \add in every way, is like living\add* in God's light. If we do that, we have a close relationship with each
other. Not only that, but \add God\add* ◄acquits us\f + \ft Or: removes \f* \add the
guilt\add*► \add of\add* all our sins because \add he accepts\add* what his Son Jesus did for us
\add when his\add* blood \add flowed from his body when he died. So we should conduct our
lives\add* ◄\add according to God's standard of purity\f + \ft Or: in \f* a pure manner according to what God says is
pure\add*►. 
\v 8 Those who never behave sinfully are deceiving themselves, and refusing
\add to accept as\add* true \add what God says about them\add*. 
\v 9 But God will do what he says that he will do, and what he does
is\add always\add* right. So, if we confess to him that we \add have
behaved\add* sinfully, he will forgive \add us for\add* our sins and ◄will free us from\f + \ft Or: remove \f*►
\add the guilt of\add* all our sins. \add Because of that\add*, \add we should confess to him that we have behaved
sinfully\add*. 
\v 10  \add Because God says that everyone has sinned\add*, those who say\f + \ft Or: claim \f* that they have never behaved sinfully talk
\add as though\add* God lies! They reject what God says \add about
us!\add*
