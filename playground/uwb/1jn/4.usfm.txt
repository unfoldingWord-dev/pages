\s 1 John 4:1-6 
\s Continue to test the teachings you hear to know whether or not they are from God. You should test those who teach them by
whether or not they acknowledge that Jesus Christ came in human form and also by what kind of people listen to that kind of
teaching. 
\p
\v 1 Dear friends, many people \add who have a false message\add* are teaching it to people \f + \ft metonymy \f*. So do not trust every
\add message that someone claims\f + \ft Or: says \f* that God's\add* Spirit \f + \ft metonymy \f*
\add gave to him\add*. Instead, test\f + \ft Or: think carefully about \f* the teachings that
\add you hear\add* in order to know whether they are from God or not.
\v 2  \add I will tell\add* you how to recognize \add teachings that come
from\add* the Spirit of God: Those who affirm\f + \ft Or: say \f* that Jesus Christ came
\add from God\add* to become a human \add like us\add* are \add teaching a
message\add* that is from God. 
\v 3 But those who do not affirm\f + \ft Or: say \f* \add that about\add* Jesus are not
\add teaching a message\add* from God. \add They are teachers who\add* oppose Christ. You have heard that people like that are
coming \add to be among us\add*. Even now they are already here!
\p
\v 4 As for you who are very dear to me, you belong to God, and you have refused
\add the false messages\add* that those people \add teach\add*, because
\add God\add*, who enables you \add to do what he wants\add*, is greater\f + \ft Or: more powerful \f* than
\add Satan\f + \ft Or: the devil\add* \f*, who enables godless people\f + \ft Or: people who conduct their lives in a way that displeases God \f* \f + \ft metonymy \f*.
\v 5 As for \add those who are teaching what is false\add*, they are godless people\f + \ft Or: people whose lives are displeasing to God \f*
\f + \ft metonymy \f*. Because of that, they teach what godless people\f + \ft Or: people whose lives are displeasing to God \f* \f + \ft metonymy \f* want to hear. That is
why the godless people\f + \ft Or: people whose lives displease God \f* \f + \ft metonymy \f* listen to them.
\v 6 As for us\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add*, \add because\add* we belong to God, whoever knows\f + \ft Or: has a close relationship with \f* God listens to
us. \add But\add* those who do not belong to God do not listen to us. That is how we can know whether
\add the things that people are teaching\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* are true or whether they are false, and deceiving
\add people\add*. 
\s 1 John 4:7-11 
\s We must love each other. God shows us what real love is. 
\p
\v 7 Dear friends, we must love each other, because God \add enables
us\add* to love \add each other\add*, and because those who love
\add their fellow believers\add* have become God's children and know\f + \ft Or: have a close relationship with \f* him.
\v 8 God's \add nature\add* is to love \add all people\add*. So those who do not love
\add their fellow believers\add* do not know\f + \ft Or: have a relationship with \f* God.
\v 9 I will tell you how God has shown us \add that he\add* loves us: He sent his only Son\f + \ft Or: the only one who was also God \f*
\add to live\add* on the earth to enable us to live \add eternally\add* as a result of
\add our trusting in what\add* he \add accomplished for us by dying for
us\add*. 
\v 10  \add And God\add* has shown \add us what it means to\add* love
\add another person\add*: \add It does\add* not \add mean\add* that we loved God, but
\add it means\add* that God loved us and sent his Son\f + \ft Or: the one who was also God \f* to sacrifice
\add his life\add* in order that \add our sins might be forgiven\add*
{\add he might forgive\add* our sins}. 
\v 11 Dear friends, since God loves us like that, we certainly ought to love each other!
\s 1 John 4:12-21 
\s In order to be assured that we are conducting our lives according to God's character, we must love God and our fellow
believers, because God loved us first. 
\p
\v 12 No one has ever seen God. \add Nevertheless\add*, if we love each other,
\add it is evident that\add* God lives within us and that we love others just like he
\add intends\f + \ft Or: wants \f* us to do\add*. 
\v 13  \add I will tell you\add* how we can be sure that we have a close relationship with God and that God is within us: He
has put his Spirit within us. 
\v 14 We \add apostles\add* have seen God's Son\f + \ft Or: the one who is also God \f*, and
\add we tell people\add* that the Father sent him to save \add the people
in\add* the world \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add from being punished for their sins\add*.
\v 15  \add So\add* those who affirm\f + \ft Or: say \f* that Jesus is the Son of\f + \ft Or: one who is also \f* God, God is within them, and they have a
close relationship with God. 
\v 16 We have experienced how God loves us and we believe that he loves us.
\add As a result, we love others. Because\add* God's \add nature\add* is to love people, those who continue to love
\add others\add* have a close relationship with God, and God has a close relationship with them.
\v 17 We \add should\add* love others completely. And if we do that, when the time comes for
\add him to\add* judge us, we will be confident \add that he will not condemn
us\add* (OR\add , that we have a close relationship with him\add*).
\add We will be confident of that\add* because of our \add conducting our
lives\add* in this world as Christ did. 
\v 18 We will not be afraid \add of God\add* if we \add truly\add* love
\add him\add*, because those who love \add God\add* completely cannot possibly be afraid
\add of him\add*. \add We would be\add* afraid only \add if we thought that he
would\add* punish us. So those who are afraid \add of God certainly\add* are not loving
\add God\add* completely. 
\v 19 We love \add God and our fellow believers\add* because God loved us first.
\v 20  \add So\add* those who say "I love God" but hate a fellow believer are lying. Those who do not love one of their fellow
believers, whom they have seen, certainly cannot be loving God, whom they have not seen.
\v 21 Keep in mind that this is what God has commanded us: If we love him, we must also love our fellow believers.
