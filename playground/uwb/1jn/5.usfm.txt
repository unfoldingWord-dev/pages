\c 5  
\s 1 John 5:1-5 
\s Those who believe that Jesus is God's Chosen One are people who have been caused to live spiritually, and they love their
fellow believers. They obey God's commands and overcome the evils of human society.
\p
\v 1 All those who believe that Jesus is the ◄Messiah/person God sent
\add to rescue us\add*► are ones who \add have truly\add* become children of God. And everyone who loves
\add a man who is\add* someone's father will \add be expected to\add* love that man's children as well.
\add Similarly, those who love God, who has caused them to become his
children\add* [MET], \add should love their fellow believers, whom God has also caused to become his
children\add*. 
\v 2 The way we can be sure that we \add truly\add* love God's children is this: We are loving them when we love God and do
what he commands \add us to do\add*. 
\v 3  \add I say this\add* because our obeying what God commands
\add us to do\add* is\add the same as\add* loving him. And it is not burdensome/difficult for
\add us to do\add* what God commands \add us to do\add*. 
\v 4 All of us whom God has caused to become his children have been able to successfully resist ◄doing what/conducting our
lives like► the people [MTY] \add who\add* oppose God do. It is \add only\add* by our trusting
\add in Christ\add* that we are able to ◄resist doing what/conducting our lives like► people in the world who are opposed to
God [MTY] do. 
\v 5 ◄\add I will tell you\add* who are the ones who are able to resist doing what the people who are opposed to God do./Do you
know who are the ones who are able to resist conducting their lives like the people who are opposed to God [MTY] do? [RHQ]► It
is those who believe that Jesus is ◄God's Son/the man who is also God►.
\s 1 John 5:6-12 
\s Jesus came from God to earth. Those who believe in and live united to him have eternal life.
\p
\v 6  \add Think about\add* Jesus Christ. He is the one who came
\add to earth from God\add*. \add God showed that he had truly sent Jesus when Jesus was
baptized\add* in water [MTY] and \add when Jesus'\add* blood \add flowed from his body when he
died\add*. \add God showed this\add* not only \add when Jesus was
baptized\add* [MTY], but also when Jesus' blood flowed \add from his body when he
died\add*. And \add God's\add* Spirit declares \add truthfully that Jesus Christ came from
God\add*. The Spirit always \add speaks what\add* is true. 
\v 7 There are three \add things\add* by which we know\add that Christ came from
God\add*. 
\v 8  \add Those three things are: What God's\add* Spirit \add tells us, what God said when Jesus was
baptized\add* [MTY] \add in/with\add* water, and \add Jesus'\add* blood
\add that flowed from his body when he died on the cross\add*. These three things all tell us the same thing,
\add that Jesus came from God\add*. 
\v 9 We \add usually\add* believe what \add other\add* people say. But what God says is more
\add reliable/trustworthy than what people say\add*. So \add we must
believe\add* what God has said is true \add about\add* ◄his Son/the one who is also God►.
\v 10 Those who trust in the Son of God know within their ◄inner beings/hearts► that
\add what God\add* says \add about his Son is true. But\add* those who refuse to believe that
\add what\add* God says is true are saying that God is a liar, because they refuse to believe what God has said about ◄his
Son/the one who is also God►. 
\v 11 This is what \add God\add* says \add to us\add*: “I have given you eternal life!” We will live forever if we have a close
relationship with his Son. 
\v 12 Those who have \add a close relationship with God's\add* Son (OR, who have accepted what God's Son
\add has done for them\add*) have \add already\add* begun to live
\add forever\add*. \add But\add* those who do not have a relationship with ◄God's Son/the one who is also God► (OR, who have
not accepted what God's Son has done for them) have not begun\add to\add* live
\add forever\add*. 
\s 1 John 5:13-21 
\s We have a close relationship with God because we are united to his Son. Because of that relationship, we have eternal life.
\p
\v 13 I have written this \add letter\add* to you who believe that Jesus is [MTY] ◄God's Son/the one who is also God► in order
that you may know that you have eternal life. 
\v 14 Because we have a close relationship with him, we are very confident that he hears us when we ask him
\add to do anything\add* that is in accordance with ◄his will/what he desires►.
\v 15  \add And\add* since we know that he hears whenever we ask
\add him for something\add*, we \add also\add* know that \add it is as
though\add* he has \add already\add* done what we requested him \add to
do\add*. 
\p
\v 16 Those who see one of their fellow believers sinning in a way that does not result in eternal separation from God should
ask \add God to help that fellow believer\add*; and \add as a result
God\add* will help that fellow believer and enable him or her to live
\add eternally. But some people\add* sin \add in a manner that causes
them\add* to be separated from God eternally. I am not saying that
\add you should\add* ask \add God to help\add* people who sin like that.
\v 17 Everyone who does what is wrong is sinning, but there are some sins that do not cause a person to be separated from God
eternally. 
\v 18 We know that if a person has new life from God [MET], that person does not continue sinning. Instead, the ◄Son of/one who
is also► God protects him so that \add Satan\add*, the evil one, does not harm him
\add spiritually\add*. 
\v 19 We know that we belong to God, and \add we know\add* that the evil one controls all
\add the evil people in\add* [MTY] the world. 
\v 20 We also know that ◄God's Son/the one who is also God► has come
\add to us\add*, and \add we know\add* that he has enabled us to know God, the one who is really/truly God. So now we have a
close relationship with \add God because\add* we belong to Jesus Christ, the one who is the ◄Son of/man who is also► God. Jesus
Christ is truly God, and \add he is the one who enables us to have\add* eternal life.
\p
\v 21  \add I say to\add* you who are very dear to me, guard/keep yourselves from
\add worshipping\add* gods \add that have no real power\add*!
