\v 1 You who are very dear to me, I am writing this to you \add to
say\add*, ‘Do not sin!’ But if any of you \add believers\add* sins,
\add God can forgive you because\add* we have Jesus Christ, who is the righteous one, who speaks to the Father on our behalf
\add and asks him to forgive us\add*. 
\v 2  \add Remember that Jesus Christ\add* voluntarily sacrificed
\add his own life for us, so that as a result God forgives\add* our sins.
\add Yes, God is able to forgive\add* our sins, but not only ours!
\add He is\add* also\add able to forgive\add* the sins of people everywhere!
\s 1 John 2:3-6 
\s We should conduct our lives as Christ did, obeying what God commands us to do. We will then be loving God in the manner in
which he wants us to. 
\p
\v 3  \add I will tell you\add* how we can be sure that we know\f + \ft Or: have a close relationship with \f*
\add God\add*. \add If we\add* obey what he commands \add us to do, that shows us that we have a close relationship with him.
So we must always obey what he commands us to do\add*. 
\v 4 Those who say, “We know\f + \ft Or: I have a close relationship with \f* God,” and do not obey what
\add God\add* commands \add us to do\add*, are liars. They are not conducting their lives according to
\add God's\add* true message. 
\v 5 But those who obey what \add God\add* commands them to do are the people who love God in the manner in which he wants us
to. \add I will tell you\add* how we can be sure that we have a close relationship with God:
\v 6 If we say that we are living as God wants us to, we should \add conduct our
lives\add* as Christ \add did\add*. 
\s 1 John 2:7-11 
\s We ought to love our fellow believers in order to continue behaving like people living in the light.
\p
\v 7 Dear friends, I am not writing a new \add additional\add* command to you. Instead, I am writing to you a command which you
have had since you first \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add believed in Christ\add*. That command is
\add part of\add* the message that you have \add always\add* heard.
\v 8 Nevertheless, \add I can say that\add* the command I am writing to you is a new command.
\add It is new because\add* what Christ \add did\add* was new, and what you
\add are doing\add* is new, because \add you have been ceasing to conduct your lives in a morally impure
manner\add* and \add are now truly conducting your lives in a pure manner. That is
like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* no longer \add living in\add* darkness. Instead,
\add it is like\add* living where a brilliant light is already shining.
\v 9 Those who claim that they are \add pure in every way, like people\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* living in the light, but hate any of their
fellow believers, are still \add behaving in an impure manner, like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*
\add people who are continually living\add* in darkness. 
\v 10 But those who love their fellow believers \add are continuing to conduct their lives like
people\add* who are living in the light. They are people who please
\add God\add* \f + \ft litotes \f*\add . So you should love your fellow believers\add*.
\v 11 But those who hate any of their fellow believers are still
\add conducting their lives in an impure way, like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add people who are
living\add* in darkness. They do not know that they will eventually destroy themselves
\add eternally\add*. They have become \add spiritually\add* blind \f + \ft personification, metaphor \f*,
\add unaware of spiritual truth\add*. 
\s 1 John 2:12-14 
\s I am writing all these matters to you because I know that God has forgiven your sins and also because you have come to know
the Father and Christ, who has always existed, and because you have overcome the evil one.
\p
\v 12-13 I am writing \add this\add* to you \add whom I love as though\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*
\add you were my\add* little children, to you who are \add spiritually mature people who are
like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* fathers, and to you \add spiritually vigorous\f + \ft Or: strong \f* people who are
like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* young men. Remember that your sins have been forgiven
{\add God\add* has forgiven your sins} on account of what Christ \f + \ft metonymy \f*
\add has done\add*. You now know \add Christ, the one\add* who always existed. You have defeated the evil one,
\add Satan\add*. 
\v 14  \add I will say it again\add*: I have written \add this\add* to you because you have come to know the Father, because
you now know \add Christ, the one\add* who always existed, because you are
\add spiritually\add* strong, because you continue to \add obey\add* God's word, and because you have defeated the evil one,
\add Satan\add*. 
\s 1 John 2:15-17 
\s Do not esteem the evil manner in which other people in the world live, since you want to live forever.
\p
\v 15 Do not desire \add to conduct you lives in the evil manner in
which\add* godless \add people in\add* the world \f + \ft metonymy \f* conduct their
\add lives\add*, and do not love anything that \add the evil people\add* in the world \f + \ft metonymy \f*
\add consider to be good\add*. Those who desire\add to conduct their lives in the evil manner in which other people
of\add* the world \f + \ft metonymy \f* conduct their \add lives\add* do not \add really\add* love
\add God\add*, their Father, \add at all\add*. 
\v 16 Keep in mind that all \add the evil human desires\add* in the world
\add are actions\f + \ft Or: things \f* such as these\add*: \add People\add* desire to do
\add what\add* their self-directed nature \add strongly desires\add*.
\add People\add* desire \add to possess\add* whatever appeals to their senses\f + \ft Or: they see or hear about \f*.
\add People\add* boast about the material things that they possess.
\add Such evil ways of living\add* do not originate\f + \ft Or: come \f* from the Father! Instead they originate\f + \ft Or: come \f* from
\add the godless people in\add* the world\f + \ft Or: people in the world who conduct their lives in a manner that displeases God \f* \f + \ft metonymy \f*!
\v 17 The \add godless people in\add* the world \f + \ft metonymy \f*, along with what they desire, will disappear, but those who do what God
wants \add them to do\add* will live forever! 
\s 1 John 2:18-25 
\s You know that it is now the final period of this age when there are liars who deny that Jesus is God's Chosen One. But you
have the power of God's Spirit and you know what is true and what is false. So continue to live according to the true message
that you heard when you began to believe in Christ, in order that you may continue to live united both to God's Son and to the
Father. 
\p
\v 18  \add You who are very dear to me\add*, it is \add now\add* the final part \f + \ft metonymy \f*
\add of this age\f + \ft Or:  \f*\add*the final \add period of time before Jesus
returns\add*. Just like you heard \add from us apostles\add* that a person who opposes Christ will come\f + \ft Or: appear \f*, even now there
are many people who oppose Christ. That is why we know that it is the final part
\add of this age\add* \f + \ft Or: \add before Jesus returns\add* \f* \f + \ft metonymy \f*.
\v 19 The \add people who oppose Christ\add* refused to remain in our congregations, but they never
\add really\add* belonged with us\f + \ft Or: were fellow believers►. If they had ◄belonged with us, Or: been fellow believers \f*, they would
have remained with us. But because \add they left, everyone\add* can clearly know that none of them ◄belongs with us\f + \ft Or: is \f* a
fellow believer►. 
\v 20 But as for you, you have been given the power of \add God's Spirit, which comes from
Christ\add* \f + \ft Or: \add God\add* \f*, the Holy One. \add As a result\add*, you all know
\add how to\add* ◄\add distinguish false teaching from\f + \ft Or: recognize \f* what is false teaching and what
is\add*► \add the true message\add*. 
\v 21 I am writing \add this letter\add* to you, not because you do not know
\add what is God's\add* true message, but because you do know \add what it
is\add*. You also know that no false message originates\f + \ft Or: comes \f* from
\add God, who is the source of all\add* truth. 
\v 22 The \add worst\add* liars are the ones who deny that Jesus is the Messiah\f + \ft Or: the one whom God chose to rescue us \f*. They are
\add the ones that we told you about\add*, the ones who oppose Christ. They refuse to acknowledge\f + \ft Or: admit \f* that
\add God is\add* the Father and that \add Jesus is his\add* Son \f + \ft Or: the one who is also God \f*.
\v 23 Those who refuse to acknowledge\f + \ft Or: admit \f* that \add Jesus is God's\add* Son do not have a relationship with the Father. But
those who acknowledge\f + \ft Or: admit \f* that \add Jesus is God's\add* Son \add not only have a relationship with God's Son, but
they\add* have a relationship with the Father also. 
\v 24  \add So\add*, as for you, you must continue to conduct your lives according to
\add the true message\add* that you heard when you began \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add to believe in
Christ\add*. If you continue to \add do that\add*, you will continue to have a close relationship with both
\add God's\add* Son and the Father. 
\v 25 And what God told us is that \add he will cause us\add* to live forever!
\s 1 John 2:26-27 
\s Continue to conduct your lives according to what you were originally taught by God's Spirit.
\p
\v 26 I have written this to you \add to\add* \add warn you\add* about\f + \ft Or: tell you to beware of \f* those
\add who want to\add* deceive you \add concerning the truth about
Christ\add*. 
\v 27 As for you, God's Spirit, whom you received from Christ, remains in you. So you do not need anyone to teach you
\add anything else that they claim\f + \ft Or: say \f* is the truth\add*. God's Spirit is teaching you all
\add of God's truth that you need to know\add*. God's Spirit is truthful and never says anything that is false. So continue to
conduct your lives in the way that \add he has\add* taught you. 
\s 1 John 2:28-29 
\s Continue to live united to Christ, so that you will be confident that he will accept you when he returns.
\p
\v 28 Now, \add while some people are trying to persuade you to accept their false teaching, I
urge\add* you who are very dear to me to continue to \add have a close relationship
with\add* Christ. \add We need to do that\add* in order that we may be confident
\add that he will accept us\add* when he comes back again. If we do that, we will not be ashamed
\add when we stand\add* before \add him\add* when he comes. 
\v 29 Since you know that \add Christ\add* always does what is right, you know that all those who continue doing what is right
are the ones who have become children of God.
