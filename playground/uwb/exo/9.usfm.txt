\c 9  
\s Yahweh sent a terrible disease to afflict the Egyptians' livestock
\p
\v 1 Then Yahweh said to Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f*, "Go to the king and say to him, 'This is what Yahweh, the one
\add we\add* Hebrews \add worship\add*, says: "Allow my people to go, in order that they may worship me.
\v 2 If you still refuse to let them go \f + \ft doublet \f*, 
\v 3 I warn you that I will punish you with my power \f + \ft metonymy \f* by sending a terrible disease on all your animals—on your horses,
donkeys, camels, on your cattle, and on your flocks \add of sheep and
goats\add*. 
\v 4 But I, Yahweh, will distinguish between \add what I do to\add* the animals that belong to the Israeli people and
\add what I do to\add* your animals. The result will be that no animal that belongs to the Israeli people will die." '
\v 5  \add Tell him that\add* I have determined\f + \ft Or: decided \f* that tomorrow is the day that I will do this in this land."
\p
\v 6 The next day Yahweh did just what he said \add that he would
do\add*. A terrible disease afflicted all of the Egyptians' animals, and many of them \f + \ft hyperbole \f* died. But none of the Israeli
people's animals died. 
\v 7 The king sent \add men to investigate\add*, and they were surprised
\add to see\add* that none of the Israeli people's animals had died. But
\add after they reported that to the\add* king, he continued to be stubborn [IDI], and he did not let the
\add Israeli\add* people go. 
\s Yahweh caused the Egyptian people to be afflicted with boils 
\p
\v 8 Then Yahweh said to Aaron and Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f*, "Take a few handfuls of ashes\f + \ft Or: soot \f* from a furnace\f + \ft Or: an oven where they burn lime \f*,
and let Moses throw them up into the air, in front of the king. 
\v 9 The \add ashes\f + \ft Or: soot \f*\add* will spread all over the country of Egypt like fine dust. And everywhere the ashes\f + \ft Or: soot \f* will
cause boils to afflict both the Egyptian people and their animals, all over the land."
\v 10 So they both got some ashes\f + \ft Or: soot \f* and \add went and\add* stood in front of the king. Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* threw the ashes\f + \ft Or: soot \f* up into
the air. The ashes\f + \ft Or: soot \f* spread all over, causing boils to afflict the
\add Egyptian\add* people and their animals. All the boils became open sores.
\v 11 Even the men who worked magic had boils. The result was that they were not able to come to \f + \ft Or: oppose \f* Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f*, because
the men who worked magic had boils just like all \add the rest of\add* the Egyptian people.
\v 12 But Yahweh caused the king to \add continue to\add* be stubborn [IDI]. He did not pay any attention to what they\f + \ft Or: we \f*
\add said\add*, just as Yahweh had told Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f* \add would happen\add*.
\s Yahweh sent hail on all the Egyptian people and their animals
\p
\v 13 Then Yahweh said to Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f*, "Get up early \add tomorrow\add* morning. Go and stand in front of the king and tell him
that Yahweh God, the one that the Hebrew people \add worship\add*, says this: 'Let my people go, in order that they may worship
me \add in the desert\add*. 
\v 14  \add If you do not let them go\add*, this time I will \add punish\add* with plagues
\add not only\add* your officials and the rest of your people, but I will punish you yourself \f + \ft synecdoche \f*, in order that you will
know there is no \add god\add* like me anywhere in the world. 
\v 15 By this time I could have used my power \f + \ft metonymy \f* to strike you and your people with terrible diseases that would have wiped
you all from the earth. 
\v 16 But I have let you live. The reason I have let you live is to show you my power, with the result that
\add people\add* all over the earth \f + \ft hyperbole \f* will know how great I \f + \ft metonymy \f* am.
\v 17 You are still acting proudly and refusing to let my people go.
\v 18 So listen \add to this:\add* about this time tomorrow I will cause very heavy hail to fall
\add in Egypt\add*. From the time Egypt first became \add a country\add*, there has never been a hailstorm
\add as bad as this one will be\add*. 
\v 19 So you should send \add a message\add* \add to everyone\add* to put their cattle, and everything else that they own that
is \add out\add* in the fields, under shelters. The hail will fall on every person and every animal that is out in the fields
and that is not brought under a shelter, and they will all die.' "
\add So Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* did what Yahweh said\add*. 
\p
\v 20 Some of the king's officials who heard what Yahweh had said became very afraid. So they brought all their animals and
their slaves under shelters. 
\v 21 But those who did not pay any attention to what Yahweh had said left their slaves and their animals in the fields.
\v 22 Then Yahweh said to Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f*, "Raise your hand up toward the sky, in order that hail will fall all over the land of
Egypt—on the people and on their animals and on all the plants in the fields."
\v 23 So Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* lifted his\f + \ft Or: my \f* stick up toward the sky. And Yahweh sent down hail, all over the land of Egypt. There was also
thunder and lightning. 
\v 24 While very heavy hail was falling, there was thunder, and lightning struck the ground. There had never been a hailstorm
like that since Egypt first became a country. 
\v 25 The hail struck everything that was in the fields all over Egypt—every person and every animal. The hail destroyed the
plants in the fields and stripped \add the leaves off\add* the trees.
\v 26 Only in Goshen region, where the Israeli people were \add living\add*, was there no hail.
\p
\v 27 Then the king sent \add someone\add* to summon Aaron and Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f*. He said to them\f + \ft Or: us \f*, "This time
\add I admit that\add* I have sinned. What Yahweh \add has done\add* is right, and what I and my people
\add have done\add* is wrong. 
\v 28 Pray to\f + \ft Or: Plead with \f* Yahweh! \add We\add* cannot \add endure any
more\add* of this thunder and hail! I will let your people go; they do not have to stay
\add in Egypt\add* any longer." 
\p
\v 29 Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* replied, "As soon as I go out of this city, I will lift up my hands
\add and pray\add* to Yahweh. Then the thunder will cease, and no more hail
\add will fall\add*. \add This will happen\add* in order that you will know that Yahweh,
\add not your gods\add*, controls everything \add that happens\add* on the earth.
\v 30 But as for you and your officials, I know that you do not yet fear Yahweh God."
\p
\v 31 When the hail fell, the flax was ruined because the buds were forming, and the barley was ruined because its grain was
ripe. 
\v 32 But none of the wheat was ruined, because its shoots were still very small.
\p
\v 33 So Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* left the king and went outside the city. He\f + \ft Or: I \f* lifted up his\f + \ft Or: my \f* hands toward Yahweh
\add and prayed\add*. Then the thunder and the hail stopped, and the rain also stopped falling on the land
\add of Egypt\add*. 
\v 34 But when the king saw that the rain and the hail and the thunder had stopped, he sinned again. He and his officials
continued to be stubborn [IDI]. 
\v 35 So, just as Yahweh had predicted by what he told Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f*, he did not allow the Israeli people to leave.
