\c 19  
\s Yahweh gave instructions to Moses at Sinai Mountain. 
\p
\v 1-2 The Israeli people then left Rephidim, and exactly two months after leaving Egypt, they/we came to the desert near Sinai
\add Mountain\add*. They/We set up their/our tents at the base of the mountain.
\v 3 Moses/I climbed up the mountain \add to talk with\add* God. Yahweh called to
\add him/me\add* from \add the top of\add* the mountain and said, “This is what I want you to say to the Israeli people, the
descendants of Jacob: 
\v 4 ‘You have seen what I did to the Egyptians. You have seen \add what I did for
you\add* and how I brought you here to me. It was as though I \add lifted you up
as\add* an eagle \add carries its young eaglets\add* on its wings \f + \fr metaphor \f*.
\v 5 So now, if you will do what I tell you and obey all that I command you, you will be my own people. All the people-groups
on the earth are mine, but you will be ◄dearer/more special► to me than all the other people-groups.
\v 6 You will be people over whom I will rule, and you will all ◄be like priests/represent me to other nations as priests
represent me to one nation► \f + \fr metaphor \f*, and you will be completely dedicated to me.’ That is what you must tell the Israeli people.”
\p
\v 7 So Moses/I went \add down the mountain\add* and summoned the elders/leaders of the people. He told them everything that
Yahweh had told him/me to tell them. 
\v 8 The people all said, “We will do everything that Yahweh has told us to do.” Then Moses/I
\add climbed back up the mountain and\add* reported to Yahweh what the people had said.
\p
\v 9 Then Yahweh said to Moses/me, “Listen carefully: I am going to appear to you from inside a thick cloud. When I am speaking
to you, the people will hear it, and they will always believe ◄\add that\add* you
\add are their leader/what\add* you \add tell them\add*►.” Then Moses/I went
\add down the mountain and reported to the people what Yahweh said. Then he/I went back up the mountain
and\add* told Yahweh what the people replied. 
\v 10 Then Yahweh said to Moses/me, “Go \add back down\add* to the people
\add again\add*. \add Tell them to\add* purify themselves today and tomorrow.
\add Tell them to\add* wash their clothes, too. 
\v 11 They must do that to be ready on the day after tomorrow. On that day I will come down to Sinai Mountain to where all the
people can see me. 
\v 12 You must make a boundary around the base of the mountain, and tell them, ‘Be sure that you do not climb the mountain or
even go near it. Anyone who even touches the base of the mountain must be executed.’
\v 13 Do not let anyone touch any person or any animal that touches the mountain. You must
\add kill any person or animal\add* \add that touches the mountain\add* by throwing stones at it or shooting it
\add with arrows\add*. But when you hear a long \add loud\add* trumpet sound, the people can come close to the
\add base of the\add* mountain.” 
\p
\v 14 So Moses/I went down the mountain \add again\add* and told the people to purify themselves. They did what Moses/I told
them to do, and they also washed their clothes. 
\v 15 Then Moses/I said to the people, “Be ready on the day after tomorrow. And
\add you men\add* must not have sex with \f + \fr euphemism \f* \add your wives\add* until after then.”
\p
\v 16 Two days later, during the morning, there was thunder and lightning, and a very dark cloud on the mountain. A trumpet
sounded very loudly, with the result that the people in the camp shook/trembled because they
\add were very afraid\add*. 
\v 17 Then Moses/I led the people outside the camp to meet with God. They stood around the base of the mountain.
\v 18 All of Sinai Mountain was covered in smoke, because Yahweh had descended on it, surrounded by a fire. The smoke rose up
like the smoke from \add the chimney of\add* a furnace, and the whole mountain shook violently.
\v 19 As the sound of the trumpet continued to become louder, Moses/I spoke
\add to Yahweh\add*, and Yahweh answered \add him/me\add* in \add a loud voice that sounded
like\add* thunder. 
\v 20 Then Yahweh came down \add again\add* onto the top of Sinai Mountain, and he summoned Moses/me to come up to the top of
the mountain. So Moses/I went up. 
\v 21 Yahweh said to Moses/me, “Go down again and warn the people not to cross the boundary in order to look
\add at me\add*. If they \add do\add* that, many of them will die.
\v 22 Also, the priests who habitually come near me must purify themselves. If they do not do that, I will punish them.”
\p
\v 23 Then Moses/I said to Yahweh, “The people will not climb the mountain, because you commanded them, saying, ‘Set a boundary
around the mountain, to make it sacred/taboo.’ ” 
\v 24 Yahweh replied, “Go down the mountain, and bring Aaron back up with you. But do not allow the priests or other people to
cross the boundary to come up to me. If they cross it, I will punish them.”
\v 25 So Moses/I went down the mountain \add again\add* and told the people
\add what Yahweh had said\add*.
