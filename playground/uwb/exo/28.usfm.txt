\s Instructions for the priests' clothing 
\p
\v 1 “Summon your \add older\add* brother Aaron and his sons—Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
◄\add Set them apart/They are the ones whom I have chosen\add*► from the
\add rest of\add* the Israeli people, in order that they can serve me
\add by being\add* priests. 
\v 2  \add Tell the people to\add* make beautiful clothes for Aaron, clothes that are
\add suitable for one who\add* has this dignified and sacred \add work\add*.
\v 3 Talk to all the skilled workmen, those to whom I have given special ability.
\add Tell them to\add* make clothes for Aaron, for him to wear when he is ◄set apart/dedicated►
\add to become\add* a priest to serve me. 
\v 4 These are the clothes that they are to make: a sacred pouch for Aaron to wear over his breast, a sacred apron, a robe, an
embroidered tunic/gown, a ◄turban/cloth to wrap around his head►, and a sash/waistband. These are the clothes that your
\add older\add* brother Aaron and his sons must wear as they serve me
\add by doing the work that\add* priests do. 
\v 5 The skilled workmen must use fine linen and blue, purple, and red yarn/thread to make these clothes.”
\s Instructions for the sacred apron 
\p
\v 6 “The skilled workmen must make the sacred apron from fine linen, and skillfully embroider it with blue, purple, and red
yarn/thread. 
\v 7 It must have two shoulder straps, to join the front part to the back part.
\v 8 A carefully-woven belt, which must be made from the same materials as the sacred apron, must be
\add sewn\add* onto the sacred apron. 
\v 9  \add A skilled workman\add* must take two \add expensive\add* onyx stones and engrave on them the names of the twelve
sons of Jacob. 
\v 10 He must engrave the names in the order in which Jacob's sons were born. He must engrave six names on one stone, and the
other six names on the other stone. 
\v 11 A gem-cutter should engrave these names on the stones. Then he should enclose the stones in ◄settings/tiny gold frames►.
\v 12 Then he should fasten the stones onto the shoulder straps \add of the sacred
apron\add*, to represent the twelve Israeli tribes. In that way, Aaron will carry the names of the tribes on his shoulders in
order that \add I\add*, Yahweh, will never forget \add my people\add* \f + \ft (OR, in order that
\add he will always\add* remember that \add those tribes belong to\add* Yahweh).
\v 13 The settings for the stones must be made from gold. 
\v 14  \add Tell them to\add* make two tiny chains that are braided like cords, and fasten the chains to the settings.”
\s Instructions for the sacred pouch 
\p
\v 15 “\add Tell the skilled workman to\add* make a sacred pouch for Aaron to wear over his chest/breast.
\add He will use the things he puts into the pouch\add* to determine
\add my answers to the questions he asks\add*. It must be made of the same materials as the sacred apron, and embroidered in
the same way. 
\v 16 It is to be square, and the material must be folded double, so that it is ◄9 in./22 cm.► on each side.
\v 17  \add The skilled workman must\add* fasten four rows of valuable stones onto the pouch. In the first row, he must put a
\add red\add* ruby, a \add yellow\add* topaz, and a \add red\add* garnet.
\v 18 In the second row, he must put a \add green\add* emerald, a
\add blue\add* sapphire, and a \add clear/white\add* diamond. 
\v 19 In the third row he must put a \add red\add* jacinth, a \add white\add* agate, and a
\add purple\add* amethyst. 
\v 20 In the fourth row, he must put a \add yellow\add* beryl, a
\add red\add* carnelian, and a \add green\add* jasper. 
\v 21 A gem-cutter should engrave on each of these twelve stones the name of one of the sons of Jacob. These names will
represent the twelve Israeli tribes. 
\v 22 The two \add chains\add* that are made from pure gold and braided like cords are for
\add attaching\add* the sacred pouch \add to the sacred apron\add*.
\v 23  \add The workman must\add* make two gold rings, and attach them to the upper corners of the sacred pouch.
\v 24  \add He must make\add* two gold cords, and fasten one end of each cord to one of the rings.
\v 25 He must fasten the other end of each cord to the two settings
\add that enclose the stones\add*. In that way, the sacred pouch will be attached to the shoulder straps of the sacred apron.
\v 26 Then \add he must\add* make two more gold rings, and attach them to the lower corners of the sacred pouch, on the inside
edges, next to the sacred apron. 
\v 27  \add He must\add* make two more gold rings, and attach them to the lower part of the front of the shoulder straps, near
to where \add the\add* \add shoulder straps\add* are joined \add to the sacred
apron\add*, just above the carefully-woven sash/waistband. 
\v 28 The skilled workman must tie the rings on the sacred pouch to the rings on the sacred apron with a blue cord, so that the
sacred pouch is above the sash/waistband and does not come loose from the sacred apron.
\v 29 In that way, Aaron will have the names of the twelve Israeli tribes in the sacred pouch close to his chest/breast when he
enters the Holy Place. This will remind him that I, Yahweh, \add will never forget my
people\add* (OR, \add that he represents my people when he talks to me,
Yahweh\add*) \f*. 
\v 30 Put into the sacred pouch the two things that the priest will use to determine my answers to the questions he asks. In
that way, they will be close to his chest/breast when he enters \add the Holy place to
talk\add* to me. He will use them to determine what is my will for the Israeli people.”
\s Instructions for other clothes for the priests 
\p
\v 31 “\add Tell them to\add* use only blue \add cloth\add* to make the robe that is to be worn underneath the priest's sacred
apron. 
\v 32 It is to have an opening through which \add the priest\add* can put his head. They must sew a border around this opening,
to keep the material from tearing. 
\v 33 At the lower edge on the robe, they must fasten \add decorations that look
like\add* pomegranate fruit. They must be \add woven from\add* blue, purple, and red yarn/thread.
\v 34 Between each of these decorations, they must fasten a tiny gold bell.
\v 35 When Aaron enters the Holy Place \add in the Sacred Tent\add* to do his work as a priest and when he leaves the Sacred
Tent, the bells will ring \add as he walks\add*. As a result, he will not die
\add because of disobeying my instructions\add*. 
\p
\v 36  \add Tell them to\add* make a tiny ornament of pure gold, and tell a ◄skilled workman/gem-cutter► to engrave on it the
words, ‘Dedicated to Yahweh.’ 
\v 37 They should fasten this ornament to the front of the turban by a blue cord.
\v 38 Aaron must always wear this on his forehead. In that way, Aaron himself will show
\add that he accepts\add* the guilt if the Israeli people offer \add their
sacrifices\add* to me in a way that is not correct, and I, Yahweh, will accept their sacrifices.
\p
\v 39  \add Tell them to\add* weave the long-sleeved tunic/gown from fine linen. Also they must make from fine linen a turban
and a sash/waistband, and embroider \add designs on it\add*. 
\p
\v 40  \add Tell them to\add* make beautiful long-sleeved tunics/gowns, sashes, waistbands, and caps for Aaron's sons. Make
ones that will be suitable for those who have this dignified work.
\v 41 Put these clothes on your \add older\add* brother Aaron and on his sons. Then ◄set them apart/dedicate them► for this
work by anointing them \add with olive oil\add*, in order that they may serve me
\add by being\add* priests. 
\v 42 Also \add tell them to\add* make linen undershorts for them. The undershorts should extend from their waists to their
thighs, in order that no one can see their private parts. 
\v 43 Aaron and his sons must always wear those undershorts when they enter the Sacred Tent or when they come near to the altar
to offer sacrifices in the Holy Place. If they do not obey this ritual, I will cause them to die. Aaron and all his male
descendants must obey this rule forever.”
