\s Instructions for the work for Bezalel and Oholiab 
\p
\v 1-2 Yahweh \add also\add* said to Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f*, “Note that I have chosen Bezalel, the son of Uri and grandson of Hur, from the
tribe of Judah. 
\v 3 I have caused him to be completely controlled\f + \ft Or: empowered \f* by my Spirit, and I have given him special ability
\add to make things\add* and have enabled him to know how to do very skilled work.
\v 4 He can engrave skillful designs in gold, silver, and bronze.
\v 5 He can cut jewels\f + \ft Or: valuable stones \f* and enclose them \add in tiny gold
settings\f + \ft Or: frames \f*\add*. He can carve things from wood and do other skilled work.
\v 6 Note that I have also appointed Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, from the tribe of Dan, to work with him. I have also given
special ability to other men, in order that they can make all the things that I have commanded you
\add to be made\add*. 
\v 7 That includes the Sacred Tent, the sacred chest and its lid, all the other things that will be inside the Sacred Tent,
\v 8 the table and all the things that are used with it, the pure gold lampstand and all the things that are used to take care
of it, the altar \add for burning\add* incense, 
\v 9 the altar for offering sacrifices that will be burned and all the things that will be used with it, the washbasin and its
base, 
\v 10 all the beautiful sacred clothes for Aaron and his sons to wear when they work as priests,
\v 11 the oil for anointing, and the sweet-smelling incense for the Holy Place.
\add The skilled workers\add* must make all these things exactly as I have told you that they should do.”
\s Instructions for the day of rest 
\p
\v 12 Yahweh also said to Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f*, 
\v 13 “Tell the Israeli people, ‘Obey my instructions regarding the rest days\f + \ft Or: Sabbath days \f*. Those days will remind you and me
\add and your descendants\add*, throughout all future generations, that I, Yahweh, have set you apart\f + \ft Or: chosen you \f* to be my
people. 
\v 14 You must obey \add my rules about\add* the rest days because they are holy\f + \ft Or: sacred \f*. Those who treat those days in an
irreverent way by working on those days must be executed \add to show
that\add* I no longer consider them to belong to my people. 
\v 15 You may work for six days \add each week\add*, but the seventh day
\add of each week\add* is a solemn rest day, dedicated to me, Yahweh. Anyone who does any work on a rest day is to be executed.
\v 16 You Israeli people must respect the rest day, and you \add and your
descendants\add* must celebrate it throughout all future generations.
\add It will remind you\add* of the agreement that I have made with you that will last forever.
\v 17 It will remind you Israeli people and remind me \add of that agreement
because\add* I, Yahweh, created the heavens and the earth in six days, and on the seventh day I stopped doing that work and
relaxed.’ ” 
\p
\v 18 When Yahweh finished talking with Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f* on the top of Sinai Mountain, he gave him\f + \ft Or: me \f* the two stone slabs on which he
had engraved his commandments with his own fingers.
