\c 3  
\s God talked to Moses from inside a burning bush, and told him to lead his people out of Egypt
\p
\v 1 Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* was taking care of the sheep that belonged to his\f + \ft Or: my \f* father-in-law Jethro, the priest of the Midian
\add people\add*. He\f + \ft Or: I \f* led the flock across the desert and came to Horeb,
\add the mountain\add* \add that was later called Sinai\add*, the ◄mountain that
\add was dedicated to\add* God\f + \ft Or: taboo \f* mountain►. 
\v 2  \add One day\add* Yahweh ◄appeared\f + \ft Or: revealed \f* himself► to him\f + \ft Or: me \f*,
\add looking like\add* an angel. The angel appeared as a flame of fire in the midst of a bush
\add that was burning\add*. Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* looked at it, and he was surprised that the bush was burning, but it was not burning up.
\v 3 Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* said, “I will go closer and try to see this strange sight! Why is the bush not burning up?”
\p
\v 4 When Yahweh saw that he\f + \ft Or: I \f* had come closer, he called to Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f* from the middle of the bush, saying, “Moses! Moses!” He\f + \ft Or: I \f*
replied, “\add Yes\add*, here I am.” 
\v 5 Yahweh said, “Do not come closer! \add Because I am God\add*, the ground on which you are standing is holy\f + \ft Or: taboo \f*. So take
off your sandals \add to show respect to me\add*.” 
\v 6 He said, “I am God, the one your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob
\add worship\add*.” So Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* covered his\f + \ft Or: my \f* face, because he\f + \ft Or: I \f* was afraid
\add that God would kill him if\add* he looked at God. 
\p
\v 7 Then Yahweh said, “I have seen how cruelly \add they are treating\add* my people in Egypt. I have heard them
◄wailing\f + \ft Or: crying \f* out► \add for help\add* because of what the slave-drivers
\add are forcing them to do\add*. I know how my people are suffering.
\v 8 So I have come down \add from heaven\add* to rescue them from the Egyptians \\f + \\ft synecdoche \\f*. I have come to bring them up from that
land \add to the highlands of Canaan\add*. I will bring them to a land that is good\f + \ft Or: fertile \f* and that has plenty of space. It
will be very good for raising livestock and growing crops \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f*. It is the land where the descendants of Canaan, Heth, Amor,
Periz, Hiv, and Jebus \add live\add*. 
\v 9 Truly I have now heard my Israeli people crying \\f + \\ft personification \\f*. I have seen how the Egyptians oppress them.
\v 10 So go \add back\add* to Egypt. I am sending you to the king, in order that
\add he may permit\add* you to bring my people, the Israeli people, out of Egypt.”
\p
\v 11 But Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* replied to God, “I have no status \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f*! ◄I cannot go to the king and
\add ask him to permit me\add* to bring the Israeli people out of Egypt!\f + \ft Or: How \f* can I go to the king and
\add ask him to allow me\add* to bring the Israeli people out of Egypt?►” \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f*
\v 12 He said, “I will be with you. And when you bring \add my\add* people out of Egypt, all of you will worship me
\add right\add* here on this mountain. That will prove that I am the one who sent you
\add to them\add*.” 
\p
\v 13 Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* said to God, “If I go to the Israeli people and say to them, ‘God, the one your ancestors
\add worshiped\add*, has sent me to you,’ and they ask me, ‘What is his name?’, what shall I say to them?”
\v 14 God replied to Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f*, “I am who I am.” And he said, “Tell the Israeli people that the one who is
\add named\add* ‘I am’ has sent me to you.” 
\p
\v 15 God also said to Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f*, “Say this to the Israeli people: ‘Yahweh God, the one your ancestors
\add worshiped\add*, the one that Abraham and Isaac and Jacob \add worship\add*, has sent me to you.’ This name,
\add Yahweh\add*, will be my name forever. That is the name that
\add people in\add* all future generations \add must use\add* \add when they talk
about\f + \ft Or: to \f*\add* me. 
\v 16 Go \add to Egypt\add* and gather together the elders\f + \ft Or: leaders \f* of the Israeli people, and say to them, ‘Yahweh God, the one
your ancestors \add worshiped\add*, the one Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob
\add worshiped\add*, appeared to me. He said to him\f + \ft Or: me \f*, “I have been watching closely what the Egyptian people have done to
you. 
\v 17 I promise that I will rescue you from being oppressed in Egypt, and
\add I will take you\add* to the land where the descendants of Canaan, Heth, Amor, Periz, Hiv, and Jebus
\add live\add*. It is a land good for raising livestock and growing crops \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f*.” ’
\v 18 My people will do what you say. Then you and the Israeli elders\f + \ft Or: leaders \f* will go to the king of Egypt, and you will say to
him, ‘Yahweh, who is God, the one we Hebrews \add worship\add*, has revealed himself to us. So now we ask you, allow us to
travel for three days to \add a place in\add* the desert, in order that there we may offer sacrifices to Yahweh, our God.’
\v 19 But I know that the king of Egypt will allow you to go only if he realizes I am
\add more\add* powerful \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* \add than he is\add*. 
\v 20 So I will use my power \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* to strike\f + \ft Or: punish \f* \add the people
of\add* Egypt \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* by performing many miracles there. Then he will allow you to leave.
\v 21  \add When that happens\add*, I will cause the people of Egypt to respect you.
\add The result will be that\add* when you leave Egypt, ◄you will not go empty-handed\f + \ft Or: they \f* will give you many
\add valuable\add* things to take with you►. 
\v 22  \add At that time\add*, each \add Israeli\add* woman will ask her
\add Egyptian\add* neighbor and each \add Egyptian\add* woman who is living in her \f + \ft (OR, her neighbor's) \f* house to
\add give her\add* some silver and gold jewelry and some \add nice\add* clothes.
\add She will give them some\add*, and you will put them on your sons and daughters
\add to take with you\add*. In that way you will ◄take away\f + \ft Or: confiscate \f*► the wealth of the Egyptian people.”
