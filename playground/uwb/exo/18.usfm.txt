\c 18  
\s Moses' father-in-law, Jethro, came to visit him 
\p
\v 1 Jethro, who was the priest for the Midian people-group, and who was also Moses'/my father-in-law, heard about all that God
had done for the Israeli people. He heard about how Yahweh had brought them out of Egypt.
\v 2 Moses/I had \add previously\add* sent his/my wife Zipporah \add back
home\add* \add when he/I was returning to Egypt\add*. But now Jethro came to him/me,
\v 3 bringing Zipporah and her two sons. One son was named Gershom,
\add which sounds like the Hebrew word that means 'foreigner'\add*, because he/I had said, “I have been a foreigner living in
another land.” 
\v 4 Her other son was named Eliezer, \add which sounds like the Hebrew words that mean 'God helps
me'\add*, because \add he/I\add* had said “God, whom my father \add worshiped\add*, has helped me and saved
\add me\add* from being killed \f + \fk metonymy \f* by the king \add of Egypt\add*.”
\p
\v 5 While Moses/I was camped \add with the Israeli people\add* in the desert
\add near Sinai\add*, God's sacred/holy mountain, Jethro came to him/me, bringing along Moses'/my wife and
\add two\add* sons. 
\v 6 Jethro had sent a message to Moses/me, “I, your father-in-law, Jethro, am coming to see you, bringing along your wife and
her two sons!” 
\v 7 So Moses/I went out of the campsite to meet his/my father-in-law. He/I bowed before him, and kissed him
\add on the cheek\add*. ◄They both/We► asked each other, “Have you been healthy?” Then they/we went into
\add Moses'/my\add* tent. 
\v 8 Moses/I told Jethro everything that Yahweh had done to the king and all the
\add other\add* people in Egypt for the sake of the Israeli people. He/I also told him about the troubles/problems they/we had
experienced on the way, and how Yahweh had helped them/us. 
\v 9 Jethro rejoiced when he heard all that Yahweh had done for the Israeli people.
\v 10 He said, “Praise Yahweh, who has rescued you from the powerful \f + \fk metonymy \f* Egyptian king and his army!
\v 11 Now I realize that Yahweh is greater than all other gods, because he rescued you from the power \f + \fk metonymy \f* of the proud
Egyptians when \add they\add* were causing you \add to suffer\add*.”
\v 12 Then Jethro brought an animal to sacrifice it by burning it completely on the altar
\add as an offering\add*, and he also offered other sacrifices to God. Aaron and the Israeli elders/leaders went with them/us
to eat a sacred meal with Jethro. 
\s Jethro gave Moses some good advice about appointing judges 
\p
\v 13 The next day, Moses/I sat down at the place where he/I settled disputes among the people. The people were continually
bringing their disputes to Moses/me, from the morning until the evening.
\v 14 When Jethro saw everything that Moses/I was doing for the people, he said, “◄Why are you doing all this for the
people?/You should not be doing all this for the people!► \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* Why are you doing this by yourself, and all the people are
standing around you, from the morning until the evening, \add asking you to make decisions for
them\add* \f + \fk rhetorical question \f*?” 
\v 15 Moses/I replied, “\add I am doing this\add* because the people keep coming to me to find out what God desires.
\v 16 When they have a dispute about something, they come to me, and they ask me to decide which of them is right. I also tell
them all of God's laws and instructions.” 
\v 17 Jethro said to him/me, “What you are doing is not good \add for you or for the
people\add*. 
\v 18 You and these people will ◄wear yourselves out/become exhausted►! This work is too much for you. You are not able to do
it by yourself. 
\v 19 Now listen to some good advice \f + \fk metonymy \f* I will give to you. \add If you do what I
suggest\add*, God will help you. You should continue to speak to God and tell him about the people's disputes.
\v 20 You should \add also\add* teach them what God has commanded and instructed you. You should also explain to them how they
should conduct their lives, and the things that they should do. 
\v 21 In addition, you should choose some \add other men to help
you\add*. Choose men who have reverence for God and who will not accept bribes. Appoint some of them to make decisions
\add for groups of\add* ten people, \add some for groups of\add* fifty
\add people\add*, \add some for groups of\add* a hundred \add people\add*,
\add and some for groups of\add* a thousand \add people\add*. 
\v 22 Allow them to serve permanently to settle disputes for the people. The difficult matters they can bring to you; but the
matters that are not difficult, they can decide themselves. That will make the work easier for you, as they help you do that
work. 
\v 23 If you do that, and \add I think that\add* God is telling you to do it \f + \ft (OR, if God tells you to do it) \f*, you will ◄be able
to endure the stress/not become exhausted►, and all the people will be able to go home peacefully,
\add with their disputes settled quickly”\add*. 
\p
\v 24 Moses/I accepted what his/my father-in-law \add Jethro\add* suggested.
\v 25 Moses/I chose capable men from among the Israeli people. 
\v 26 They were appointed permanently to decide about the people's disputes. They brought the difficult cases to Moses/me, but
they decided the matters that were not difficult by themselves. 
\v 27 Then Moses/I said goodbye to his/my father-in-law, and Jethro returned home.
