\v 1 “\add Tell the people to\add* make the Sacred Tent using ten long strips of fine linen. They must take blue, purple, and
red thread \f + \ft (OR, weave the strips from blue, purple, and red thread), and
\add a skilled craftsman\add* must embroider these strips with \add designs that
represent\add* the winged creatures \add that are above the chest\add*.
\v 2 Each strip is to be ◄fourteen yards/twelve meters► long and two yards/meters wide.
\v 3  \add Tell them to\add* sew five strips together to make one set, and sew the other five strips together to make another
set. 
\v 4 For each set, \add they must\add* make loops of blue \add cloth\add* and fasten them along the outer edge of the strip, at
the end of each set. 
\v 5  \add They must\add* put fifty loops on the edge of the first set, and fifty loops at the edge of the second set.
\v 6  \add Tell them to\add* make fifty gold clasps/fasteners, to fasten both of the sets together. As a result, the inside of
the Sacred Tent will be \add as though it was\add* one piece. 
\p
\v 7 Also, \add tell them to\add* make a cover for the Sacred Tent from eleven pieces of cloth made from goats' hair.
\v 8 Each piece of cloth is to be ◄fifteen yards/thirteen meters► long and two yards/meters wide.
\v 9  \add Tell them to\add* sew five of these pieces of cloth together to make one set, and sew the other six pieces of cloth
together to make another set. \add They\add* must fold the sixth piece
\add of cloth\add* in half to make it double over the front of the Sacred Tent.
\v 10  \add Tell them to\add* make one hundred loops \add of blue
cloth\add*, and to fasten fifty of them to the outer edge of the one set and fasten fifty to the outer edge of the other set.
\v 11  \add Tell them to\add* make fifty bronze clasps/fasteners and put them in the cloth loops to join the two sets together.
As a result, the cover for the Sacred Tent will be \add as though it
was\add* one piece. 
\v 12  \add Let\add* the extra part of the cover, the part that extends beyond
\add the linen cloth\add*, hang over the back of the Sacred Tent.
\v 13 The extra half yard/meter of each cover, the part that extends beyond
\add the linen cloth\add* on each side, must hang over the two sides of the Sacred Tent, to protect the sides.
\v 14  \add Tell them to\add* make two more covers for the Sacred Tent. One is to be made from rams' skins that have been
◄tanned/dyed red►, and the top cover is to be made from goatskin leather.”
\s Instructions for the framework for the Sacred Tent 
\p
\v 15 “\add Tell them to\add* make \add forty-eight\add* frames from acacia wood, frames that will be set up
\add to hang the Sacred Tent covers from them\add*. 
\v 16 Each frame is to be ◄five yards/four meters► long and ◄27 in./66 cm.► wide.
\v 17  \add They\add* must make two projections at the bottom of each frame. These will be to fasten the frames to the bases
underneath them. They must make these projections at the bottom of each frame.
\v 18 Make twenty frames for the south side of the Sacred Tent. 
\v 19  \add Tell them to\add* make forty silver bases to go underneath them. Two bases will go under each frame. The
projections \add at the bottom\add* of each frame are \add to be
made\add* to fit into the bases. 
\v 20  \add Similarly\add*, \add tell them to\add* make twenty frames for the north side of the Sacred Tent.
\v 21  \add They\add* must make forty silver bases for them also, with two bases to be put under each frame.
\v 22 For the rear of the Sacred Tent, on the west side, \add tell them
to\add* make six frames. 
\v 23 Also, \add tell them to\add* make two extra frames, one for each corner of the rear of the Sacred Tent,
\add to provide extra support\add*. 
\v 24 The two corner frames must be separated at the bottom but joined at the top (OR, joined at both the bottom and the top) \f*.
At the top of each of the two corner frames there must be a gold ring for holding the crossbar.
\v 25 In that way, \add for the rear of the Sacred Tent\add* there will be eight frames, and there will be sixteen bases, two
under each frame. 
\p
\v 26  \add Tell them to\add* make fifteen crossbars from acacia wood.
\v 27 Five of them will be for the frames on the north side of the Sacred Tent, five will be for the south side, and five for
the frames at the rear of the Sacred Tent, the west side. 
\v 28 Tell them to fasten the crossbars on the north, south, and west sides of the Sacred Tent to the middle of the frames. The
two long ones must extend from one end of the Sacred Tent to the other, and the crossbar on the west side must extend from one
side of the Sacred Tent to the other. 
\v 29  \add Tell them to\add* cover the frames with gold, and make gold rings to fasten the crossbars to the frames. The
crossbars must \add also\add* be covered with gold. 
\v 30 Erect the Sacred Tent in the way that I have shown you \add here\add* on
\add this\add* mountain.”

\v 34 On top of the chest in the Very Holy Place \add they\add* must put the lid which will be the place where I will

\v 35  \add In the room that is\add* outside of the Very Holy Place,
