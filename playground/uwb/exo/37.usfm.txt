\v 24 He used 75 pounds\f + \ft Or: 35 kg. \f* of pure gold to make the lampstand and all the things that were used to take care of it.
\s Bezalel made the altar for burning incense 
\p
\v 25 Bezalel made the altar \add for burning\add* incense from acacia wood. It was square, 18 in.\f + \ft Or: 45 cm. \f* on each side. It
