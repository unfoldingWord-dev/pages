\v 30 Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* said to the Israeli people, “Listen carefully. Yahweh has chosen Bezalel, the son of Uri and grandson of Hur,
from the tribe of Judah. 
\v 31 Yahweh has enabled his Spirit to completely control Bezalel and has given him ability and enabled him to know how to do
very skilled work. 
\v 32 He can engrave skillful designs in gold, silver, and bronze.
\v 33 He can cut jewels\f + \ft Or: valuable stones \f* and enclose them \add in tiny gold
frames\add*. He can carve things from wood and do other skilled work.
\v 34 Yahweh has also given to him and to Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, from the tribe of Dan the ability to teach their
skills to others. 
\v 35 He has given to them the ability to do all kinds of work that is done by craftsmen—those who create artistic things,
those who make fine white linen, those who embroider designs using blue, purple, or red yarn\f + \ft Or: thread \f*, and those who make other
cloth. They are able to do many \f + \ft hyperbole \f* kinds of skillful work.
