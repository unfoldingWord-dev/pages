\c 7  
\s Yahweh instructed Moses and Aaron 
\p
\v 1 Then Yahweh said to Moses/me, “Listen \add carefully\add*. I will cause the king
\add to consider that\add* you are like a god, and that Aaron is like a prophet.
\v 2 You must tell everything I command you \add to your older\add* brother Aaron, and he will tell that to the king. He must
tell the king to let the Israeli people leave his land. 
\v 3 But I will make the king stubborn [IDI]. As a result, even though I perform many kinds of ◄miracles/terrifying things►
\f + \fr doublet \f* \add here\add* in Egypt, 
\v 4 the king will not pay any attention to what you say. Then I will punish \f + \fr metonymy \f* the people of Egypt \f + \fr metonymy \f* very severely
\f + \fr metonymy \f*, and I will lead/bring the tribes of the Israeli people out of Egypt.
\v 5 Then, when I show my great power \f + \fr metonymy \f* to the Egyptian people and bring the Israeli people out from among them, they will
know that I am Yahweh, \add the all-powerful God\add*.” 
\p
\v 6 Aaron and Moses/I did what Yahweh told them/us to do. They \add went and spoke to the
king\add*. 
\v 7 At that time, Moses/I was 80 years old, and Aaron was 83 years old.
\s Aaron made his stick become a snake, but that did not influence the king
\p
\v 8 Yahweh said to Moses/me, 
\v 9 “If the king says to you, ‘Prove \add that God sent\add* you by performing a miracle,’ then say to Aaron, ‘Throw your
stick down in front of the king, in order that it may become a snake.’ ”
\v 10 So Aaron and Moses/I went to the king and did what Yahweh had commanded
\add them/us to do\add*. Aaron threw his stick down in front of the king and his officials, and it became a snake.
\v 11 Then the king summoned his sorcerers and men who performed magic. They did the same thing, using their magic.
\v 12 They all threw down their sticks, and they became snakes. But Aaron's stick,
\add which had become a snake\add*, swallowed up all their sticks!
\v 13 But the king continued to be stubborn [IDI], just as Yahweh had predicted, and he would not pay attention to
\add what Aaron and Moses/I said\add*. 
\s Moses and Aaron caused the Nile River to become red 
\p
\v 14 Then Yahweh said to Moses/me, “The king is very stubborn [IDI]. He refuses to allow
\add my\add* people to go. 
\v 15 So \add tomorrow\add* morning, go to him as he is going down to the
\add Nile\add* River \add to bathe\add*. Wait for him at the riverbank.
\add When he comes out of the water, show\add* him the stick, the one which became a snake.
\v 16 Say to him, ‘Yahweh God, the one \add we\add* Hebrews \add worship\add*, sent me to you to tell you to let my people go,
in order that they may worship him in the desert. \add We told you
that\add*, but you have not paid any attention to it. 
\v 17  \add So now\add* Yahweh says this: “This is the way you will know that I am Yahweh,
\add the all-powerful God\add*. Watch this: I am going to strike the water that is in the Nile
\add River\add* with the stick that is in my hand. \add When I do
that\add*, the water will become blood (OR, \add red like\add* blood \f + \fr metonymy \f*).
\v 18 Then the fish in the Nile \add River\add* will die, and the
\add water in\add* the river will stink, and the Egyptians will not be able to drink water from the Nile River.” ’ ”
\p
\v 19 Yahweh said to Moses/me, “\add When you are talking to the
king\add*, say to Aaron, ‘Hold your stick out \add as though you were holding
it\add* over the water in Egypt—over the rivers, the canals, the ponds, and over the pools of water, in order that
\add all of it\add* may become blood (OR, \add red like\add* blood).’ When Aaron does that, there will be blood throughout
Egypt, even in wooden jars and in stone jars.” 
\p
\v 20 So Aaron and Moses/I did what Yahweh commanded. As the king and his officials were watching, Aaron lifted up his stick
and then struck the water in the Nile \add River\add* with it. And all the water in the river turned ◄to blood/red like blood►.
\v 21 Then all the fish died. And the water stank, with the result that the Egyptians could not drink water from the river.
Everywhere in Egypt \add the water\add* became \add red like\add* blood.
\v 22 But the men who performed magic did the same thing using their magic. So the king remained stubborn [IDI], and he would
not pay attention to what Aaron and Moses/I said, just as Yahweh had predicted.
\v 23 The king turned and went back to his palace, and he did not think anymore about it [IDI].
\v 24 The Egyptians \f + \fr hyperbole \f* dug \add into the ground\add* near the Nile
\add River\add* to get water to drink, because they could not drink the water from the river.
\s Moses and Aaron caused frogs to appear everywhere 
\p
\v 25 ◄One week/Seven days► passed after Yahweh turned the water in the Nile
\add River into blood\add*.
