\c 34  
\s Yahweh gave Moses another copy of his commandments 
\p
\v 1 Yahweh said to Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f*, "Cut two slabs of stone that will be like the first slabs, the ones that you broke. Then I will
engrave on them the words that were on the first slabs. 
\v 2 Get ready tomorrow morning, and come up to the top of Sinai Mountain again to talk with me there.
\v 3 Do not allow anyone to come up with you. I do not want anyone
\add else\add* to be anywhere on the mountain. Do not allow any sheep or cattle to graze at the base of\f + \ft Or: near \f* the mountain."
\v 4 So Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* cut two slabs of stone that were like the first ones. He\f + \ft Or: I \f* arose early the next morning. He\f + \ft Or: I \f* took the slabs
and carried them in his\f + \ft Or: my \f* hands up to the top of Sinai Mountain, as Yahweh had commanded.
\v 5 Then Yahweh descended in the \add tall\add* cloud and stood with Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f* there. He proclaimed that it was he, Yahweh,
\add who was going to speak to Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f*\add*. 
\v 6 Then Yahweh passed in front of him\f + \ft Or: me \f* and proclaimed, "I am Yahweh God. I always act mercifully and kindly
\add toward people\add*. I do not get angry quickly. I \add truly\add* love
\add people\add* and I do what I promise to do for them, without changing.
\v 7 I love people for thousands of generations. I forgive people for all kinds of sins \f + \ft triple \f*. But I will certainly punish
\f + \ft litotes \f* those who are guilty. I will punish not only them, but I will punish their descendants, down to the third and fourth
generation\f + \ft Or: their children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren \f*."
\p
\v 8 Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* quickly prostrated himself\f + \ft Or: myself \f* on the ground and worshiped
\add Yahweh\add*. 
\v 9 He\f + \ft Or: I \f* said, "Yahweh, if you are now pleased with me, I ask that you go with us. These people are very stubborn [IDI], but
forgive us for all our sins \f + \ft doublet \f*, and accept us to be people who belong to you
\add forever\add*." 
\p
\v 10 Yahweh replied, "Note this: I am going to make a solemn agreement
\add with the Israeli people\add*. As they are watching, I will perform great miracles. They will be miracles that no one has
ever done on the earth in any nation. All the people who are near you will see the great things that I, Yahweh, will do. I will
do awesome things for you \add all\add*. 
\v 11-12  \add Each Israeli\add* person must obey what I am commanding you this day. Do not forget that
\add if you do that\add*, I will expel the Amor, Canaan, Heth, Periz, Hiv, and Jebus people-groups
\add from the land\add*. But be careful that you do not make any
\add peace\add* agreements with any of the people who live in the land into which you are going, because if you
\add do that\add*, \add you will begin to do the evil things that they
do\add*. It will be \add like\add* falling into a trap. 
\v 13 You must tear down their altars, destroy their sacred pillars, and cut down
\add the poles that they use to worship their female goddess\add* Asherah.
\v 14 You must worship only me, \add and\add* not worship any other god, because I, Yahweh, am jealous.
\v 15 Do not make peace agreements with \add any group\add* that lives in that land. When they worship their gods and offer
sacrifices to their gods, and they invite you to join them, do not join them. If
\add you join them\add*, you will eat the food that they sacrifice to their gods, and
\add you will not be faithful to me. You will be like people who\add* commit adultery,
\add who are not being faithful to their spouses\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. 
\v 16 If you take some of their women to be wives for your sons, and these women worship their own gods, they will persuade
your sons also to worship their gods. 
\p
\v 17 Do not pour melted metal into molds to make statues for you to worship.
\p
\v 18  \add Each year\add*, during the month \add of\f + \ft Or: named \f*\add* Abib, celebrate the festival of eating bread made without
yeast. \add During that festival\add*, you must not eat bread made with yeast for seven days, as I commanded you, because it
was in that month that you left Egypt. 
\p
\v 19 Your firstborn sons and the firstborn \add male\add* animals of your cattle and sheep
\add and goats\add* belong to me. 
\v 20 The firstborn of your \add male\add* donkeys \add also belong to
me\add*. But you may buy them back by \add offering to me\add* lambs
\add in their place\add*. If you do not do that, you must \add kill these animals
by\add* breaking their necks. You must also buy back your firstborn sons. You must bring an offering to me \f + \ft litotes \f* each time you
come to \add worship\add* me. 
\p
\v 21  \add Each week\add* you may work for six days, but on the seventh day you must rest.
\add Even\add* during the times when you plow \add the ground\add* and harvest
\add your crops\add*, you must rest \add on the seventh day\add*.
\p
\v 22  \add Each year\add* celebrate the harvest festival, when you begin to harvest the first crop of wheat, and also
celebrate the shelters festival, when you finish harvesting \add the grain and
fruit\add*. 
\p
\v 23 Three times each year all the men must come to worship me, Yahweh, the God of the Israeli people.
\v 24 I will expel the people-groups that live in the land \add where you will
be\add*, and I will cause your territory to become very large. As a result, no group will try to conquer your country when you
come to worship me each year during those three festivals. 
\p
\v 25 When you sacrifice an animal \f + \ft metonymy \f* to me, do not offer with it bread that is made with yeast. And during the Passover
festival, when you sacrifice lambs, do not keep any of the meat until the next morning.
\p
\v 26 I am Yahweh God. You must bring to my Sacred Tent the first part of the grain that you harvest each year. When you kill a
young animal\f + \ft Or: kid \add or lamb or calf \f*\add*, do not \add prepare to eat it
by\add* boiling it in its mother's milk." 
\p
\v 27 Yahweh also said to Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f*, "Write down the words that I have told you. By giving you these commands, I have made a
solemn agreement with you and with the \add other\add* Israeli people."
\p
\v 28 Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* was there \add on the top of the mountain\add* with Yahweh for forty days and nights. During that time he\f + \ft Or: I \f* did
not eat or drink anything \f + \ft synecdoche \f*. He\f + \ft Or: I \f* engraved on the stone slabs the words of the Ten Commandments,
\add which were part of Yahweh's\add* solemn agreement. 
\s Moses' face was shining as he returned to the people 
\p
\v 29 When Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* came back down the mountain, carrying in his\f + \ft Or: my \f* hand the two stone slabs on which were written the Ten
Commandments, his\f + \ft Or: my \f* face was shining because he\f + \ft Or: I \f* had been talking with Yahweh, but he\f + \ft Or: I \f* did not know that his\f + \ft Or: my \f* face was
shining. 
\v 30 When Aaron and the \add other\add* Israeli people saw Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f*, they were amazed\f + \ft Or: surprised \f* that his\f + \ft Or: my \f* face was shining.
So they were afraid to come near him\f + \ft Or: me \f*. 
\v 31 But Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* called to them. Then Aaron and the other Israeli leaders came to him\f + \ft Or: me \f*, and he\f + \ft Or: I \f* talked with them.
\v 32 Afterwards, all the other Israeli people came near, and he\f + \ft Or: I \f* told them all the laws that Yahweh had given to him\f + \ft Or: me \f* on
Sinai Mountain. 
\v 33 When Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* finished talking to the people, he\f + \ft Or: I \f* put a veil over his\f + \ft Or: my \f* face.
\v 34 But whenever Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* entered the Sacred Tent to talk with Yahweh, he\f + \ft Or: I \f* removed the veil. When he\f + \ft Or: I \f* came back out, he\f + \ft Or: I \f*
would always tell to the Israeli people everything that Yahweh had commanded him\f + \ft Or: me \f*
\add to tell them\add*. 
\v 35 The Israeli people would see that Moses'\f + \ft Or: my \f* face was \add still\add* shining. Then he\f + \ft Or: I \f* would put the veil back on his\f + \ft Or: my \f*
face again until the next time that he\f + \ft Or: I \f* went into \add the Sacred
Tent\add* to talk with Yahweh.
