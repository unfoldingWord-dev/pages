\s Moses was born and later adopted by the king's daughter 
\p
\v 1 ◄There was a man who/My father► was descended from \add Jacob's
son\add* Levi. He married a woman who was \add also\add* descended from Levi.
\v 2 She became pregnant and gave birth to ◄a baby boy/me►. When she saw that he/I was a good-looking baby, she hid him/me for
three months, \add because she was not willing to do what the king
commanded\add*. 
\v 3 When she was unable to ◄hide him/me/keep it a secret► any longer, she got a basket made from tall reeds. She covered the
basket with tar ◄\add to make it waterproof/so water could not get
in\add*►. Then she put him/me in the basket and put the basket in
\add the water\add* in the midst of the tall grass at the edge of the Nile
\add River\add*. 
\v 4 His/My older sister was standing not far away, \add watching\add*
\add to see\add* what would happen to him/me. 
\p
\v 5  \add Soon\add* the king's daughter went down to the river to bathe. Her female servants were walking along the riverbank.
She saw the basket amid the tall grass \add in the river\add*. So she sent
\add one of\add* her servants to get it. 
\v 6 When \add the servant brought the basket to her\add*, she opened it, and was surprised to see ◄a baby that was/me►,
crying. She felt sorry for him/me, and said, “This \add must\add* be one of the Hebrews' babies.”
\p
\v 7 Then ◄the baby's/my► \add older\add* sister \add approached\add* the king's daughter and said, “Do you want me to go and
find someone from among the Hebrew women who will \add be able to\add* nurse the baby for you?”
\v 8 The king's daughter said to her, “\add Yes\add*, go \add and find
one\add*.” So the girl went and summoned ◄the baby's/my► mother.
\v 9 The king's daughter said to her, “\add Please\add* take this baby and nurse him for me. I will pay you
\add for doing that\add*.” So ◄the woman/my mother► took him/me and nursed him/me.
\v 10 ◄\add Several years later\add*/when ◄the child/I► grew \add older\add*►, she brought him/me to the king's daughter. She
adopted him/me \add as though I was\add* her own son. She named him/me Moses,
\add which sounds like the Hebrew words 'pull out'\add*, because she said “I pulled him out of the water.”
\s Moses, after murdering an Egyptian, escaped to Midian and later married Zipporah
\p
\v 11 One day, after Moses/I had grown up, he/I went out \add of the palace
area\add* to see his/my people, \add the Hebrews\add*. He/I saw how they were being
\add forced to work\add* very hard. He/I \add also\add* saw an Egyptian
\add man\add* beating one of his/my Hebrew people. 
\v 12 He/I looked around \add to see if anyone was watching\add*. Seeing no one, he/I killed the Egyptian man and buried his
\add body\add* in the sand. 
\p
\v 13 The next day he/I returned \add to the same place\add*. He/I was surprised to see two Hebrew men who were fighting
\add each other\add*. He/I said to the man who started the fight, “Why are you striking your fellow
\add Hebrew\add*?” 
\v 14 The man replied, “◄Who made you our ruler and judge?/No one made you our ruler and judge!► \f + \fk rhetorical question \f*
\add You have no right to interfere with us\add*! Are you going to kill me just like you killed that Egyptian man
\add yesterday\add*?” Then Moses/I was afraid, \add because\add* he/I thought,
“\add Since that man knows what I did\add*, surely \add other people\add* know,
\add too\add*.” 
\p
\v 15  \add And that was correct\add*. The king heard about what he/I had done
\add to that Egyptian. So he ordered his soldiers to\add* execute/kill Moses/me. But he/I fled from the king
\add and left Egypt. He/I traveled east to\add* the Midian \add region\add* and started to live there.
\v 16 The man who was the ◄priest/one who offered the people's gifts to God► for the Midian people,
\add whose name was Jethro\add*, had seven daughters. \add One day\add* as Moses/I sat down beside a well, those girls came
\add to the well\add* and got water, and filled the troughs in order to give water to their father's flock
\add of sheep\add*. 
\v 17 Some ◄shepherds/men who took care of other sheep► came and started to chase away the girls. But Moses/I helped/rescued
the girls, and got water for their sheep. 
\v 18 When the girls returned to their father \add Jethro\add*, \add whose other name
is\add* Reuel, he asked them, “How is it that you were able to \add give water to the sheep
and\add* come home so quickly today?” 
\v 19 They replied, “A man from Egypt kept \f + \fk metonymy \f* other shepherds from sending us away. He also got water for us
\add from the well\add* and gave water to the flock \add of sheep\add*.”
\p
\v 20 He said to his daughters, “Where is he? ◄Why did you leave him
\add out there\add*?/You should not leave him out there!► \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* Invite him
\add in\add*, so he can have something to eat \f + \fk metonymy \f*!” 
\v 21  \add So they did\add*, and Moses/I \add accepted and ate with
them\add*. And Moses/I decided to live there. Later Jethro gave him/me his daughter Zipporah
\add to be his/my wife\add*. 
\v 22 Later she gave birth to a son, and Moses/I named him Gershom,
\add which sounds like the Hebrew words that mean 'foreigner'\add*, because he/I said, “I am living as a foreigner in
\add this\add* land.” 
\p
\v 23 Many years later the king of Egypt died. The Israeli people
\add in Egypt\add* were still groaning because of the \add hard work they had to do
as\add* slaves. They called out for \add someone to\add* help them, and God heard them call out \f + \fk personification \f*.
\v 24 He heard them groaning. And he ◄thought about/did not forget► that he had solemnly promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob
\add to bless their descendants\add*. 
\v 25 God saw how the Israeli people were \add being badly treated\add*, and he was concerned about them.
