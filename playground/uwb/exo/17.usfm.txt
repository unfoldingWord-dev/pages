\s Yahweh provided water gushing from a rock 
\p
\v 1 Obeying what Yahweh commanded, all the Israeli people moved from the Sin desert. They\f + \ft Or: We \f* traveled from one place to
another. They\f + \ft Or: We \f* camped at \add a place named\add* Rephidim, but there was no water there for ◄the people\f + \ft Or: us \f*► to drink.
\v 2 So the people complained to Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f* again, saying, “Give us water to drink!” Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* replied to them, “Why are you
◄criticizing\f + \ft Or: arguing \f* with► me \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f*? And why are you trying to determine whether Yahweh
\add has the power to provide for you\add*?” 
\v 3 But the people were very thirsty, and they continued to complain to Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f*. They were saying things like “Why did you
bring us up out of Egypt?”, and “Did you bring us here to cause us and our children to die ◄from thirst\f + \ft Or: because \f* we had no water
to drink► \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f*?” 
\p
\v 4 So Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* prayed earnestly to Yahweh. He\f + \ft Or: I \f* said, “◄How shall I deal with these people?\f + \ft Or: I \f* do not know how to deal with
these people!► \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* They are almost ready to \add kill me by throwing\add* stones at me!”
\v 5 Yahweh replied to Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f*, “Take some of the elders\f + \ft Or: leaders \f* of the Israeli people with you and
\add tell the rest of\add* the people to follow you \add to\add* Sinai Mountain. Take along the stick with which you struck the
Nile \add River\add*. 
\v 6 Listen carefully: I will stand in front of you on top of a \add large\add* rock at the foot of the mountain. Strike the
rock with your stick. \add When you do that\add*, water for the people to drink will flow out of the rock.”
\add When they\f + \ft Or: we \f* arrived at the mountain\add*, Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* did that while the Israeli elders were watching,
\add and water flowed from the rock\add*. 
\v 7 Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* gave that place two names \add in the Hebrew language:\add* Massah,
\add which means 'testing'\add*, and Meribah, \add which means 'complaining'\add*. He\f + \ft Or: I \f* gave it the name Massah because the
Israeli people were testing Yahweh, saying “Is Yahweh really among us
\add and able to help us\add*, or not?”, and he\f + \ft Or: I \f* gave it the name Meribah because they were
\add continually\add* complaining. 
\s God enabled the Israeli men to defeat the Amalekites 
\p
\v 8 Then the descendants of Amalek people-group came and fought against the Israeli people at Rephidim.
\v 9 Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* said to Joshua, \add who was one of our army\f + \ft Or: Israeli \f*
leaders\add*, “Choose some men to go out and fight against the Amalek people-group tomorrow. I will stand on the top of the
hill, holding the stick that God told me to carry.” 
\v 10 So Joshua did what Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* told him to do. He took some men to fight against the Amalek people-group.
\add While they were fighting\add*, Aaron, Hur, and Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* went up to the top of the hill
\add so that they could see the whole battle area\add*. 
\v 11 Whenever Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* lifted up his\f + \ft Or: my \f* arms, the Israeli men started to win
\add the battle\add*. And whenever he\f + \ft Or: I \f* lowered his\f + \ft Or: my \f* arms, the Amalek people-group started to win.
\v 12 But his\f + \ft Or: my \f* arms became tired. So Aaron and Hur \add rolled\add* a
\add large\add* stone for him\f + \ft Or: me \f* to sit on. \add While he\f + \ft Or: I \f* was sitting on
it\add*, those two held up his\f + \ft Or: my \f* arms. In that way, they kept his\f + \ft Or: my \f* arms lifted up steadily until the sun went down.
\v 13 So Joshua and the men with him completely defeated the Amalek people-group, using their swords
\add to fight against them\add*. 
\v 14 Then Yahweh said to Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f*, “Write an account of this battle, and then read it to Joshua.
\add Also write that\add* \add some day\add* I will completely get rid of the Amalek people-group.”
\v 15 Then Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* built a \add stone\add* altar there and named it 'Yahweh is
\add like\add* my flag.' 
\v 16 He\f + \ft Or: I \f* said, “Hold high Yahweh's flag! Yahweh will continue to fight against the Amalek people-group ◄forever\f + \ft Or: in \f* all future
generations►!”
