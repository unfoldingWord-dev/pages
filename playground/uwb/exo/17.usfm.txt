\c 17  
\s Yahweh provided water gushing from a rock 
\p
\v 1 Obeying what Yahweh commanded, all the Israeli people moved from the Sin desert. They/We traveled from one place to
another. They/We camped at \add a place named\add* Rephidim, but there was no water there for ◄the people/us► to drink.
\v 2 So the people complained to Moses/me again, saying, “Give us water to drink!” Moses/I replied to them, “Why are you
◄criticizing/arguing with► me \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*? And why are you trying to determine whether Yahweh
\add has the power to provide for you\add*?” 
\v 3 But the people were very thirsty, and they continued to complain to Moses/me. They were saying things like “Why did you
bring us up out of Egypt?”, and “Did you bring us here to cause us and our children to die ◄from thirst/because we had no water
to drink► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*?” 
\p
\v 4 So Moses/I prayed earnestly to Yahweh. He/I said, “◄How shall I deal with these people?/I do not know how to deal with
these people!► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* They are almost ready to \add kill me by throwing\add* stones at me!”
\v 5 Yahweh replied to Moses/me, “Take some of the elders/leaders of the Israeli people with you and
\add tell the rest of\add* the people to follow you \add to\add* Sinai Mountain. Take along the stick with which you struck the
Nile \add River\add*. 
\v 6 Listen carefully: I will stand in front of you on top of a \add large\add* rock at the foot of the mountain. Strike the
rock with your stick. \add When you do that\add*, water for the people to drink will flow out of the rock.”
\add When they/we arrived at the mountain\add*, Moses/I did that while the Israeli elders were watching,
\add and water flowed from the rock\add*. 
\v 7 Moses/I gave that place two names \add in the Hebrew language:\add* Massah,
\add which means 'testing'\add*, and Meribah, \add which means 'complaining'\add*. He/I gave it the name Massah because the
Israeli people were testing Yahweh, saying “Is Yahweh really among us
\add and able to help us\add*, or not?”, and he/I gave it the name Meribah because they were
\add continually\add* complaining. 
\s God enabled the Israeli men to defeat the Amalekites 
\p
\v 8 Then the descendants of Amalek people-group came and fought against the Israeli people at Rephidim.
\v 9 Moses/I said to Joshua, \add who was one of our army/Israeli
leaders\add*, “Choose some men to go out and fight against the Amalek people-group tomorrow. I will stand on the top of the
hill, holding the stick that God told me to carry.” 
\v 10 So Joshua did what Moses/I told him to do. He took some men to fight against the Amalek people-group.
\add While they were fighting\add*, Aaron, Hur, and Moses/I went up to the top of the hill
\add so that they could see the whole battle area\add*. 
\v 11 Whenever Moses/I lifted up his/my arms, the Israeli men started to win
\add the battle\add*. And whenever he/I lowered his/my arms, the Amalek people-group started to win.
\v 12 But his/my arms became tired. So Aaron and Hur \add rolled\add* a
\add large\add* stone for him/me to sit on. \add While he/I was sitting on
it\add*, those two held up his/my arms. In that way, they kept his/my arms lifted up steadily until the sun went down.
\v 13 So Joshua and the men with him completely defeated the Amalek people-group, using their swords
\add to fight against them\add*. 
\v 14 Then Yahweh said to Moses/me, “Write an account of this battle, and then read it to Joshua.
\add Also write that\add* \add some day\add* I will completely get rid of the Amalek people-group.”
\v 15 Then Moses/I built a \add stone\add* altar there and named it 'Yahweh is
\add like\add* my flag.' 
\v 16 He/I said, “Hold high Yahweh's flag! Yahweh will continue to fight against the Amalek people-group ◄forever/in all future
generations►!”
