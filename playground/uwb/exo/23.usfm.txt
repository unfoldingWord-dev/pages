\c 23  
\s Treat people and animals fairly 
\p
\v 1 “Do not tell to others false rumors\f + \ft Or: untrue reports \f* about other people. Do not help someone who is guilty by testifying
falsely\f + \ft Or: lying \f* \add about what happened\add*. 
\p
\v 2 Do not join with a group of people who are planning do something evil. Do not testify in the way the
\add crowd wants you to\add*, if that will prevent \add the judge from deciding the
case\add* justly\f + \ft Or: fairly \f*. 
\v 3 When a poor person is on trial, do not \add testify in\add* his favor
\add just\add* because he is poor \add and you feel sorry for him\add*.
\p
\v 4 If you see someone's bull or donkey when it is wandering away
\add loose\add*, take it back to \add its owner, even if the owner\add* is your enemy.
\v 5 If you see someone's donkey that has fallen down \add because of its heavy
load\add*, help the owner to get the donkey up again, \add even if\add* he is someone who hates you. Do not just walk away
\add without helping him\add*. 
\p
\v 6 Decide the cases of poor people who are on trial \add as\add* fairly
\add as you judge the cases of other people\add*. 
\p
\v 7 Do not accuse people falsely. Do not decide that innocent and righteous \f + \ft doublet \f* people should be executed, because I will
punish\f + \ft Or: not forgive \f* people who do such an evil thing. 
\p
\v 8 Do not accept money that is a bribe, because officials who accept bribes are not able to \f + \ft metonymy \f* decide what is right to do,
and they do not allow innocent people to be treated fairly. 
\p
\v 9 Do not mistreat foreigners \add who live among you\add*. You know
\add how people often treat\add* foreigners, because the Egyptians
\add did not treat you well when\add* you were foreigners there.
\p
\v 10 Plant \add seeds\add* in your ground and gather the harvest for six years.
\v 11 But on the seventh year you must not plant anything. \add If things grow without your planting
seeds\add*, allow the poor people \add to harvest and\add* eat the crops. If there are still crops ◄left over\f + \ft Or: that \f* they do not
harvest►, allow the wild animals to eat them. Do the same thing with your grapevines\f + \ft Or: vineyards \f* and your olive trees.
\p
\v 12  \add You may\add* work for six days \add each week\add*, but on the seventh day you must rest
\add and not work\add*. And on the seventh day you must allow your work animals and your slaves and the foreigners
\add who live among you\add* also \add to\add* \add rest and\add* have their strength refreshed.
\p
\v 13 Make certain that you obey everything that I have commanded
\add you to do\add*. Do not pray to \f + \ft metonymy \f* other gods. Do not even mention their names.”
\s Rules about three annual festivals 
\p
\v 14 “Every year you must celebrate three festivals to \add honor\add* me.
\v 15  \add The first one\add* is the festival of bread that has no yeast. Celebrate it in the month
\add that is named\add* Abib. That is the month in which you left Egypt. Celebrate it in the way that I commanded you. Always
bring \f + \ft litotes \f* an offering when you come to worship me. 
\v 16 The second one is the festival of harvesting. During that festival you must offer to me the first parts\f + \ft Or: harvest \f* of your
crops that grow from the seeds that you planted. The third one is the festival of shelters. That will be after you finish
harvesting your grain and grapes and fruit. 
\v 17 Every year, at each of these times, all the men must gather together to worship me, Yahweh God.
\p
\v 18 When you sacrifice an animal \add and offer\add* \add it\add* to me, you must not offer bread that has been baked with
yeast. \add When you\add* offer sacrifices, \add burn\add* the fat
\add from the animals on that same day\add*. Do not allow any fat to remain until the next morning.
\p
\v 19 Each year, when you harvest your crops, bring to the place where you worship me, Yahweh God, the first part of what you
harvest. When you kill a young animal\f + \ft Or: kid \add or lamb or calf \f*\add*, do not
\add prepare to eat it by\add* boiling it in its mother's milk.”
\s Yahweh gave the Israeli people several promises 
\p
\v 20-21 “Note this: I am going to send an angel ahead of you, to guard you as you travel and to bring you safely to the place
that I have prepared \add for you\add*. Pay attention to what he says and obey him. Do not rebel against him, because he will
have my authority \f + \ft metonymy \f* and he will punish\f + \ft Or: not forgive \f* \f + \ft litotes \f* you if you rebel against him.
\v 22 But if you pay attention to what he says and if you do all that I tell you
\add to do\add*, I will fight strongly \f + \ft doublet \f* against all of your enemies.
\v 23 My angel will go ahead of you, and will take you to where the Amor and Heth and Periz and Canaan and Hiv and Jebus
people-groups live, and I will completely get rid of them. 
\v 24 Do not bow down before their gods\f + \ft Or: idols \f* or worship them. And do not do the things
\add that they think that their gods want\add* them to do. Completely destroy their gods\f + \ft Or: idols \f*, and smash to pieces their
sacred stones. 
\p
\v 25 You must worship me, Yahweh God. \add If you do that\add*, I will bless your \f + \ft Or: bless
\add you by giving you\add* \f* food and water, and I will protect you from becoming sick.
\v 26 No women in your land will have miscarriages\f + \ft Or: babies that will die after being born prematurely \f*, and no women will be
unable to become pregnant. I will enable you to live a long time.
\p
\v 27 I will cause the people who oppose you to become very afraid of me. I will cause the people whom you fight against to
become very confused. And then I will cause them to turn around and run away from you.
\v 28 I will cause your enemies to become terrified. And I will expel the Hiv, Canaan, and Heth people-groups from your land.
\v 29 I will not expel \add all of\add* them in less than one year. If I did that, your land would become deserted, and there
would be very many wild animals ◄\add that would attack you\f + \ft Or: you \f* would not be able to
control\add*►. 
\v 30 I will expel those people-groups slowly, a few at a time, until the number of your people increases and you are able to
live everywhere in the land. 
\v 31 I will cause the borders of your land to extend from the Red Sea\f + \ft Or: Gulf of Aqaba \f*
\add in the southeast\add* to the Mediterranean Sea \add in the northwest\add*, and from the
\add Sinai\add* Desert \add in the southwest\add* to the \add Euphrates\add* River
\add in the northeast of the country\add*. I will give you the power \f + \ft metonymy \f* to expel the people who live there, so that you will
expel them as you occupy more of the country. 
\v 32 You must not make any agreement\f + \ft Or: treaty \f* with those people or with their gods.
\v 33 Do not allow \add those people\add* to live in your land, in order that they do not cause you to sin against me. If you
worship their gods, \add you will not be able to escape from worshiping them and sinning against me, just like someone
caught\add* in a trap \add is unable to escape\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*.”
