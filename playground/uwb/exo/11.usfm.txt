\c 11  
\s Yahweh declared that all the oldest sons of the Egyptians would die, and then the king's officials would plead for the
Israeli people to leave Egypt 
\p
\v 1 Then Yahweh said to Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f*, “I will bring one more disaster on the king of Egypt and on all his people \f + \ft metonymy \f*. After
that, he will let you leave. In fact, he will expel you all. 
\v 2 So now speak to all the \add Israeli\add* people. Tell them to ask all their
\add Egyptian\add* neighbors, both men and women, to give them some silver and gold jewelry.”
\v 3 Yahweh made the Egyptians highly respect the Israeli people. In particular, the Egyptian officials and all
\add the rest of\add* the people considered Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f* to be a very great man.
\p
\v 4 Then Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* \add went to the king and\add* said, “This is what Yahweh says: ‘About midnight
\add tonight\add* I will go through Egypt, 
\v 5 and I will cause all the firstborn\f + \ft Or: oldest \f* \add sons\add* to die. That will include your oldest son, the oldest sons of the
slave women who grind grain, \add and the oldest sons of everyone
else\add*. I will also kill the oldest males of the Egyptians' livestock.
\v 6 When that happens, people all over Egypt will wail loudly. They have never wailed like that before, and they will never
wail like that again. 
\v 7 But among the Israeli people \add it will be so quiet that\add* not even a dog will bark! Then you will know for sure that
I, Yahweh, distinguish \add how I act toward\add* the Egyptians and
\add how I act toward\add* the Israeli people. 
\v 8 Then all these officials of yours will come and bow down before me and will say, “Please get out
\add of Egypt\add*, you and all the Israeli people!” ’ After that, I will leave Egypt!”
\add After Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* said that\add*, he\f + \ft Or: I \f* very angrily left the king.
\p
\v 9 Then Yahweh said to Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f*, “The king will not pay any attention to what you say. The result will be that I will perform
more miracles in the land of Egypt.” 
\p
\v 10 Aaron and Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* performed all these miracles in front of the king, but Yahweh made the king stubborn, and he did not
let the Israeli people leave his land.
