\c 33  
\s Yahweh further rebuked and warned the Israeli people 
\p
\v 1 Yahweh said to Moses/me, “Leave this place and go with the people whom you led out of Egypt. Go to the land that I
promised Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob that I would give to their descendants.
\v 2 I will send my angel ahead of you, and I will expel \add from that
land\add* the Canaan, Amor, Heth, Periz, Hiv, and Jebus people-groups.
\v 3 You will go to a land that will be very good for raising livestock and growing crops [IDI]. But I will not go with you
myself, because \add if I did that\add*, I might get rid of you while you are traveling, because you are very stubborn [IDI]
people.” 
\p
\v 4-5 Yahweh said to Moses/me, “Tell the Israeli people, ‘You are very stubborn [IDI]. If I would go with you for even a
moment, I would completely ◄get rid of you/wipe you out►. Now take off your jewelry
\add to show that you are sorry for having sinned\add*. Then I will decide how I will punish you (OR, if I should punish
you).’ ” So when Moses/I told to the people what God said, they started to mourn, and they all took off their jewelry.
\v 6 After the Israeli people left Sinai Mountain, they did not wear jewelry anymore.
\p
\v 7  \add When the Israeli people\add* \add traveled\add*, whenever they stopped and set up their tents, Moses/I set up the
Sacred Tent outside the camp, far from the camp. He called it 'the Sacred Tent where God and I talk together.' Everyone who
wanted Yahweh to decide something for them would go out of the camp to the Sacred Tent.
\v 8 Whenever Moses/I went out to the Sacred Tent, all the people would stand at the entrances of their tents and watch him/me
until he/I had entered the Sacred Tent. 
\v 9 When Moses/I entered the Sacred Tent, the tall cloud that looked like a fire would come down and stay at the entrance of
the Sacred Tent, and then Yahweh would talk with Moses/me. 
\v 10 When the people saw the tall cloud at the entrance of the Sacred Tent, they would all prostrate themselves on the ground
and worship Yahweh. 
\v 11 Yahweh would speak to Moses/me directly, like someone speaks to his friend. Then Moses/I would return to the camp. But
his/my young helper, Joshua, the son of Nun, stayed in the Sacred Tent.
\s Yahweh promised to be with his people and to let Moses see his glory
\p
\v 12 Moses/I said to Yahweh, “It is true that you have told me, ‘Lead the people to the land
\add that I will show you\add*,’ and you have said that you know me well and that you are pleased with me, but you have not
told me whom you will send with me! 
\v 13 So now, if you are truly pleased with me, I ask you, tell me the things that you intend/plan to do, in order that I will
know you \add better\add* and continue to please you. Also, do not forget that the
\add Israeli\add* people are the people whom you chose to belong to you.”
\v 14 Yahweh replied, “I will go with you, and I will give you inner peace.”
\v 15 Moses/I replied, “If you do not go with me, do not force us to leave this place.
\v 16 The only way that \add other\add* people will know that you are pleased with me and with your people is if you go with us
[RHQ]! ◄If you go with us, \add that will show that\add* we are different from all the other people on the earth./If you do not
go with us, what will show that we are different from all the other people on the earth?►” [RHQ]
\v 17 Yahweh replied to Moses/me, “What you have asked is exactly what I will do, because I know you well and I am pleased with
you.” 
\p
\v 18 Then Moses/I said, “Please let me see your glorious presence!”
\v 19 Yahweh replied, “I will let you see how great and glorious I am, and I will tell you clearly that my name is Yahweh. I
will act very kindly and be merciful to all those whom I choose.
\v 20 But you cannot see my face, because anyone who sees my face will ◄die/not continue to stay alive►.
\v 21 But look! Here is a place close to me where you can stand on a
\add large\add* rock. 
\v 22 When my glorious presence comes past you, I will put you in a large crevice/opening in the rock, and I will cover your
face with my hand until I have passed by. 
\v 23 Then I will take my hand away, and you will see my back, but you will not see my face.”
