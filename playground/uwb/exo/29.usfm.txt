\s Instructions for dedicating the priests 
\p
\v 1 “This is what you must do to dedicate Aaron and his sons to serve me
\add by being\add* priests: select one young bull and two rams that do not have any defects.
\v 2 Bake three \add kinds of bread\add* using finely-ground wheat flour, but without yeast: bake some buns\f + \ft Or: small loaves \f* that
do not have any olive oil in them, bake some buns that have olive oil in the dough, and bake some thin wafers that will be
smeared with olive oil \add after they are baked\add*. 
\v 3 Put them in a basket and offer them \add to me\add* when you sacrifice the young bull and the two rams.
\v 4 Take Aaron and his sons to the entrance of the Sacred Tent, and wash them
\add ritually\add*. 
\v 5 Then put the special clothes on Aaron—the long-sleeved tunic\f + \ft Or: gown \f*, the robe that will be worn underneath the sacred apron,
the sacred apron, the sacred pouch, and the sash\f + \ft Or: waistband \f*. 
\v 6 Put the turban on his head, and fasten to the turban the ornament that has the words 'Dedicated to Yahweh' engraved on it.
\v 7 Then take the oil and pour some on his head to dedicate him\f + \ft Or: set him apart \f*.
\v 8 Then bring his sons and put the long-sleeved tunics\f + \ft Or: gowns \f* on them.
\v 9 Put the sashes\f + \ft Or: waistbands \f* around their waists and the caps on their heads. That is the ritual by which you are to
dedicate them\f + \ft Or: set them apart \f* to be priests. Aaron and his male descendants must serve me
\add by being\add* priests forever. 
\p
\v 10 Then bring the young bull to the entrance of the Sacred Tent. Tell Aaron and his sons to put their hands on the head of
the young bull. 
\v 11 Then, while they do that, kill the young bull \add by slitting its throat, and catch\f + \ft Or: drain \f* the blood in a
bowl\add*. 
\v 12 Take some of that blood with your finger and smear it on the projections of the altar. Throw\f + \ft Or: Splash \f* the rest of the blood
against the base of the altar. 
\v 13 Take all the fat that covers the inner organs of the young bull, the best part of the liver, and the two kidneys with the
fat on them, and burn all these on the altar \add as an offering to
me\add*. 
\v 14 But the meat of the young bull and its hide and intestines must be burned outside the camp. That will be an offering to
cover\f + \ft Or: forgive the guilt of \f* your sins. 
\p
\v 15 Then select one of the rams, and tell Aaron and his sons to put their hands on the head of the ram.
\v 16 Then kill the ram \add by slitting its throat. Catch\f + \ft Or: Drain \f* some of the blood
and\add* splash it against all four sides of the altar. 
\v 17 Then cut the ram into pieces. Wash its inner organs and its rear legs and put those with the head
\v 18 and burn them \add completely\add* on the altar with the rest of the ram. That will be an offering to me, Yahweh, and the
smell will please me. 
\p
\v 19 Take the other ram \add that was selected for these rituals\add*, and tell Aaron and his sons to put their hands on the
ram's head. 
\v 20 Then kill the ram by slitting its throat, and catch\f + \ft Or: drain \f* some of the blood
\add in a bowl\add*. Smear some of the blood on the lobe of the right ears of Aaron and his sons, and on the thumbs of their
right hands, and on the big toes of their right feet. Throw\f + \ft Or: Splash \f* the rest of the blood against the four sides of the altar.
\v 21 Wipe up some of the blood that is on the altar, mix it with some of the oil for anointing, and sprinkle it on Aaron and
his clothes, and on his sons and their clothes. By doing that, you will dedicate them and their clothes
\add to me\add*. 
\p
\v 22 Also, cut off the ram's fat and its fat tail and the fat that covers the inner organs, the best part of the liver, the
two kidneys with the fat on them, and the right thigh. 
\v 23 Take also one of each of the kinds of bread \add that was baked\add*—one made with no oil, one with oil, and one thin
wafer. 
\v 24 Put all these things in the hands of Aaron and his sons. \add Then tell them
to\add* lift them up \add high\add* to dedicate them to me. 
\v 25 Then take them from their hands and burn them on the altar, on top of the other things
\add that were placed there\add*. That \add also\add* will be an offering to me, and its smell will please me.
\v 26 Then take the breast of the second ram that was killed, and lift it up
\add high\add* for an offering to me. But then this part of the animal will be for you
\add to eat\add*. 
\v 27 Then take the breast, the other thigh of the first ram that was sacrificed to dedicate\f + \ft Or: set apart \f* the priests, and the
ram whose other parts were lifted high to show that they were an offering to me; and set the breast and thigh apart for Aaron
and his sons, for them to eat. 
\v 28 In the future, whenever the Israeli people present to me, Yahweh, offerings to restore fellowship with other people, the
breast and the thigh \add of animals that they sacrifice\add* are for Aaron and his male descendants
\add to eat\add*. 
\p
\v 29 After Aaron \add dies\add*, the special clothes that he wore will belong to his sons. They are to wear those clothes when
they are set apart\f + \ft Or: dedicated \f* \add to become priests\add*. 
\v 30 Aaron's son who becomes priest and enters the Sacred Tent and performs rituals in the Holy Place must
\add stay in the Sacred Tent\add*, wearing these special clothes, for seven days.
\p
\v 31 Take the meat of the other ram that was sacrificed to set apart\f + \ft Or: dedicate \f* Aaron and his sons, and boil it in the
courtyard. 
\v 32 After it is cooked, Aaron and his sons must eat it, along with the bread that is left in the basket, at the entrance of
the Sacred Tent. 
\v 33 They must eat the meat of the ram that was sacrificed to cover\f + \ft Or: forgive the guilt of \f*
\add your sins\add* when they were dedicated to do this work. They are the only ones who are permitted to eat this meat.
\add Those who are not priests are not allowed to eat it\add*, because it is dedicated to me.
\v 34 If any of this meat or some of the bread is not eaten that night, no one is permitted to eat any of it the next day. It
must be completely burned, because it is sacred\f + \ft Or: dedicated \f* to me.
\p
\v 35 Those are the rituals that you(sg) must obey during those seven days when you dedicate Aaron and his sons for this work.
You must do all that I have commanded you. 
\v 36 Each of those seven days you must also sacrifice a young bull for an offering to me, in order that I may forgive sins.
Also, you must make another offering to make the altar pure in my sight\f + \ft Or: in order that I will consider the altar to be pure \f*.
You must also anoint the altar with olive oil, to set it apart\f + \ft Or: dedicate it \f*.
\v 37 Perform these rituals every day for seven days, to set apart\f + \ft Or: dedicate \f* the altar and make it pure. If you do not do
that, anyone or anything that touches the altar will become taboo.
\p
\v 38 You must also sacrifice lambs and burn them on the altar. Each of those
\add seven\add* days you must sacrifice two lambs. 
\v 39 One lamb must be sacrificed in the morning, and one must be sacrificed in the evening.
\v 40 With the first lamb, also offer 2 pounds\f + \ft Or: 1 kilogram \f* of finely-ground wheat flour mixed with a quart, Or: liter of the best
kind of olive oil, and a quart\f + \ft Or: liter \f* of wine as an offering. 
\v 41 In the evening, when you sacrifice the other lamb, offer the same amounts of flour, olive oil, and wine as you did in the
morning. This will be an offering to me, Yahweh, that will be burned, and its smell will please me.
\v 42 You \add and your descendants\add* must continue making these offerings to me, Yahweh, throughout all future generations.
You must offer them at the entrance of the Sacred Tent. That is where I will meet with you and speak to you.
\v 43 That is where I will meet with the Israeli people, and the brilliant light of my presence will cause that place to be
holy\f + \ft Or: sacred \f*. 
\v 44 I will dedicate the Sacred Tent and the altar. I will also dedicate Aaron and his sons to serve me
\add by being\add* priests. 
\v 45 I will live among the Israeli people, and I will be their God.
\v 46 They will know that I am Yahweh God, the one who brought them out of Egypt in order that I might live among them. I am
Yahweh, their \add almighty\add* God.”
