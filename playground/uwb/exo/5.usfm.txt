\c 5  
\s The king refused to let the Israeli people go after Moses and Aaron talked to him
\p
\v 1 Then Aaron and Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* went to the king and \add one of them\f + \ft Or: us \f*\add* said, “Yahweh God, whom
\add we\add* Israeli people \add worship\add*, says this \add to
you\add*: ‘Let my people go \add to the desert\add*, in order that they may have a feast to
\add honor\add* me!’ ” 
\v 2 But the king said, “Who is Yahweh? Why should I pay attention to what he says and let the Israeli
\add people\add* \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* go? I do not know Yahweh! And furthermore, I will not let the Israeli
\add people\add* go!” 
\v 3 They\f + \ft Or: we \f* replied, “Yahweh God, the one we Hebrews \add worship\add*, has ◄revealed himself\f + \ft Or: appeared \f*► to us
\add and told us what to tell you\add*. So we ask you to \add please\add* let us go on a three day journey into the desert. We
must offer sacrifices to Yahweh God \add there\add*. \add If we do\add* not do that, he will cause us to die [IDI] from
diseases or from attacks \add by our enemies\add* \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f*.” 
\v 4 But the king of Egypt said to them\f + \ft Or: us \f*, “Moses and Aaron, ◄why are you preventing the Israeli people from working?\f + \ft Or: stop \f*
trying to keep the Israeli people from working!► \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* \add Tell those
slaves\add* to return to work!” 
\v 5 The king also said, “Listen \add to me\add*! \add You\add* people
\add who now live\add* in this land are now \add more\add* numerous
\add than we Egyptians\add* \f + \ft (OR, \add the ordinary people in this land are very
numerous\add*) \f*. So now do you want them \add to stop working and\add* rest \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f*?”
\s The king increased the amount of work the Israelis were forced to do
\p
\v 6 That same day the king commanded the Egyptian slave bosses and the
\add Israeli\add* men supervising the slaves, 
\v 7 “Do not continue to give the \add Israeli\add* people straw for making bricks, as you have done previously. Make them go
\add into the fields\add* and gather straw for themselves. 
\v 8 But require them to make the same number of bricks that they did before. Do not decrease the number at all. They ◄are
lazy\f + \ft Or: do \f* not have enough work to do►. That is the reason they are asking me to let them go
\add into the desert\add* to offer sacrifices to their god. 
\v 9 Force the men to work harder, so that they will not \add have
time\add* to listen to lies \add from their leaders\add*!” 
\p
\v 10 So the slave bosses and supervisors of the slaves went to where the
\add Israeli\add* people were and said to them, “The king has said that he will no longer give you any straw.
\v 11  \add So\add* you yourselves must go and get straw wherever you can find it. But you must still keep working to make the
same number of bricks as before.” \\f + \\ft litotes \\f* 
\v 12 So the Israeli people went all over Egypt to find straw. 
\v 13 The slave bosses kept telling them insistently, “Finish the work you are required to do each day,
\add making the same amount of bricks\add* as you did \add before when we gave
you\add* straw!” 
\v 14  \add When they were not able to do that\add*, the slave bosses had the
\add Israeli supervisors\add* beaten \add with sticks\add*, and they asked them, “Why have
\add all the men you are supervising\add* not been able to make \add the same
number\add* of bricks today\f + \ft Or: now \f* as \add they did\add* before \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f*?”
\s The king refused to pay attention to the complaints of the Israelis
\p
\v 15 Then the Israeli supervisors went to the king and complained, saying
“\add Your Majesty\add*, why are you treating us this way? 
\v 16  \add Now\add* they are not giving us any straw \add for making
bricks\add*, but they keep commanding us to make bricks. And now sometimes they beat us. But it is the fault of your own slave
bosses \add that we cannot make as many bricks as before\add*!” 
\v 17 But the king said, “You are lazy and do not \add want to\add* work! That is why you keep saying, ‘Allow us to go
\add to the desert\add* and offer sacrifices to Yahweh.’ 
\v 18 So go and get back to work! \add We\add* are not going to give you any straw, but you must keep making the same number of
bricks!” 
\p
\v 19 The Israeli supervisors realized that they were in a difficult situation, because they had been told, “We are not going
to decrease the number of bricks \add you must make\add* each day.”
\v 20 As they left the king's \add palace\add*, they met Aaron and Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f*, who were waiting for them
\add there\add*. 
\v 21 They said to Aaron and Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f*, “Yahweh has seen \add what\add* you two
\add have done\add*! He will punish you \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f*, because you have caused the king and his officials to despise us! You have given
them an excuse \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* to kill us!” 
\p
\v 22 Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* left them and prayed to Yahweh again, saying, “O Yahweh, why have you caused all these evil things to happen to
your people \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f*? And why did you send me \add here\add* \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f*?
\v 23 Ever since I went to the king and told him what you told me to say \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f*, he has treated your people very cruelly, and
you have not done anything to help\f + \ft Or: rescue \f* them!”
