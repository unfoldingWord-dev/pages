\c 10  
\s Yahweh sent locusts to destroy the rest of the Egyptians' crops
\p
\v 1 Then Yahweh said to Moses/me, “Go to the king \add again\add*. I have made him and his officials stubborn [IDI]. I have
done that in order that I would \add have a good reason to\add* perform all these miracles among them,
\v 2 and also in order that you would \add be able to\add* tell your children and your grandchildren how I caused the Egyptians
to act very foolishly \add when\add* I performed all these miracles. Then all of you will know that I am Yahweh,
\add the all-powerful God\add*.” 
\p
\v 3 So Aaron and Moses/I went into the king's \add palace\add* and said to him, “Yahweh God, the one we Hebrews
\add worship\add*, says this: ‘How long will you stubbornly refuse to do what I tell you \f + \fr metonymy \f*? Let my people go, in order that
they may worship me \add in the desert\add*! 
\v 4 If you \add keep\add* refusing to let them go, I warn you that tomorrow I will bring
◄locusts/\add large flying insects called\add* locusts► into your country.
\v 5  \add They will completely cover the ground so that\add* you will not even be able to see the ground. They will eat
everything that the hail did not \add destroy\add*. They will eat
\add everything that is left on\add* the trees that are still growing.
\v 6 They will fill your houses, and the houses of all your officials, and the houses of all
\add the rest of\add* the Egyptians. \add There will be more locusts\add* than you or your parents or your grandparents have
ever seen, from the time your ancestors first came to \add this\add* land until the present time!’ ” Then he/I turned and left
the king, \add along with Aaron\add*. 
\p
\v 7 The king's officials said to him, “◄How long is this man going to continue to bring disasters on us?/We must not let this
man continue to cause trouble for us!► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* Let the \add Israeli\add* men leave, in order that they may worship Yahweh, their
god. ◄Do you not yet understand that \add this man\add* has ruined Egypt?/You ought to realize by now that
\add this man\add* has ruined Egypt!►” \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* 
\v 8 So they brought Aaron and Moses/me back to the king. He said to them/us,
“\add All right\add*, you can go and worship Yahweh your god. But who are the ones who will go?”
\v 9 Moses/I replied, “We \add all\add* need to go, everyone, including those who are young and those who are old. We need to
take our sons and our daughters and our flocks \add of sheep and
goats\add* and herds \add of livestock\add*, because we must have a festival to
\add honor\add* Yahweh.” 
\p
\v 10  \add Moses/I really did not intend that the Israelis would ever return to Egypt, and the king knew that also.
So\add* the king replied, “\add If you all leave\add*, \add it will be clear
that\add* Yahweh has helped you, but I myself will never let you
\add take\add* your children \add and your wives\add* when you go! It is clear that you are wickedly planning
\add not to return\add*. 
\v 11 So no, \add I will not let you all go\add*. \add The Israeli\add* men may go
\add and worship Yahweh\add*, if that is what you want.” Then the king expelled them/us from
\add his palace\add*. 
\p
\v 12 Then Yahweh said to Moses/me, “Reach out your hand as \add though you were stretching
it\add* over the land to welcome the locusts. They will come to the country of Egypt and eat every plant that is
\add left\add* in the land, every plant that the hail has not destroyed.”
\p
\v 13 So Moses/I held out his/my stick \add as though he/I was stretching
it\add* over the whole land of Egypt. Then Yahweh caused a \add strong\add* wind to blow from the east, and it blew over the
land all that day and all that night. By the \add next\add* morning, it had brought the locusts.
\v 14 The locusts swarmed all over Egypt. It was larger than any swarm of locusts that had ever
\add been seen\add*, and there will never be \add a swarm of locusts like
that\add* again. 
\v 15 They covered the surface of the ground and made it \add appear\add* black. They ate all the plants in the land and
everything on the trees that had not been destroyed by the hail. Nothing that was green was left on any plant or on any tree,
anywhere in Egypt. 
\p
\v 16 The king quickly summoned Aaron and Moses/me and said, “I have sinned against Yahweh, your god, and against you
\add two\add*. 
\v 17 So now I ask you to forgive me this one time \add for having\add* sinned, and pray to Yahweh your god to take away this
\add destruction\add* \f + \fr metonymy \f* \add which will cause us\add* to die.”
\p
\v 18 They/We left the king, and Moses/I prayed to Yahweh. 
\v 19 Then Yahweh changed the wind so that it blew \add strongly\add* from the west, and it blew all the locusts into the Red
Sea \f + \fr (OR, the Gulf of Suez) \f*. There was not one locust left anywhere in the country of Egypt.
\p
\v 20 But Yahweh made the king stubborn [IDI] \add again\add*, and he did not let the Israeli people go.
\s Yahweh caused a great darkness to cover Egypt 
\p
\v 21 Yahweh said to Moses/me, “Reach your hand up toward the sky, in order that there will be darkness over all the land of
Egypt, a darkness \add so complete\add* that people will have to grope around
\add to know where to walk\add*.” 
\v 22 So Moses/I reached his/my hand toward the sky, and it became totally dark all over Egypt for three days
\add and nights\add*. 
\v 23 People could not see each other. No one left his house during that whole time. But there was light in the area where the
Israeli people were living. 
\p
\v 24 The king summoned Moses/me and said, “All right, you may go and worship Yahweh.
\add Your wives and\add* your children may go with you. But your flocks of sheep and goats and your herds of cattle must remain
here.” 
\v 25 But Moses/I replied, “\add No\add*, you must let us \add take along the sheep and goats, in
order\add* that we may have \add some of them\add* to sacrifice and give as burned offerings to Yahweh, our God.
\v 26 Our livestock must also go with us; we are not going to leave one of them \f + \fr synecdoche \f* behind. We must take them to worship
Yahweh. We will not know \add which animals to sacrifice\add* until we get to where we are going.”
\p
\v 27 But Yahweh made the king \add continue to be\add* stubborn [IDI], and he would not let
\add the Israeli\add* people go. 
\v 28 The king said to them, “Get out of here! Make sure that you never come to see me \f + \fr synecdoche \f* again! The day you see me again,
\add I will have\add* you executed!” 
\v 29 Moses/I replied, “You are correct! You will never see me \f + \fr synecdoche \f* again!”
