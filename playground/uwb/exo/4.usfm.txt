\c 4  
\s After Moses tried to resist Yahweh's appointment, Yahweh gave him power to perform miracles
\p
\v 1 Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* replied, “But what if \add the Israeli people\add* do not believe me\f + \ft Or: are not convinced \f* or do what I tell them?
What if they say, ‘Yahweh did not appear to you!’” 
\v 2 Yahweh said to him\f + \ft Or: me \f*, “\add Look at\add* that thing you are holding in your hand. What is it?” He\f + \ft Or: I \f* replied, “A walking
stick\f + \ft Or: shepherd's stick \f*.” 
\v 3 He said, “Throw it down on the ground!” So, he\f + \ft Or: I \f* threw it on the ground, and it became a snake! And he\f + \ft Or: I \f* ran\f + \ft Or: jumped \f* away
from it. 
\v 4 But Yahweh said to Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f*, “Reach down and pick it up by its tail!” So he\f + \ft Or: I \f* reached down and caught it, and
\add when he\f + \ft Or: I \f* picked it up\add*, it became a stick in his\f + \ft Or: my \f* hand
\add again\add*! 
\p
\v 5 Yahweh said, “\add Do the same thing in front of the Israeli
people\add*, in order that they may believe that \add I\add*, Yahweh God, the one Abraham and Isaac and Jacob worshiped, truly
appeared to you.” 
\p
\v 6 Yahweh spoke to Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f* again, saying “Put your hand inside your robe \f + \ft metonymy \f*!” He\f + \ft Or: I \f* did that. And when he\f + \ft Or: I \f* took it out
again, surprisingly, his\f + \ft Or: my \f* hand was white. It had a skin disease
\add that made it\add* as white as snow. 
\v 7 Then God said, “Put your hand back inside your robe \f + \ft metonymy \f*!” So he\f + \ft Or: I \f* did that, and when he\f + \ft Or: I \f* took it out again,
surprisingly, it was normal again, just like the rest of his\f + \ft Or: my \f* body!
\v 8 God said, “\add You can do that in front of the Israeli people,
too\add*. If they do not pay attention to what you say because of
\add seeing\add* the first miracle, they will believe \add you\f + \ft Or: be convinced \f* when you
perform\add* the second miracle. 
\v 9 If they do not believe you or do what you say, even \add after you
perform\add* those two miracles, get some water from the Nile \add River\add* and pour it on the ground.
\add When you do that\add*, the water from the river, the water that you pour on the ground, will become blood \f + \ft metonymy \f* \f + \ft Or:
\add red like\add* blood).” 
\p
\v 10 Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* replied, “O Yahweh! I am not an eloquent \add speaker\add*! I was not an eloquent speaker before, and I have not
become one since you started talking to me! I am not a good speaker \f + \ft metonymy \f*, and I speak very slowly.”
\v 11 Then Yahweh said to him\f + \ft Or: me \f*, “\add You seem to forget\add* who it is that makes people able to speak \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*! Who is it that
enables people to be unable to speak or unable to hear, or able to see or not to see? It is I, Yahweh \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*!
\v 12 So start going \add to Egypt\add*, and I will help you to speak \f + \ft metonymy \f*, and I will tell you what you should say.”
\v 13 But he\f + \ft Or: I \f* replied, “O, Yahweh, I ask you, please send someone else
\add instead\add*!” 
\p
\v 14 Then Yahweh became very angry with Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f*. He said, “\add What
about\add* your \add older\add* brother Aaron, who is \add also\add* a descendant of Levi? I know that he is a very
good\f + \ft Or: eloquent \f* speaker. He is actually on his way here \add right
now\add*, and he will be very happy to see you. 
\v 15 You can keep talking to him and telling him what to say \f + \ft metonymy \f*, and I will help both of you \f + \ft synecdoche \f* to know what to say
\f + \ft metonymy \f*. And I will tell you both what you should do. 
\v 16 He will speak for you to the \add Israeli\add* people. He will be your spokesman\f + \ft Or: as though he was your mouth \f* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, and
you will be as though you are \add his\add* god. 
\v 17  \add Be sure\add* to take with you the walking\f + \ft Or: shepherd \f*'s stick
\add that is in your hand\add*, because you will perform miracles with it.”
\s God's instructions to Moses after Moses returned to Egypt 
\p
\v 18 Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* returned to his\f + \ft Or: my \f* father-in-law Jethro and said to him, “Please let me go back to Egypt, to see my fellow
Israelis there. I want to know if they are still alive.” Jethro said to Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f*, “Go, and may
\add God give you\add* \add inner\add* peace.” 
\p
\v 19 Yahweh said to Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f* \add before he\f + \ft Or: I \f* left\add* Midian, “You can
\add safely\add* return to Egypt, because the men who were wanting to kill you \f + \ft metonymy \f* are
\add now\add* dead.” 
\v 20 So Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* took his\f + \ft Or: my \f* wife and sons and put them on donkeys, and they\f + \ft Or: we \f* returned to Egypt. And Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* took in his\f + \ft Or: my \f*
hand the stick that God \add told him\f + \ft Or: me \f* to take along\add*. 
\p
\v 21 Yahweh said to Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f*, “When you return to Egypt, be sure to perform all the miracles that I have given you power
\add to do\add*, while the king is watching. But I will make him stubborn [IDI], with the result that he will not let the
Israeli people leave \add Egypt\add*. 
\v 22 Then say to him, ‘This is what Yahweh says: “The Israeli \add people\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* are
\add as dear to\add* me as firstborn sons \f + \ft metaphor \f*. 
\v 23 I told you to let my people \f + \ft metonymy \f* leave \add Egypt\add*, in order that they may worship me
\add in the desert\add*. If you refuse to let them go, I warn you, I will kill your firstborn son!” ’ ”
\s Zipporah circumcised her son 
\p
\v 24  \add One night\add*, as they were camping on the way \add to
Egypt\add*, Yahweh appeared to Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f*. He wanted\f + \ft Or: threatened \f* to kill Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f*
\add for disobeying his command that boys\f + \ft Or: sons \f* be circumcised\add*.
\v 25 Then \add his\f + \ft Or: my \f* wife\add* Zipporah took a flint knife and circumcised her son. Then she touched the boy's feet (OR,
genitals \f* with the piece of skin \add she had cut off\add*, and she said, “The blood
\add which flowed when I\add* \add circumcised you\add* will protect you
\add from being harmed by Yahweh\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*.” 
\v 26 She said to him, “You are safe now \f + \ft metaphor \f* because you have been circumcised.” So Yahweh did not harm her son.
\s The Israeli people believed Moses when he and Aaron talked to them
\p
\v 27 Yahweh said to Aaron, “Go into the desert to meet\f + \ft Or: see \f* Moses!” So he went
\add there from Egypt\add* and met him\f + \ft Or: me \f* at \add Sinai\add*, the mountain dedicated to God, and
\add greeted him\f + \ft Or: me \f* by\add* kissing him\f + \ft Or: me \f* \add on the cheek\add*.
\v 28 Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* told Aaron everything that Yahweh had said to him\f + \ft Or: me \f* when he told him\f + \ft Or: me \f* to return to Egypt. He\f + \ft Or: I \f* also told Aaron
about all the miracles that Yahweh told him\f + \ft Or: me \f* to perform. 
\p
\v 29  \add So Aaron and Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f*\add* returned \add to Egypt\add*. There they\f + \ft Or: we \f* gathered together all the Israeli
elders\f + \ft Or: leaders \f*. 
\v 30 Aaron told them everything that Yahweh had told Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f*, and he performed
\add all\add* the miracles as the people watched. 
\v 31 They believed \add that what they\f + \ft Or: we \f* were saying was true\add*. When they heard that Yahweh had seen how the Israeli
people were being cruelly oppressed and that he was going to help them, they bowed down and worshiped
\add Yahweh\add*.
