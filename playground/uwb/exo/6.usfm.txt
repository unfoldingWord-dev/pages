\c 6  
\s Yahweh promised to rescue them 
\p
\v 1 Then Yahweh said to Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f*, “Now you will see what I will do to the king
\add and his people\add*. I will powerfully \f + \ft metonymy \f* compel him to let my people go. In fact, by my power \f + \ft metonymy \f*
\add I will force\add* him to expel them from his land!” 
\p
\v 2 God also said to Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f*, “I am Yahweh. 
\v 3 I am the one who appeared to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and
\add told them that I\add* was God Almighty, but I did not \add tell\add* them that my name
\add was Yahweh\add*. 
\v 4 I also made my solemn agreement with them, promising to give them Canaan land. That was the land in which they were living
as foreigners. 
\v 5 Furthermore, I have heard the Israeli people as they were groaning
\add because of the hard work that\add* the Egyptians forced them to do as their slaves. I have thought about that solemn
promise \add that I made\add*. 
\v 6 So tell the Israeli people that \add I said this:\add* ‘I am Yahweh. I will free you from the burdens
\add of heavy work\add* that the Egyptians \add have given you\add*. I will free you from being their slaves. With my great
power \f + \ft metonymy \f* and by punishing them \f + \ft metonymy \f* very severely, I will save you.
\v 7 I will cause you to be my own people, and I will be your God,
\add the one you worship\add*. You will truly know that I am Yahweh God, the one who has freed you from the burdens
\add of work as slaves\add* of the Egyptians. 
\v 8 And I will bring you to the land that I solemnly promised to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. You will possess it
\add forever\add*. I, Yahweh, am \add promising this\add*.’ ” 
\p
\v 9 Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* told that to the Israeli people, but they did not believe what he\f + \ft Or: I \f* said. They were very discouraged [IDI] because
of the hard work \add they had been forced to do as slaves\add*.
\s Aaron and Moses gave God's message to the king again 
\p
\v 10 Yahweh said to Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f*, 
\v 11 “Go and tell the king of Egypt \add again\add* that he must allow the Israeli people to leave his land!”
\v 12 But Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* said to Yahweh, “Listen \add to what I am saying\add*.
\add Even\add* the Israeli people have not paid attention to what I
\add told them\add*. I am a poor speaker. [MET, MTY] So ◄why should the king pay attention to what I tell him?\f + \ft Or: the \f* king will
certainly not pay attention to what I \add tell him\add*!►” \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 13 But Yahweh spoke to Aaron and Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f* and commanded them\f + \ft Or: us \f*, “Tell the Israeli people and the king of Egypt that I have
\add commissioned you two\add* to lead the Israeli people out of Egypt.”
\s The ancestors of Moses and Aaron 
\p
\v 14 Here is\f + \ft Or: I will now give you \f* a list of the ancestors of \add Moses and
Aaron\add*: 
\p The sons of Reuben, who was Jacob's oldest son, \add were\add* Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi. They were
\add ancestors of\add* the clans \add that have those same names\add*.
\p
\v 15 The sons of Simeon \add were\add* Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul. Shaul's mother was a woman from the
Canaan people-group. They also were \add ancestors of\add* clans
\add that have those same names\add*. 
\p
\v 16 These are the names of the sons of Levi, in the order in which they were born: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. Levi was 137
years old \add when he died\add*. 
\p
\v 17 The sons of Gershon \add were\add* Libni and Shimei. They were ancestors of clans that have those names.
\p
\v 18 The sons of Kohath \add were\add* Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel. Kohath was 133 years old
\add when\add* he \add died\add*. 
\p
\v 19 The sons of Merari \add were\add* Mahli and Mushi. All of those people whose names
\add I have listed\add* belonged to tribes\f + \ft Or: clans \f* descended from Levi, in the order in which they were born.
\p
\v 20 Amram married his father's sister, Jochebed. She was the mother of Aaron and Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f*. Amram was 137 years old
\add when he\add* \add died\add*. 
\p
\v 21 The sons of Izhar were Korah, Nepheg, and Zichri. 
\p
\v 22 The sons of Uzziel were Mishael, Elzaphan, and Sithri. 
\p
\v 23 Aaron married Elisheba. She was the daughter of Amminadab and sister of Nahshon. Elisheba gave birth to
\add four sons\add*, Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. 
\p
\v 24 The sons of Korah \add were\add* Assir, Elkanah, and Abiasaph. They were the ancestors of the Korah people-group.
\p
\v 25 Aaron's son Eleazar married one of the daughters of Putiel, and she gave birth to Phinehas.
\add That ends the list of\add* the families and clans that were descended from Levi.
\v 26 Aaron and Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* were the ones to whom Yahweh said, “Lead all the families and clans of the Israeli people out of
Egypt.” 
\v 27 They\f + \ft Or: We \f* were the ones who spoke to the king of Egypt about bringing the Israeli people out of Egypt.
\v 28 On the day that Yahweh spoke to Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f* in Egypt, 
\v 29 he said, “I am Yahweh. You must tell the king everything that I say to you.”
\v 30 But Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* said to Yahweh, “Listen to me. I am not a good speaker. [MET, MTY] So why should the king pay attention to
what I tell him?\f + \ft Or: the king will certainly not pay attention to what I say \f*!” \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
