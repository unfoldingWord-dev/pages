\c 24  
\s The Israelis accepted Yahweh's agreement 
\p
\v 1 Then Yahweh said to Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f*, “Come up to me \add on top of this
mountain\add*, you and Aaron and \add his sons\add* Nadab and Abihu. Also
\add take along\add* seventy of the Israeli elders\f + \ft Or: leaders \f*. While you are still some distance
\add from the top of the mountain\add*, prostrate yourselves \add on the
ground\add* and worship me. 
\v 2 Moses, \add I will allow\add* you alone to come near to me. The others must not come near, and the
\add rest of the\add* people must not come up the mountain.” 
\p
\v 3 Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* went and told the people everything that Yahweh had said and all that he had commanded. The people all replied
together, saying, “We will do everything that Yahweh has told us
\add to do\add*.” 
\v 4 Then Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* wrote down everything that Yahweh had commanded. Early the next morning Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* built a
\add stone\add* altar. He\f + \ft Or: I \f* also set up twelve stones, one for each of the Israeli tribes.
\v 5 He\f + \ft Or: I \f* also selected some young men. They burned sacrifices to Yahweh and they also sacrificed some cattle that were not
burned completely, for the purpose of restoring fellowship with other people.
\v 6 Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* took half of the blood of the animals that were slaughtered and put it in bowls. The other half of the blood
\add he\f + \ft Or: I \f*\add* threw\f + \ft Or: splashed \f* against the altar. 
\v 7 Then he\f + \ft Or: I \f* took the scroll on which he\f + \ft Or: I \f* had written \add everything that Yahweh had commanded
in\add* the agreement that he had made, and he read it \add aloud\add*, while all the people were listening. Then all the
people said, “We will do all that Yahweh has told us to do. We will obey
\add everything\add*.” 
\p
\v 8 Then Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* took the blood \add that was in the bowls\add* and threw\f + \ft Or: splashed \f* it on the people. He\f + \ft Or: I \f* said, “This is the
blood \add that confirms\f + \ft Or: puts into effect \f*\add* the agreement that Yahweh has made with you when he gave you all these
commands.” 
\p
\v 9 Then Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f*, along with Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and the seventy Israeli elders\f + \ft Or: leaders \f*, went up
\add the mountain\add*, 
\v 10 and they saw God, the whom one the Israeli people worship. Under his feet was something like a pavement
\add made of\add* \add expensive blue stones called\add* sapphires. They were as clear as the sky is
\add when there are no clouds\add*. 
\v 11 God did not harm \f + \ft metonymy \f* those Israeli elders\f + \ft Or: leaders \f* \add because of their having seen
him\add*. They saw God, and they ate and drank together! \add Then they all went down the
mountain\add*. 
\p
\v 12 Then Yahweh said to Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f*, “Come up to me \add again\add* on
\add top of this\add* mountain. While you are here, I will give you
\add two\add* stone slabs on which I have written all the laws \f + \ft doublet \f* that I have given to you to instruct\f + \ft Or: teach \f*
\add the people\add*.” 
\v 13-14 So Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* told the elders, “Stay here \add with the other
people\add* until we return! Do not forget that Aaron and Hur will be with you. So if anyone has a dispute
\add while I am gone\add*, he can go to those two men.” Then Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* went with his\f + \ft Or: my \f* servant Joshua
\add part of the way\add* up the mountain that \add was dedicated
to\add* God. 
\v 15 Then Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* went the \add rest of the way\add* up the mountain. A cloud covered the mountain.
\v 16 The glory\f + \ft Or: brilliant light \f* of Yahweh came down on the mountain and covered it for six days. On the seventh day, Yahweh
called to Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f* from the middle of the cloud. 
\v 17 When the Israeli people \add looked at\add* the top of the mountain, the glory of Yahweh was like a big fire that was
burning \add there\add*. 
\v 18 Moses\f + \ft Or: I \f* went into the cloud on top of the mountain. He\f + \ft Or: I \f* was there for forty days and nights.
