\c 19  
\s Saul tried to kill David 
\p
\v 1 Then Saul urged all his servants and his son Jonathan to kill David. But Jonathan liked David very much.
\v 2 So he warned David, “My father Saul is seeking for a way to kill you. So be careful. Tomorrow morning go and find a place
to hide \add in the field\add*. 
\v 3 I will ask my father to go out there with me. \add While we are out
there\add*, I will talk to him about you. Then I will tell you everything that he tells me.”
\add So David did what Jonathan told him to do\add*. 
\p
\v 4  \add The next morning\add*, Jonathan spoke with his father, saying many good things about David. He said, “You should
never do anything to harm your servant David! He has never done anything to harm you! Everything that he has done has helped
you very much. 
\v 5 He was in danger of being killed when he fought against \add Goliath, the great soldier
of\add* the Philistia \add army. By enabling David to kill him\add*, Yahweh won a great victory for all the people of Israel.
You were very happy when you saw that. Why would you want to do anything now to harm David \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*? There is no reason for you to
kill him, because he has not done anything wrong!” 
\p
\v 6 Saul listened to what Jonathan said. Then Saul said, “I solemnly promise that just as certain as Yahweh lives, I will not
kill David.” 
\p
\v 7 Afterward, Jonathan summoned David and told him what he and Saul had said. Then Jonathan brought David to Saul, and David
served Saul as he had done before. 
\p
\v 8 One day a war started again, and David \add led his soldiers
to\add* fight against the Philistia army. David's \add army\add* attacked them very furiously, with the result that the
Philistia army ran away. 
\p
\v 9 But one day when Saul was sitting in his house, an evil spirit
\add sent\add* from Yahweh \add suddenly\add* came upon Saul. While David was playing his harp
\add for Saul\add*, 
\v 10 Saul hurled his spear at David to try to fasten him to the wall. David dodged\f + \ft Or: jumped to one side \f*, and the spear did not
hit him. The spear stuck in the wall, but David ran out into the darkness and escaped.
\s Michal helped David to escape 
\p
\v 11 Then Saul sent messengers to David's house. He told them to watch the house and to kill David
\add while he was leaving the house\add* the following morning. But David's wife Michal
\add saw them and\add* warned him, saying, “To save your life, you must run away tonight, because if you do not do that, you
will be killed tomorrow!” 
\v 12 So she enabled David to climb out through a window, and he ran away and escaped.
\v 13 Then Michal took an idol and put it in the bed. She covered it with some
\add of David's\add* clothes, and put some goat's hair on the head of the idol.
\p
\v 14 When the messengers came \add to the house the next morning\add*, she told them that David was sick
\add and could not get out of bed\add*. 
\p
\v 15  \add When they reported that to Saul\add*, he told them to go back to David's house. He said to them, “Bring him to me
lying on his bed, in order that I can kill him!” 
\v 16 But when those men entered David's house, they saw that there was only an idol in the bed, with goat's hair on its head.
\p
\v 17  \add When they reported that to Saul, Saul summoned\add* Michal and said to her, “Why did you trick me like that? You
allowed my enemy to escape!” 
\p Michal replied to Saul, “David told me that if I did not help him to escape, he would kill me!” \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\s God's spirit came on Saul 
\p
\v 18 After David had escaped from Saul, he went to Samuel, who was
\add at his home\add* at Ramah. He told Samuel everything that Saul had done to
\add try to kill\add* him. Then David and Samuel went to Naioth,
\add which was a section\add* of \add Ramah city\add*, and they stayed there.
\v 19 Someone told Saul that David was in Naioth. 
\v 20 So Saul sent some messengers to capture David. When those messengers
\add arrived in Ramah\add*, they met some men who were proclaiming ecstatic messages, and Samuel was there, being their leader.
When Saul's messengers met them, the Spirit of God came upon Saul's men, and they also spoke ecstatically.
\v 21 When Saul heard about that, he sent more messengers, but they also started to speak ecstatically.
\v 22 Finally, Saul also went to Ramah. When he arrived at the well at
\add a place named\add* Secu, he asked people there, “Where are Samuel and David?”
\p The people replied, “They are at Naioth in Ramah \add city\add*.”
\v 23 While Saul was walking toward Naioth, the Spirit of God also came upon him.
\add While he walked on\add*, he continued speaking ecstatic messages until he came to Naioth.
\v 24 There he took off his \add outer\add* clothes, and he spoke messages from God in front of Samuel. He lay on the ground
doing that all day and all night. That is the reason that \add when people see someone doing something that is very
unexpected\add*, they say, “Is Saul also a prophet?” \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
