\c 30  
\s David's army defeated the Amalekites 
\p
\v 1 Three days later, when David and his men arrived at Ziklag,
\add they discovered that\add* men of the Amalek people-group had raided Ziklag and
\add towns in\add* the southern part of Judah. They had destroyed Ziklag and burned down all the buildings.
\v 2 They had captured the women \add and the children\add* and everyone else, and had taken them away. But they had not killed
anyone. 
\p
\v 3 When David and his men came to Ziklag, they saw that the town had been burned, and that their wives and sons and daughters
had been captured and taken away. 
\v 4 David and his men cried loudly, until \add they were so weak
that\add* they could not cry \add anymore\add*. 
\v 5 David's two wives, Ahinoam and Abigail, had also been taken away.
\v 6 David's men were threatening to \add kill\add* him \add by throwing\add* stones at him, because they were very angry
because their sons and daughters \add had been taken away\add*. David was very distressed, but Yahweh his God gave him
strength. 
\p
\v 7 Then David \add did not know what to do, so\add* he said to Abiathar the priest, “Bring to me the sacred vest.” So
Abiathar brought it, 
\v 8 and David asked Yahweh, “Should I \add and my men\add* pursue the men
\add who took our families\add*? Will we \add be able to\add* catch up to them?”
\p Yahweh answered \add by means of the stones in the sacred pouch\add*, “Yes, pursue them. You will catch up to them, and you
will be able to rescue \add your families\add*.” 
\v 9 So David and the 600 men who were with him left, and they came to Besor Ravine. Some of his men stayed there
\add with some of their supplies\add*. 
\v 10 David and 400 men continued to pursue \add the men who captured their
families\add*. The other 200 men stayed there at the ravine, because they were so exhausted that they could not cross the
ravine. 
\p
\v 11  \add As David and the 400 men were going\add*, they saw a man from Egypt in a field; so they took him to David. They
gave the man some water to drink and some food to eat. 
\v 12 They also gave him a piece of fig cake and two clusters/packs of raisins. The man had not had anything to eat or drink
for three days and nights, but \add after he ate and drank\add* he felt refreshed.
\p
\v 13 David asked him, “Who is your master? And where do you come from?”
\p He replied, “I am from Egypt. I am a slave of a man from the Amalek people-group. Three days ago my master left me here,
because I was sick \add and I was not able to go with them\add*.
\v 14 We had raided the southern part of Judah where the Kereth people-group live, and some other towns in Judah, and the area
south \add of Hebron city\add* where the descendants of Caleb live. We also burned Ziklag
\add town\add*.” 
\p
\v 15 David asked him, “Can you lead us to this group of raiders?”
\p He replied, “Yes, \add I will do that\add* if you ask God to listen while you promise that you will not kill me or give me
back to my master. If you promise that, I will take you to them.”
\v 16  \add David agreed to do that\add*, so the man from Egypt led David
\add and his men\add* to where the men from the Amalek people-group were. Those men were lying on the ground, eating and
drinking and celebrating because of having captured many things from the Philistia and Judah areas.
\v 17 David \add and his men\add* fought against them from sunset that day until the evening of the following day. Four hundred
of them escaped and rode away on camels, but none of the others escaped.
\v 18 David rescued his two wives, and he and his men got back everything else that the men of the Amalek people-group had
taken. 
\v 19 Nothing was missing. They took all their people back \add to
Ziklag\add*—young people and old people, \add their wives\add*, their sons and their daughters. They also recovered all the
other things that the men of the Amalek people-group had taken from Ziklag.
\v 20 They took with them the sheep and cattle that had been captured, and his men caused these animals to go in front of them,
saying, “These are animals that we captured in the battle; they belong to David!”
\p
\v 21 David and his men got back to where the other 200 men were waiting, the men who did not go with David because they were
very exhausted. They had stayed at Besor Ravine. \add When they saw David and his men
coming\add*, they went out to greet them. And David \add greeted them
and\add* said to them, “I hope that things are going well with you!”
\p
\v 22 But some of the men who had gone with David, men who were evil and troublemakers, said, “These two hundred men did not go
with us. So we should not give to them any of the things that we recovered/captured. Each of them should take only his wife and
children and go \add back to their homes\add*.” 
\p
\v 23 David replied, “No, my fellow Israelis, that would not be right. Yahweh has protected us and enabled us to defeat the
enemies who attacked our town. 
\v 24 ◄Who will pay attention to you if you say things like that?/No one will pay attention to you if you say things like
that.► \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* The men who stayed here with our supplies will get the same amount that the men who went into the battle will get.
They will all receive the same amount.” 
\v 25 David made that to be a law \f + \fk doublet \f* for the Israeli people, and that is still a law in Israel.
\p
\v 26 When David \add and all the others\add* arrived in Ziklag, David sent to his friends who were leaders in Judah some of
the things that they had captured from the Amalek people-group. He said to them, “Here is a present for you. These are things
that we took from Yahweh's enemies.” 
\p
\v 27  \add Here is a list of the cities and towns to whose leaders David sent
gifts:\add* Bethel, Ramoth in the southern part of Judah, Jattir,
\v 28 Aroer, Siphmoth, Eshtemoa, 
\v 29 Racal, the cities where the descendants of Jehrameel and the cities where the Ken people-group live,
\v 30 Hormah, Bor-Ashan, Athach, 
\v 31 Hebron, and all the other places where David and his men had gone.
