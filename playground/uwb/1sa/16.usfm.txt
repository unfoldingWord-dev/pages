\c 16  
\s Samuel appointed David to be king 
\p
\v 1 Finally, Yahweh said to Samuel, “I have decided that I will not allow Saul to continue to be the king. So you should not
\f + \fk rhetorical question \f* keep feeling sad \add about what he has done\add*. Put some olive oil in a small container and go to Bethlehem
\add to anoint someone with the oil, and appoint him to be king\add*. I am sending you there to a man named Jesse, because I
have chosen one of his sons to be the king \add of Israel\add*.”
\p
\v 2 But Samuel said, “I am afraid \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* to do that! If Saul hears about it, he will kill me!” Yahweh said, “Take a
◄heifer/young female cow► with you, and say to people that you have come to
\add kill it and\add* offer it as a sacrifice to me. 
\p
\v 3 Invite Jesse to come to the sacrifice. \add When he comes\add*, I will show you what you should do. And I will show you
which of his sons \add I have chosen to be the king\add*. Then you should anoint him
\add with the olive oil to be the king\add*.” 
\p
\v 4 Samuel did what Yahweh told him to do. He went to Bethlehem. When the town leaders came to him, they trembled,
\add because they were worried that Samuel had come to rebuke them about
something\add*. One of them asked him, “Have you come \add to speak\add* peacefully
\add to us\add*?” 
\p
\v 5 Samuel replied, “Yes. I have come peacefully, to make a sacrifice to Yahweh.
\add Perform the rituals to\add* make yourselves acceptable to Yahweh, and then come with me to where they will offer the
sacrifice.” Then Samuel performed the ritual to make Jesse and his sons acceptable to God, and he also invited them to the
sacrifice. 
\p
\v 6 When they arrived there, Samuel looked at \add Jesse's oldest
son\add* Eliab, and thought, “Surely this is the one whom Yahweh has appointed
\add be king\add*!” 
\p
\v 7 But Yahweh said to Samuel, “Do not think \add that he is the one whom I have
chosen\add* because of his being handsome and very tall, because I have not chosen him. I do not evaluate people as people do.
You people evaluate people by their appearance, but I evaluate people by what is in their inner beings.”
\p
\v 8 Then Jesse told \add his next oldest son\add* Abinadab to step forward and walk in front of Samuel.
\add But when he did that\add*, Samuel said, “Yahweh has not chosen this one, either.”
\v 9 Then Jesse told \add his next oldest son\add* Shammah to step forward. He stepped forward, but Samuel said, “Yahweh has
not chosen this one, either.” 
\v 10 Similarly, Jesse told his other four sons to walk in front of Samuel. But Samuel said to Jesse, “Yahweh has not chosen
any of these sons of yours.” 
\v 11 Then Samuel asked Jesse, “Do you have any other sons?” Jesse replied, “My youngest son
\add is not here\add*; he is out \add in the fields\add* taking care of the sheep.” Samuel said, “Send someone to bring him
here! We will not sit down \add to eat\add* until he gets here.”
\p
\v 12 So Jesse sent \add someone to bring David there. And when David arrived, Samuel saw
that\add* he was handsome and healthy, and had bright eyes. Then Yahweh said, “This is the one
\add whom I have chosen\add*; anoint him \add to be king\add*.” 
\p
\v 13 So as David \add stood there\add* in front of his older brothers, Samuel took the container of oil that he had brought
and poured some of it on David's head \add to set him apart to serve God. After they all ate, Samuel left
there\add* and returned to Ramah. But Yahweh's Spirit came on David powerfully, and stayed with David for the rest of his life.
\s David played the harp for Saul 
\p
\v 14 But Yahweh's Spirit left Saul. Instead \add of his Spirit staying with
Saul\add*, Yahweh sent an evil spirit to Saul to terrify him \add repeatedly\add*.
\p
\v 15 One of his servants said to him, “It is evident that an evil spirit sent by God is terrifying you.
\v 16 So \add we suggest that\add* you allow us your servants here to search for a man who plays the harp well. He can play the
harp whenever the evil spirit bothers you. Then \add you will calm down
and\add* you will be okay again.” 
\p
\v 17 Saul replied, “\add Fine/Okay\add*, find for me a man who can play
\add the harp\add* well, and bring him to me.” 
\p
\v 18 One of his servants said to him, “A man named Jesse, in Bethlehem
\add town\add*, has a son who plays the harp very well. Furthermore, he is a brave man, and is a capable soldier. He is
handsome and he always speaks wisely. And Yahweh always protects him.”
\p
\v 19 So Saul sent some messengers to Jesse. He told \add them to say to
Jesse\add*, “Send your son David to me, the one who takes care of sheep.”
\v 20  \add So after they went and told that\add* to Jesse, he \add agreed
and\add* got a young goat, a container of wine, a donkey on which he put some loaves of bread and gave them to David to take to
Saul \add as a present\add*. 
\p
\v 21 Then David went to Saul and started to work for him. Saul liked David very much, and he became the man who carried Saul's
weapons \add when Saul went to fight in battles\add*. 
\v 22 Then Saul sent \add a messenger to go\add* to Jesse and tell him, “I am pleased with David. Please let him stay here and
work for me.” 
\p
\v 23  \add Jesse agreed, and after that\add*, whenever the evil spirit whom God sent tormented Saul, David played the harp.
Then Saul would become calm, and the evil spirit would leave him.
