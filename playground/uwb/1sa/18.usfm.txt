\c 18  
\s Saul became jealous of David 
\p
\v 1 After David finished talking with Saul, he \add met Saul's son\add*, Jonathan. Jonathan
\add immediately\add* liked David; in fact, he began to love\f + \ft Or: like \f* him as much as he loved\f + \ft Or: liked \f* himself.
\v 2 From that day, Saul kept David with him, and did not let him return home.
\v 3 Because he loved David so much, Jonathan made a solemn agreement with David.
\add They promised each other that they would always be friends\add*.
\v 4 Jonathan took off his own outer robe and gave it to David. He also gave David his soldier's tunic, his sword, his bow
\add and arrows\add*, and his belt. 
\p
\v 5 David \add went wherever Saul sent him. And\add* whatever Saul told him to do, David did it very successfully. As a
result, Saul appointed David to be a commander in the army. All the officers and other men in the army approved of\f + \ft Or: were very
pleased with \f* that. 
\p
\v 6 But, when the men in the army were returning home after David had killed Goliath, the women came out from many \f + \ft hyperbole \f* towns
in Israel to meet\f + \ft Or: greet \f* King Saul. They were singing and dancing very joyfully, playing tambourines and lyres.
\v 7 As they danced, they sang this song to each other: 
\q "Saul has killed a thousand \add enemy soldiers\add*, 
\q2 But David has killed ten thousand \add of them\add*." 
\p
\v 8 When Saul \add heard them singing that\add*, he did not like it. He became very angry. He said
\add to himself\add*, "They are saying that David \add killed\add* ten thousand men, but that I
\add have killed\add* only one thousand. Soon they will want to make him their king!" \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 9 From that time, Saul watched David very closely because he was suspicious
\add that David would try to become king\add*. 
\p
\v 10 The next day, an evil spirit sent by God suddenly took control of Saul. He began to act like a madman, inside his house.
David was playing the lyre for him, as he did every day. Saul was holding a spear in his hand,
\v 11 and he hurled it \add at David\add*, saying to himself, "I will fasten David to the wall with the spear!" He did that two
times, but David jumped aside \add both times\add*. 
\p
\v 12  \add Because it became evident that\add* Yahweh had abandoned Saul but that he was helping David, Saul was afraid of
David. 
\v 13 So he appointed David as a commander of a thousand soldiers and sent David away from him,
\add hoping that David would be killed in a battle\add*. But when David led his soldiers
\add in their battles\add*, 
\v 14 he always had great success, because Yahweh was helping him.
\v 15 When Saul heard that David \add and his soldiers were\add* very successful, he became more afraid of David.
\v 16 But all the people of Israel and of Judah loved David, because he led the soldiers very successfully
\add in the battles\add*. 
\s David married Saul's daughter 
\p
\v 17 One day Saul said to David, "I am ready to give you my oldest daughter, Merab, to be your wife. I will do that if you
serve me bravely by fighting battles for Yahweh \add against the
Philistines\add*". He said that because he thought, "I will not try to get rid of David by myself. I will allow the Philistines
to do that." 
\p
\v 18 But David said to Saul, "I am not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* a very important person, and my family is not very important, and my clan is not
a very important Israeli clan. So I do not deserve to become your son-in-law." \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 19 So, when it was time for Merab to be given to David to become his wife, instead, Saul gave her to a man named Adriel,
from Meholah \add town\add*. 
\p
\v 20 But Saul's other daughter, Michal, fell in love with David. When they told Saul about that, he was pleased.
\v 21 He thought, "I will let Michal marry him, in order that she may trap him, and the Philistines will be able to kill him."
So he said to David, \add "You can marry Michal\add*," and by saying that, he indicated for the second time that David would
become his son-in-law. 
\p
\v 22 Saul told his servants, "Talk to David privately, and say to him, 'Listen, the king is pleased with you, and all of us
his servants love you. So now \add we think that\add* you should
\add marry Michal and\add* become the king's son-in-law.' " 
\p
\v 23 So they told that to David. But David said, "It would be a great honor \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* to become the king's son-in-law. But
\add I do not think that I should do that, because\add* I am only a poor and insignificant man."
\p
\v 24 When the servants told Saul what David had said, 
\v 25 Saul replied, "Go and say to David, '\add In order for the king to allow you to marry Michal, he wants you to
kill\add* a hundred Philistines and to cut off their foreskins \add and bring the foreskins to him to prove that you have
killed them\add*. In that way he will get revenge on his enemies.' " But what Saul wanted was that the Philistines would kill
David \add while he was trying to kill them\add*. 
\p
\v 26 When the servants told that to David, he was very pleased that he could become the king's son-in-law
\add by doing that. The king had said how many days he would allow for David to do
that\add*. But before that time ended, 
\v 27 David and his men went and killed, \add not a hundred\add*, but two hundred Philistines! He brought their foreskins to
Saul, and counted them \add while Saul was watching\add*, in order to prove that he had
\add fulfilled what the king required so that he could become Saul's son-in-law. So then Saul was
obligated\add* to allow David to marry his daughter Michal. 
\p
\v 28 But when Saul realized that Yahweh was helping David, and that his daughter loved David,
\v 29 he became more afraid of David. So, as long as Saul lived, he was David's enemy.
\p
\v 30 The Philistine armies repeatedly came to fight the Israelis, but every time they fought, David and his soldiers were more
successful than any of Saul's other army commanders. As a result, David became very famous.
