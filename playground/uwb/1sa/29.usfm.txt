\c 29  
\s The king of Philistia sent David back home 
\p
\v 1 The Philistia army gathered at Aphek \add Valley, which is near
Shunem\add*. The Israelis set up their tents at Jezreel \add city, which was in the same
valley\add*. 
\v 2 The kings of Philistia divided their men into groups; some groups had 100 soldiers and some groups had 1,000 soldiers.
David and his men were marching behind, with King Achish. 
\v 3 But the Philistia commanders asked, “What are these Hebrews
\add doing here, marching with us to battle\add*?” 
\p Achish replied, “\add Their leader\add* is David. He previously worked for King Saul of Israel, but now he has been living
near me for more than a year. During all the time since he left Saul, I have not seen/found that he has any faults.”
\v 4 But the Philistia army commanders were angry with Achish \add for allowing David's army to be going with
them\add*. They said to him, “Send David \add and his men\add* back to the city that you gave to him! We do not want him to go
with us into the battle. \add If he goes with us\add*, we will have an enemy in our own midst! He would please King Saul by
killing our own soldiers \f + \fk rhetorical question \f*! 
\v 5  \add Have you forgotten that\add* David is the one about whom the Israelis dance and sing, saying,
\q ‘Saul has killed a thousand of our enemies, 
\q2 but David has killed ten thousand of them!’?” 
\p
\v 6 So Achish summoned David, and said to him, “Just as surely as Yahweh lives, you have been loyal to me. I would like very
much for you to fight along with my army. Since the day that you came to me, I have not found/seen that you have any faults.
But the other kings do not trust you. 
\v 7 So all of you go back home, and I hope/desire that things will go well for you. I do not want you(sg) to do anything that
the other kings of Philistia will not be pleased with.” 
\p
\v 8 David replied, “What wrong have I done? Since the day that I first came to you until today, have I done anything that you
think is evil? Your majesty, why will you not allow me to go and fight against your enemies?”
\p
\v 9 Achish replied, “I know that you are as just as good as an angel from God. But the commanders of my army have said, ‘We
will not allow David \add and his men\add* to go with us into the battle.’
\v 10 So early tomorrow morning you and your men must leave. Get up as soon as it gets light and leave.”
\p
\v 11 So David and his men got up early the following morning and returned to the area where the Philistia people lived. And
the Philistia army went up to Jezreel.
