\c 13  
\s Saul disobeyed God 
\p
\v 1 Saul was no longer a young man when he became the king. He ruled Israel for forty-two years.
\p
\v 2  \add Several years after he became king\add*, he chose three thousand men from the Israeli army to go with him
\add to fight the Philistines\add*. Then he sent the other soldiers back home. Of the men he chose, two thousand stayed with
Saul at Micmash and in the hilly area near Bethel, and a thousand stayed with
\add Saul's son\add* Jonathan at Gibeah, in the area where the descendants of Benjamin lived.
\p
\v 3 Jonathan \add and the men who were with him\add* attacked the Philistine soldiers who were camped at Geba. The
\add other\add* Philistines heard about that. \add So Saul realized that the army of Philistia would probably come to fight the
Israelis again\add*. So Saul \add sent messengers to\add* blow trumpets throughout Israel
\add to gather the people together and\add* proclaim to them, “All you Hebrews need to hear
\add that now the Philistines will start a war with us\add*!” 
\v 4 The messengers told the rest of the army to gather together with Saul at Gilgal. And all the people in Israel heard the
news. People were saying, “Saul's army has attacked the Philistine camp, with the result that now the Philistines hate us
Israelis very much.” 
\p
\v 5 The Philistines gathered together and were given equipment to fight the Israelis. The Philistines had 3,000 chariots, and
6,000 chariot-drivers. Their soldiers \add seemed to be as many\add* as grains of sand on the seashore \f + \ft hyperbole \f*. They went up and
set up their tents at Micmash, to the east of Beth-Aven (\add which means ‘house of wickedness’, and really referred to Bethel
town\add*). 
\v 6 The Philistines attacked the Israelis very strongly, and the Israeli soldiers realized that they were in a very bad
situation. So many of the Israeli soldiers hid in caves and holes in the ground, or among the rocks, or in pits, or in wells.
\v 7 Some of them crossed the Jordan River at a place where it was very shallow. Then they went to the area where the
descendants of Gad lived and to the Gilead \add region\add*. 
\p But Saul stayed at Gilgal. All the soldiers who were with him were shaking
\add because they were so afraid\add*. 
\v 8 Saul waited seven days, which was the number of days that Samuel had told him to wait for him. But Samuel did not come to
Gilgal \add during that time\add*, so many of the men in Saul's army began to leave him and run away.
\v 9 So Saul said to the soldiers, “Bring to me an animal to be completely burned
\add on the altar\add* and one for the offering to enable us to continue to have fellowship
\add with God\add*.” \add So the men did that\add*. 
\v 10 And just as he was finished burning these offerings, Samuel arrived. Saul went to greet him.
\p
\v 11 Samuel \add saw what Saul had done\add*, and he said to Saul, “Why have you done this?” Saul replied, “I saw that my men
were leaving me and running away, and that you did not come here during the time that you said that you would come, and that
the Philistine army was gathering together at Micmash. 
\p
\v 12 So I thought, ‘The Philistine army is going to attack us here at Gilgal, and I have not yet asked Yahweh to bless\f + \ft Or: help \f*
us.’ So I felt it was necessary to offer the burnt offerings \add to seek God's
blessings\add*.” 
\p
\v 13 Samuel replied, “What you did was very foolish! You have not obeyed what Yahweh, your God, commanded
\add about sacrifices\add*. If you had obeyed him, God would have allowed you and your descendants to rule
\add Israel\add* for a long time. 
\v 14 But now \add because of what you have done, you will die, and after you
die\add*, none of your descendants will continue to rule. Yahweh is seeking for a man
\add to be king\add* who be just the kind of person that he wants him to be, so that he can appoint him to be the leader of his
people. Yahweh will do this because you have not obeyed what he commanded.”
\p
\v 15 Then Samuel left Gilgal and went up to Gibeah. Saul stayed at Gilgal with his soldiers. There were only about 600 of them
left \add who did not run away\add*. 
\s Saul's army had difficulties 
\p
\v 16 Saul and his son Jonathan and the soldiers who were with them went to Geba
\add city\add* in the area of the tribe of Benjamin \add and set up their tents
there\add*. The Philistine army set up their tents at Micmash. 
\v 17 Three groups of Philistia men soon left the place where the their army was staying, and went and make raids on the
Israeli towns\f + \ft Or: attacked the Israelis and took their possessions \f*. One group went
\add north\add* toward Ophrah \add city\add* in the Shual \add region\add*.
\v 18 One group went \add west\add* to Beth-Horon \add city\add*. The third group went toward the
\add Israeli\add* border, above Zeboim Valley, near the desert. 
\p
\v 19 At that time, there were no men in Israel who were blacksmiths\f + \ft Or: could make things from iron \f*.
\add The people of Philistia would not permit the Israelis to have men who could do that, because they were afraid
that\add* they would make iron swords and spears for the Hebrews to use.
\v 20 So \add whenever the Israelis needed\add* to sharpen the blades of their plows, or picks, or axes, or sickles, they were
forced to take those things to a Philistia man who could sharpen those things.
\v 21 They needed to pay one fourth of an ounce\f + \ft Or: 8 grams► of silver for sharpening a plow, and ◄an eighth of an ounce, Or: 4 grams \f*
of silver to sharpen an axe, or a sickle, or an ox goad\f + \ft Or: a pointed rod to jab an ox to make it walk \f*.
\p
\v 22 So \add because the Israelis could not make weapons from iron\add*, on the day that the Israelis fought
\add against the men of Philistia\add*, Saul and Jonathan were the only Israeli men who had swords. None of the others had a
sword; \add they had only bows and arrows\add*. 
\p
\v 23 Before the battle started, some Philistia men went to the pass\f + \ft Or: a narrow place between two cliffs \f* outside Micmash to
guard it.
