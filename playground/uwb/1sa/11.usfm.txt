\s Saul's army rescued the people of Jabesh 
\p
\v 1 About a month later, King Nahash of Ammon \add led his army across the Jordan
River\add*, and they surrounded Jabesh \add city\add* in the Gilead
\add region\add*. But all the men of Jabesh \add appointed someone
who\add* said to Nahash, “Make an agreement/treaty with us \add not to kill
us\add*, and then we will let you rule us.” 
\p
\v 2 Nahash replied, “I will do that if you do one thing. Allow us to gouge out all the right eyes of your people. By doing
that we will cause the people \add in other countries\add* to despise all you Israeli people.”
\p
\v 3 The leaders of Jabesh replied, “Do not attack us for the next seven days. During that time, we will send messengers
throughout Israel \add to tell them what you are demanding\add*. If no one will help us, then we will ◄surrender to you/allow
you to do to us whatever you want►.” 
\p
\v 4  \add Being very confident that his army was very superior, Nahash agreed. So the leaders of Jabesh sent messengers
throughout Israel\add*. When the messengers came to Gibeah, which was
\add the city\add* where Saul lived, and they told the people there about the situation, everyone started to cry.
\v 5 At that time, Saul was plowing in the field. When he returned home, he asked, “Why are all the people
\add crying\add*?” So they told him what the messengers from Jabesh had reported.
\p
\v 6 Then God's Spirit came powerfully upon Saul, and he became very angry
\add because of what Nahash wanted to do\add*. 
\v 7 He took two of his oxen \add and killed them\add* and cut them into pieces. Then he sent messengers
\add carrying those pieces\add* throughout Israel to tell people this message: “Saul says that
\add he cut this ox in pieces, and that he will do the same thing\add* to the oxen of anyone who refuses to come with him and
Samuel to fight \add the army from Ammon\add*!” Then Yahweh caused all the people of Israel to be afraid of what Saul might do
to them \f + \ft (OR, of what Yahweh might do to them) \f* \add if they did not go and help
Saul\add*. So the men all gathered together in unison. 
\v 8 When Saul gave them all weapons at Bezek, he saw that there were 300,000 Israeli men there, as well as 30,000 men from the
tribe of Judah. 
\p
\v 9 So Saul sent messengers back to the people at Jabesh to tell them, “We will rescue/save you by noontime tomorrow.” When
the people of Jabesh heard that message, they were very joyful/happy.
\v 10 Then the men of Jabesh told \add Nahash\add*, “Tomorrow we will surrender to you, and then you can do to us whatever you
want to.” 
\p
\v 11 But before the sun rose the next morning, Saul \add and his army
arrived\add*. He divided them into three groups. They rushed into the camp of the soldiers from Ammon, and attacked them. By
noontime they had killed most of them, and those who were not killed scattered. Each of them who ran away ran away alone.
\s The people proclaimed Saul as king 
\p
\v 12 Then the people \add of Jabesh\add* said to Samuel, “Where are those men who said that they did not want Saul to be our
king? Bring them here, and we will kill them!” 
\p
\v 13 But Saul replied, “\add No\add*, we are not going to execute anyone today, because this is the day that Yahweh has saved
us Israeli people. \add It is a day to rejoice, not to kill anyone\add*.”
\p
\v 14 Then Samuel said to the people, “Let's all go to Gilgal, and there we will again proclaim that
\add Saul is\add* our king.” 
\v 15 So they went to Gilgal. There, knowing that Yahweh was watching, they proclaimed that Saul was their king. Then they
offered sacrifices to enable them to continue to have fellowship with Yahweh. And Saul and all the other Israeli people were
very happy.
