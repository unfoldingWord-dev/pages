\c 21  
\s David and his men hid in a cave 
\p
\v 1 David fled from there and went to Nob \add city to see\add* Ahimelech the priest. Ahimelech trembled when he saw David
\add because he was afraid that something bad had happened\add*. He said to David, “Why are you alone? Why have no men come
with you?” 
\p
\v 2 David \add deceived Ahimelech\add* by replying, “The king sent me. But he does not want anyone to know anything about what
he sent me to do. I have told my men where \add they should meet
me\add*. 
\v 3 Now \add I want to know\add*, do you have any \add food here for me to
eat\add* [IDI]? Could you give me five loaves of bread, or whatever
\add other food\add* that you can find?” 
\p
\v 4 The priest answered David, “There is no ordinary bread here, but I have some of the sacred bread
\add that was placed before Yahweh\add*. Your men may eat it if they have not slept with \\f + \\ft euphemism \\f* women
\add recently\add*.” 
\p
\v 5 David replied, “They have not been near women for many days. I do not allow my men to defile themselves by sleeping with
women while they are preparing to fight in battles. They must continue to keep themselves acceptable to God when they are on
ordinary trips, and \add today they have kept themselves acceptable to
God\add* because now we are doing something very special\f + \ft Or: important \f*.”
\v 6 The only bread that the priest had was the sacred bread that had been placed in Yahweh's presence
\add in the Sacred tent\add*. So the priest gave David some of that bread. On that day the priest had taken those loaves from
the table and replaced them with ◄fresh\f + \ft Or: newly \f* baked► loaves. 
\p
\v 7 It happened that Doeg, from the Edom people-group, was there on that day to make himself acceptable to Yahweh,
\add and he saw what Elimelech did\add*. He was one of Saul's officials and the leader of Saul's shepherds.
\p
\v 8 David asked Ahimelech, “Do you have a spear or a sword \add that I could
use\add*? The king \add appointed us to do\add* this task \add and told us to
leave\add* immediately, so I did have time to bring any weapons.”
\p
\v 9 Ahimelech replied, “I have only the sword that belonged to Goliath the
\add giant from\add* the Philistia people-group whom you killed in Elah Valley. It is wrapped in a cloth, and is behind the
sacred vest \add in the Sacred Tent\add*. If you want it, take it, because I have no other
\add weapon\add* here.” 
\p David replied, “Truly, there is no other sword that is \add as
good\add* as that one! Give it to me.” 
\v 10  \add So Ahimelech gave it to him\add*, and David left there. He
\add and his men\add* and went to Gath \add city in the Philistia
region\add*, to stay with King Achish. 
\v 11 But the officers of King Achish \add objected to David being
there\add*. They said to King Achish, “This man is \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* David, the king of Israel! He is the one \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* whom
\add our enemies\add*, the \add Israeli\add* people, \add honored
by\add* dancing and singing, 
\q ‘Saul has killed thousands \add of his enemies\add*, 
\q2 but David has killed tens of thousands of them!’ ” 
\p
\v 12 David heard what those men were saying, so he was afraid of what King Achish
\add might do to him\add*. 
\v 13 So he pretended that he was insane. He started scratching on the gates
\add of the city\add* and allowing his saliva to run down his beard.
\p
\v 14 Then King Achish said to his men, “Look at this man! He is acting like an insane man! Why have you brought him to me?
\v 15 Have you brought him because I do not have enough insane men here already \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f*? I do not want \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* him to come into my
house!”
