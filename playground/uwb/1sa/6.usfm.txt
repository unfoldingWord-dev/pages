\s They returned the sacred chest to the Israelis 
\p
\v 1 The people of Philistia kept the God's sacred chest in their area for seven months.
\v 2 Then they summoned their priests and their diviners\f + \ft Or: men who practice rituals to find out what would happen in the
future \f*. They asked them, "What should we do with the sacred chest of Yahweh? Tell us how we should send it back to its own
land." 
\p
\v 3 Those men replied, "Send with it an offering \add to show Yahweh that you know that you
are\add* guilty \add for capturing the chest\add*, in order that the plague will stop. I you do that, and then if you are
healed, you will know that he is the one who caused the plague to strike you."
\p
\v 4 The people of Philistia asked, "What kind of offering should we send?"
\p The men replied, "Make five gold models of the tumors on your skin, and five gold models of rats. Make five of each because
that will be the same number as the number of your kings, and because the plague has struck both you people and your five
kings. 
\v 5 Make models that represent the rats and the tumors that are ruining your land. Make them in order to honor the god of the
Israeli people. If you do that, perhaps he will stop punishing [IDI] you, and your gods, and your land.
\v 6 Do not be \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* stubborn [IDI] like the Egyptians and their king were.
\add They did not do what their god told them to do, so he punished
them\add*. After their god finished punishing them very severely, they were glad to allow the Israelis to leave their country
\f + \ft rhetorical question \f*. 
\p
\v 7 So you must build a new cart. Then get two cows that have very recently given birth to calves. They must be cows that have
never been hitched to a cart \f + \ft metonymy \f*. Hitch those cows to the new cart, and take the calves away from their mothers.
\v 8 Put their god's sacred chest on the cart. Also put in the cart the five gold models of the tumors on your skin and the
five gold models of rats. Put them in a small box alongside the sacred chest. They will be an offering to show that you know
that you deserved to be punished \add for capturing the sacred chest\add*. Then send the
\add cows\add* down the road, \add pulling\add* the cart. 
\v 9  \add Watch the cart as the cows pull it\add*. If they pull it to Beth-Shemesh
\add town\add* in Israel, we will know that it was their god who brought this plague on us. But if they do not take it there,
we will know that it was not the god \f + \ft metonymy \f* of the Israelis who has punished us. We will know that it just happened."
\p
\v 10 So the people did what the priests and diviners told them to do. They
\add made a cart\add*, and hitched two cows to it. They took the calves from their mothers.
\v 11 They put in the cart Yahweh's sacred chest and the box with the models of the gold rats and the tumors.
\v 12 Then the cows started walking, and they went straight toward Beth-Shemesh. They stayed on the road, and were mooing all
the time. They did not turn to the left or to the right. The five kings of the Philistia area followed the cows until they
reached the edge of Beth-Shemesh. 
\p
\v 13 At that time, the people of Beth-Shemesh were harvesting wheat in the valley
\add outside the city\add*. \add When the cows came along the road\add*, they looked up and saw the sacred chest. They were
extremely happy to see it. 
\v 14-15 The cows pulled the cart into the field of a man named Joshua, and they stopped alongside a large rock. Several men
from the tribe of Levi lifted from the cart the sacred chest and the box containing the gold models of the rats and the tumors,
and put them all on the large rock. Then the people smashed the cart and kindled a fire with the wood
\add from which the cart had been made\add*. They slaughtered the cows and burned their bodies\f + \ft Or: carcasses \f* on the fire to be an
offering for Yahweh that would be completely burned. That day the people of Beth-Shemesh offered to Yahweh
\add many\add* sacrifices that were completely burned, and \add other\add* sacrifices.
\v 16 The five kings from the Philistia area watched all this, and then they returned to Ekron, that same day.
\p
\v 17 The five gold models of tumors that they sent to be an offering to Yahweh to show that they knew that they deserved to be
punished were gifts from \add those five kings who were rulers of\add* Ashdod, Gaza, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron
\add cities\add*. 
\v 18 The models of the five gold rats were gifts from the people of those five cities and the surrounding towns. The large
rock at Beth-Shemesh, on which the \add men of the tribe of Levi\add* set the sacred chest, is still there in the field that
belonged to Joshua. When people see it, they remember \add what happened
there\add*. 
\p
\v 19 But seventy men from Beth-Shemesh looked into Yahweh's sacred chest, and because of that, Yahweh caused them to die. Then
the people mourned very much because Yahweh punished [IDI] those men like that.
\v 20 They said, "No one \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* can resist the power of\f + \ft Or: come into the presence of \f* Yahweh, our holy God,
\add and remain alive\add*! Where can we send the sacred chest?"
\p
\v 21 They sent messengers to the people of Kiriath-Jearim \add city\add* to tell them, "The people of Philistia have returned
Yahweh's sacred chest to us! Come here and take it to your \add city\add*!"
