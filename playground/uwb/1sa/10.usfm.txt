\c 10  
\s Samuel appointed Saul to be king 
\p
\v 1 Then Samuel took a small jar of olive oil and poured \add some
of\add* it on Saul's head. Then he kissed Saul \add on the cheek\add*, and told him, “I am doing this because Yahweh has chosen
you to be the leader of his Israeli people \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*. 
\v 2 When you leave me today, when you arrive near Rachel's tomb at Zelzah, in the area where the descendants of Benjamin live,
you will meet two men. They will say to you, ‘The donkeys have been found, but now your father is worrying about you, and he is
asking people, “Have you seen my son?” ’ 
\p
\v 3 When you arrive at the \add large\add* oak tree at Tabor \add town\add*, you will see three men coming toward you. They
will be on their way to \add worship\add* God at Bethel \add town\add*. One of them will be leading three young goats, one will
be carrying three loaves of bread, and one will be carrying a container of wine.
\v 4 They will greet you, and they will offer you two of the loaves of bread. Accept them.
\p
\v 5 When you arrive at the hill \add where people worship\add* God near Gibeah
\add town\add*, where there is the camp where the Philistine soldiers stay, you will meet a group of prophets who will be
coming down from the altar on top of the hill. There will be people in front of them who will be playing
\add various musical instruments:\add* a harp, a tambourine, a flute, and a lyre. And all of them will be speaking ecstatic
messages. 
\v 6 At that time the Spirit of Yahweh will come upon you, and you also will speak messages that come from God. You will be
changed\f + \ft Or: The Spirit of Yahweh will change you \f*, so that you will become like a different person.
\v 7 After those things occur, do whatever you think is right to do, and God will be with\f + \ft Or: help \f* you.
\p
\v 8 Then go ahead of me, down to Gilgal \add city\add*, and wait for me there, for seven days. Then I will join you there, to
burn sacrifices and offer other sacrifices to enable you to continue to have fellowship with God. When I arrive there, I will
tell you what \add other\add* things you should do.” 
\s What Samuel prophesied came true 
\p
\v 9 As Saul started to leave there, God changed Saul's inner being. And all the things that Samuel had predicted happened on
that day. 
\v 10 When Saul and his servant arrived at Gibeah, they saw some prophets who were
\add speaking messages that came directly from God. As the prophets
were\add* approaching Saul and his servant, God's Spirit came upon Saul powerfully, and he also began to speak messages from
God. 
\v 11 When people who had known Saul previously heard him speaking messages from God as the prophets were doing, they said to
each other, “What has happened to this son of Kish? Is he now really one of the prophets\f + \ft Or: men who speak messages from God \f*?”
\p
\v 12 One of the men who lived there replied, “◄It does not matter who the parents of these other prophets are.\f + \ft Or: All \f* prophets
receive their power to speak messages from God, not from their parents.► \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\add What matters is that, amazingly, Saul is speaking messages from
God\add*.” And that is why, \add when people are very skeptical about some report, they think about what happened to Saul,
and\add* said, “Is Saul really one of the prophets?” 
\v 13 When Saul finished speaking the messages that God gave him, he went to the place where the people offered sacrifices.
\p
\v 14 Later, Saul's uncle \add saw him there\add*, and asked him, “Where did you go?” Saul replied, “We went to look for the
donkeys. When we could not find them, we came here to ask Samuel
\add if he could tell us where they were\add*.” 
\p
\v 15 Saul's uncle replied, “What did Samuel tell you?” 
\p
\v 16 Saul replied, “He assured us that someone had found the donkeys\f + \ft Or: the donkeys had been found \f*.” But he did not tell his
uncle what Samuel had said about him becoming the king \add of Israel\add*.
\p
\v 17  \add Later\add* Samuel summoned the people of Israel to gather at Mizpah to
\add hear a message from\add* Yahweh. 
\v 18 After they arrived, he said to them, “This is what Yahweh, the God we Israeli people
\add worship\add*, says: ‘I brought you Israeli people out of Egypt. I rescued your
\add ancestors\add* from the power \f + \ft metonymy \f* of the rulers of Egypt and from all the other kings who oppressed them.
\v 19 I am the one who saves you from all your troubles and difficulties \f + \ft doublet \f*. But today you have rejected me, your God, and
you have said “We don't care! Give us a king!” So \add I will do what you
want\add*. Now have \add representatives of\add* your tribes and of your clans stand here ◄in the presence of Yahweh\f + \ft Or: as \f* Yahweh
is listening►.’ ” 
\p
\v 20 When those representatives came near to Samuel, \add God indicated
that\add* he had chosen someone from the tribe descended from Benjamin.
\v 21 Then Samuel told representatives of the tribe of Benjamin to come forward, and God indicated that
\add from that tribe\add* he had chosen someone from the family of Matri, and then God indicated that
\add from the family of Matri\add* he had chosen Saul, the son of Kish. But when they looked for Saul, they could not find him.
\v 22 So they asked Yahweh, “Where is Saul?” Yahweh replied, “He is hiding among the army equipment.”
\p
\v 23 So they quickly went there \add and found him\add*, and brought him
\add in front of all the people\add*. They could see that \add truly\add* he was a head\f + \ft Or: foot \f* taller than anyone else.
\v 24 Then Samuel said to all the people there, “This is \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* the man whom Yahweh has chosen to be your king. Among all us
Israeli people, there is no one like him!” Then all the people shouted, “We hope\f + \ft Or: desire \f* that this king will live a long time!”
\p
\v 25 Then Samuel told the people what things that the king would force them to do, and all the things the king was required to
do. He wrote all those things on a scroll, and then he put it in a place where Yahweh could see it. Then Samuel sent all the
people home. 
\p
\v 26 When Saul returned to his home in Gibeah \add town\add*, a group of men decided to continually accompany Saul. They did
that because God motivated them\f + \ft Or: put it in their minds \f* to do that.
\v 27 But some worthless men said, “◄How can this man save us \add from our
enemies\add*?\f + \ft Or: This \f* man will not be able to save us \add from our
enemies\add*.►” \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* They despised him, and refused to give him any gifts
\add to show that they would be loyal to him\add*. But Saul did not say anything
\add to rebuke them\add*.
