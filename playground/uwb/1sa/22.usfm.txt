\c 22  
\s David and his men hid in a cave at Adullam 
\p
\v 1 David \add and his men\add* left Gath and went \add east\add* to hide in a cave on a hill at Adullam
\add city\add*. Soon his \add older\add* brothers and all his other relatives came and stayed with him there.
\v 2 Then other men came there. Some were men who had caused trouble, some were men who owed money, and some were men who were
not content [IDI] \add with the government\add*. They continued to come until there were 400 men there, and David was their
leader. 
\p
\v 3 Later they left there and went \add east\add* to Mizpah \add city\add* in the Moab region. There David requested the king
of Moab, “Please allow my father and mother to live here with you until I know what God is going to do for me.”
\v 4  \add The king gave him permission\add*, so David's parents stayed with the king of Moab all the time that David and the
men who were with him were hiding \add in that area\add*. 
\p
\v 5 One day the prophet Gad told David, “Leave ◄your fortress/this area► and return to Judah.” So David and his men went to
Hereth forest \add in Judah\add*. 
\s Saul killed Ahimelech and many other priests 
\p
\v 6 One day, someone told Saul that David and his men had arrived in Judah. On that day, Saul was sitting underneath the
tamarisk tree on a hill at Gibeah \add town\add*. He was holding his spear, and was surrounded by his army officers.
\v 7 He shouted to them, “You men of the tribe of Benjamin, listen to me! Do you think that the son of Jesse will give all of
you fields and vineyards \add if he becomes your king\add*? Will he appoint all of you to become generals and captains
\add in his army\add* \f + \fk rhetorical question \f*? 
\v 8 Is that why you have all conspired against me \f + \fk rhetorical question \f*? None of you told me when my son
\add Jonathan\add* made a solemn agreement with that son of Jesse. None of you feels sorry for me. That son of Jesse was my
servant, but now my son is encouraging him to hide in order that he may ◄ambush me/attack me suddenly►, as he is doing today!”
\p
\v 9 Doeg, a man from the Edom people-group, was standing there with Saul's officers. He said to Saul, “When I was at Nob, I
saw that son of Jesse talking to Ahimelech, the priest. 
\v 10 Ahimelech asked Yahweh what David should do. Then Ahimelech gave to David some food and the sword of Goliath, the
\add giant\add* from the Philistia people-group.” 
\p
\v 11 Then Saul summoned Ahimelech and all Ahimelech's relatives who were priests at Nob. So they all came to the king.
\v 12 Saul said to Ahimelech, “You son of Ahitub, listen to me!”
\p Ahimelech answered, “Yes, sir!” 
\v 13 Saul said, “Why are you and Jesse's son conspiring to get rid of me? You gave him some bread and a sword. You requested
God to tell David what he should do. David has rebelled against me, and right now he is
\add hiding somewhere\add*, waiting \add to attack me\add*.” 
\p
\v 14 Ahimelech replied, “\add I do not understand why you are saying that,
because\add* David, your son-in-law, the captain of your bodyguards, is very loyal to you. No one is more loyal to you than
David! Everyone in your household respects him very much. 
\v 15 Furthermore, this was certainly not \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* the first time that I requested God to say what he wanted David to do. And it
is not right for you to accuse me or any of my relatives \add of trying to get rid of
you\add*, because I do not know anything about \add anyone wanting to do
that\add*.” 
\p
\v 16 The king then shouted, “Ahimelech, you and your all your relatives are going to be executed right now!”
\p
\v 17 Then he commanded his bodyguards, “Kill these priests of Yahweh, because they are allies of David, and they are
conspiring with David against me! They knew that David was trying to run away from me, but they did not tell me!”
\p But Saul's bodyguards refused to kill Yahweh's priests. 
\p
\v 18 Then the king said to Doeg, “You kill them!” So Doeg, the man from the Edom people-group, went out and struck them with
his sword. On that day he killed eighty-five men who were wearing the sacred vests
\add because they were God's priests\add*. 
\v 19 He also went and killed many people in Nob, the city where the priests lived. He killed men, women, children, babies,
cattle, donkeys, and sheep there. 
\p
\v 20 But Abiathar, Ahimelech's son, escaped. He ran away and joined David
\add and the men who were with him\add*. 
\v 21 He told David that Saul had commanded \add Doeg to\add* kill Yahweh's priests.
\v 22 Then David said to him, “That man from the Edom people-group, Doeg, was there at Nob on the day
\add that I was there\add*. I knew that he would surely tell Saul
\add what happened\add*. So it is my fault that your father and all of his family have been killed.
\v 23 You stay with me, and do not be afraid. The man who wants to kill you wants to kill me also, but you will be safe if you
stay with me.”
