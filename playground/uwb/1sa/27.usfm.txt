\c 27  
\s David stayed among the Philistia people-group 
\p
\v 1 But David thought, “Some day Saul will capture me \add if I stay around
here\add*. So the best thing that I can do is to escape and go to the Philistia area. If I do that, Saul will stop searching
for me here in Israel, and I will be safe.” 
\p
\v 2 So David and his 600 men left Israel and went to see Maoch's son Achish, who was king of Gath
\add city in the Philistia area\add*. 
\v 3 David and his men and their families started to live there in Gath, the city where king Achish lived. David's two wives
were with him—Ahinoam from Jezreel, and Nabal's widow Abigail, from Carmel.
\v 4 When someone told Saul that David had run away \add and was
living\add* in Gath, he stopped searching for David. 
\p
\v 5  \add One day\add* David said to Achish, “If you are pleased with us, give us a place in one of the small villages where
we can stay. There is no need \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* for us to stay in the city where you are the king.”
\p
\v 6  \add Achish liked what David suggested\add*. So that day Achish gave to David Ziklag
\add town\add*. As a result, Ziklag has belonged to the kings of Judah since that time.
\p
\v 7 David \add and his men\add* lived in the Philistia area for sixteen months.
\v 8  \add During that time\add*, David and his men raided the people who lived in
\add the areas\add* where the Geshur, Girzi, and Amalek people-groups lived. Those people had lived there a long time. That
area extended \add south\add* from Telam to the Shur \add Desert\add* and to
\add the border of\add* Egypt. 
\v 9 Whenever David's men attacked them, they killed all the men and women, and they took all the people's sheep and cattle and
donkeys and camels, and even their clothes. Then they would bring those things back home,
\add and David would go to talk\add* to Achish. 
\p
\v 10 Each time Achish would ask David, “Where did you go raiding today?” David
\add would lie to him\add*. Sometimes would reply that they had gone to the southern part of Judah, and sometimes he would say
that they had gone to Jerahmeel, or to the area where the Ken people-group lived.
\v 11 David's men never brought back to Gath any man or woman who was still alive. David thought, “If we
\add do not kill everyone, some of them who are still alive\add* they will go and tell Achish
\add the truth\add* about what we really did.” David did that all the time that he
\add and his men\add* lived in the Philistia area. 
\v 12 So Achish believed what David \add told him\add*, and said to himself,
“\add Because of what David has done\add*, his own people, the Israelis, must now hate him very much. So he will have to
\add stay here and\add* serve me forever.”
