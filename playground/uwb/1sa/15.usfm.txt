\s Saul's army defeated the Amalekites 
\p
\v 1  \add One day\add* Samuel said to Saul, “Yahweh sent me to appoint you to be the king of the Israeli people. So now listen
to this message from Yahweh: 
\v 2 Yahweh, \add the all-powerful ruler of\add* the armies \add of angels in
heaven\add* has declared this: ‘I am going to punish \add the descendants
of\add* Amalek for \add attacking\add* the Israeli people after the Israelis left Egypt.
\v 3 So now go \add with your army\add* and attack the Amalek people-group. Destroy them completely—destroy them and everything
that belongs to them—the men and women, their children and infants, their cattle and sheep and camels and donkeys. Do not
◄spare any of them/allow any of them to remain alive►!’ ” 
\p
\v 4 So Saul summoned the army, and they gathered at Telaim \add town\add*. There were 200,000 soldiers. 10,000 of them were
from Judah, \add and the others were from the other Israeli tribes\add*.
\v 5 Then Saul went \add with his army\add* to a town where some of the Amalek people-group lived.
\add The army prepared to attack them suddenly by\add* hiding in the valley.
\v 6 Then Saul sent this message to the Ken people-group \add who lived in that
area:\add* “You acted kindly toward all our Israeli \add ancestors\add* when they left Egypt. But we are going to kill all of
the Amalek people-group, \add because they opposed/attacked our ancestors\add*. So move away from where the Amalek people-group
live. \add If you do not move away\add*, you will be killed when they are killed.” So when the Ken people-group
\add heard that, they immediately\add* left that area. 
\p
\v 7 Then Saul's \add army\add* slaughtered the Amalek people-group, from Havilah
\add town in the east\add* to Shur \add town in the west\add*. Shur was at the border
\add between Israel and\add* Egypt. 
\v 8 Saul's army captured Agag, the king of the Amalek people-group, but they killed everyone else.
\v 9 They not only ◄spared/did not kill► Agag, but they also took the best sheep and goats and cattle. They took everything
that was good. They destroyed only the animals that they considered to be worthless.
\s Yahweh rejected Saul as king 
\p
\v 10 Then Yahweh said to Samuel, 
\v 11 “I am sorry that I appointed Saul to be your king, because he has turned away from me and has not obeyed what I commanded
him to do.” Samuel was very disturbed/upset \add when he heard that\add*, and he cried out to Yahweh all that night.
\p
\v 12 Early the next morning, Samuel got up and went to talk with Saul. But someone told Samuel, “Saul went to Camel
\add city\add*, where he has set up a monument to honor himself. Now he has left there and gone down to Gilgal.”
\p
\v 13 When Samuel arrived \add at Gilgal\add* and came to Saul, Saul said, “I wish/desire that Yahweh will bless you! I have
obeyed what Yahweh told me to do.” 
\p
\v 14 But Samuel replied, “If that is true, why is it that I hear cattle mooing and I hear sheep bleating?”
\p
\v 15 Saul replied, “The soldiers took them from the Amalek people-group. They saved the best sheep and cattle, in order to
offer them as sacrifices to Yahweh, your God. But we have completely destroyed all the others.”
\p
\v 16 Samuel said to Saul, “Stop \add talking\add*! Allow me to tell you what Yahweh said to me last night.”
\p Saul replied, “Tell me \add what he said\add*.” 
\v 17 Samuel said, “Previously you did not think that you were important. But now you have become \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* the leader of the
tribes of Israel. Yahweh appointed you to be their king. 
\v 18 And Yahweh sent you to do something \add for him\add*. He said to you, ‘Go and get rid of all those sinful people, the
Amalek people-group. Attack them and kill all of them.’ 
\v 19 So why did you not obey Yahweh \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*? Why did your men take the best animals \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*? Why did you do what Yahweh said was
evil?” \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* 
\p
\v 20 Saul replied to Samuel, “Hey, I did what Yahweh sent me to do! I brought back King Agag, but we killed everyone else!
\v 21 My men brought back only the best sheep and cattle and other things, in order to sacrifice them to Yahweh your God here
at Gilgal.” 
\p
\v 22 But Samuel replied, 
\q “Which \add do you think\add* pleases Yahweh more, animals that are completely burned
\add on the altar\add* and other sacrifices, 
\q or people obeying him \f + \fr synecdoche \f*? 
\q It is better to obey \add Yahweh\add* than \add to offer\add* sacrifices
\add to him\add*. 
\q It is better to pay attention to what he says than \add to burn\add* the fat of rams,
\add which God said should be sacrificed to him\add*. 
\q
\v 23 To rebel \add against God\add* is as sinful as doing sorcery/black magic,
\q and being stubborn is as sinful as worshiping idols. 
\q2 So, because you disobeyed what Yahweh told you to do, 
\q he has declared that you will no longer be king.” 
\s Saul asks to be forgiven 
\p
\v 24 Then Saul said to Samuel, “\add Yes\add*, I have sinned. I disobeyed what you told me to do, which is what Yahweh
commanded. I did that because I was ◄afraid of/worried about► what my men would say
\add if I did not do what they wanted\add*. So I did what they demanded.
\v 25 But now, please forgive me for having sinned. And come back with me
\add to where the people are\add* in order that I may worship Yahweh.”
\p
\v 26 But Samuel replied, “No, I will not go back with you. You have rejected/disobeyed what Yahweh commanded you to do. So he
has rejected you, \add and declared that you will no longer\add* be the king of Israel.
\add So I do not want to talk anymore with you, either\add*.” 
\p
\v 27 As Samuel turned to leave, Saul tried to stop him by grabbing the edge of Saul's robe, and it tore.
\v 28 Samuel said to him, “Today Yahweh has torn away from you the kingdom of Israel. He will appoint someone else to be king,
someone who is a better man than you are. 
\v 29 And since the one who is the glorious \add God\add* of the Israeli people does not lie, he will not change ◄his mind/what
he has said►. Humans sometimes change their minds, but God does not do that, because he is not a human.”
\p
\v 30 Then Saul \add pleaded again\add*. He said, “I know that I have sinned. But please honor me in front of the leaders of
the Israeli people and in front of all the other Israeli people by coming back
\add to them\add* with me in order that I may worship Yahweh your God.”
\v 31 So Samuel finally agreed to do that, and they went together back
\add to where the people were\add*, and Saul worshiped Yahweh there.
\s Samuel executed King Agag 
\p
\v 32 Then Samuel said, “Bring King Agag to me.” So they brought Agag to him. Agag was confidently expecting that they would
spare him/not kill him. He was thinking, “Surely I will not have to endure an agonizing death!”
\p
\v 33 But Samuel said to him, 
\q “You have killed the sons of many women with your sword, 
\q2 so now your mother will no longer have a son.” 
\m And Samuel cut Agag into pieces \add with his sword\add*, there at Gilgal, where
\add the Israelis worshiped\add* Yahweh. 
\p
\v 34 Then Samuel left there and returned to his home in Ramah, and Saul went to his home in Gibeah.
\v 35 Samuel never saw Saul again, but he was very sad about what Saul
\add had done\add*. And Yahweh was very sorry that he had appointed Saul to be the king of Israel.
