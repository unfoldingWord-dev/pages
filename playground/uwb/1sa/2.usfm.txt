\v 1 Then Hannah prayed, saying, 
\q “In my inner being I rejoice in what you, Yahweh, \add have done\add*.
\q2 I am strong \f + \fr metaphor \f* because I belong to you. 
\q I ◄laugh at/ridicule► my enemies, 
\q2 because you, Yahweh has rescued me \add from being taunted by
them\add*. 
\b
\q
\v 2 There is no one who is holy like you, Yahweh. 
\q2 There is no other god like you. 
\q2 The is no one like you, our God, who can protect us \add as though you were putting us
beneath\add* a huge rock \add where we can hide from danger\add*.
\b
\q
\v 3  \add You people who oppose God\add*, stop boasting! 
\q2 Yahweh is a God who knows \add everything\add*, 
\q and he will evaluate/judge everyone's actions. 
\q2 So don't speak so arrogantly! 
\b
\q
\v 4 Yahweh, you break the bows/weapons of mighty soldiers, 
\q2 and you give strength to those who stumble \add because they
are\add* weak. 
\q
\v 5 Many people who previously had plenty to eat, now have to work for other people to
\add earn money\add* to buy food, 
\q2 but many who were always hungry are not hungry anymore. 
\q The woman who did not have any children before, now has given birth to many/seven children,
\q2 and the woman who had many children before, now is very lonely
\add because they have all died\add*. 
\q
\v 6 Yahweh, you cause some people to die, 
\q2 and you restore some people who were almost dead. 
\q For some people, \add it seems that they will soon\add* go to where dead people go, but you cause them to become healthy
again. 
\q
\v 7 Yahweh, you cause some people to be poor and you cause some people to be rich,
\q2 you humble some people and you honor some people. 
\q
\v 8  \add Sometimes\add* you lift poor people up so that they are no longer sitting in the dust,
\q2 and you raise up needy people so that they are no longer sitting on heaps of ashes;
\q you cause them to sit next to princes; 
\q2 you cause them to sit on chairs/thrones where people who are highly honored sit.
\q Yahweh, you are the one who laid the foundations of the earth,
\q2 and you have set the whole world on those foundations. 
\q
\v 9 You will protect your loyal/faithful people \f + \fr synecdoche \f*, 
\q but you will cause the wicked to die \f + \fr euphemism \f* \add and descend\add* to the dark
\add place where the dead go\add*. 
\q2 We do not defeat \add our enemies\add* by our own strength; 
\q
\v 10 Yahweh, you will break into pieces those who oppose you. 
\q2 You will cause thunder in the sky \add to show\add* that you ◄oppose/are angry with► them.
\q Yahweh, you will judge people \add everywhere, even those who live
in\add* the most remote places on the earth. 
\q2 You will give strength to the king whom you will appoint, and give him great power
\add over his enemies\add*.” 
\p
\v 11 Then Elkanah \add and his family\add* returned to Ramah, but Samuel, the little boy, stayed to help Eli the priest serve
Yahweh. 
\s Eli's sons were wicked 
\p
\v 12 Eli's two sons, \add who were also priests\add*, were very wicked. They did not know (OR, respect/obey) Yahweh.
\v 13 While the people were boiling the meat from their sacrifices
\add in the huge pot at the temple\add*, one of Eli's sons, \add would send his servant, and he would come with a large
three-pronged fork in his hand\add*. 
\v 14 He would stick the fork into \add the meat in\add* the pot, and whatever meat fastened onto the fork, he would take
\add and give it\add* to the priest who sent him. Eli's sons did this to all the Israeli people who came to Shiloh
\add to offer sacrifices\add*. 
\v 15 Furthermore, before the fat \add on the meat was cut off\add* and burned
\add as a sacrifice to Yahweh\add*, the servant of the priest would
\add sometimes\add* come to the man who was making the sacrifice and say to him, “Give me some meat
\add now to take to\add* the priest for him to roast! He wants raw meat; he does not want boiled meat.”
\p
\v 16 If the man said to the servant, “Let the priests \add cut off
and\add* burn the fat first; then you can take what you want,” the servant would reply, “No, give it to me now; if you do not
give it to me, I will take it forcefully!” 
\p
\v 17 Yahweh considered that the young \add sons of Eli\add* were committing a very great sin, because they were treating very
disrespectfully the offerings that were being given to Yahweh. 
\p
\v 18 As for Samuel, who was still a very young boy, he continued to do work for Yahweh, wearing a little sacred linen vest
\add like the Supreme priest wore\add*. 
\v 19 Each year his mother made a \add new\add* little robe for him and took it to him when she went up
\add to Shiloh\add* with her husband to offer a sacrifice. 
\v 20 Then Eli would \add ask God to\add* bless Elkanah and his wife, and he would say to Elkanah, “I hope/desire that Yahweh
will enable your wife to give birth to other children, to take the place of the one whom she dedicated to Yahweh.” Then Elkanah
and his family would return home. 
\v 21 And Yahweh was very kind to Hannah, and enabled her to give birth to three
\add other\add* sons and two daughters. Their son Samuel grew up while he was doing work for Yahweh
\add in his temple\add*. 
\s Eli warned his sons 
\p
\v 22 Eli became very old. He often heard about all the \add evil\add* things that his sons were doing to the Israeli people.
He heard that they \add sometimes\add* ◄slept with/had sex with► the women who worked at the entrance to the tent where
\add God\add* spoke to \add his people\add*. 
\v 23 He said to them, “◄It is terrible that you do such things!/Why do you do such things?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* Many people keep telling me
about the evil things that you do. 
\v 24 My sons, stop it! The reports \add about you\add* that the people who belong to Yahweh tell others are terrible \f + \fr euphemism \f*!
\v 25 If one person sins against another person, God can ◄intercede/act as a referee► between them. But if someone sins against
Yahweh, no one can \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* ◄intercede/act as a referee► between them!” But Eli's sons would not listen to what their father said.
This was because Yahweh had decided \add that someone needed\add* to kill them.
\s A prophet warned what would happen to Eli and his family people
\p
\v 26 The boy Samuel continued to grow up, and the things that he did pleased Yahweh and the people.
\v 27 One day, a prophet came to Eli and told him, “This is what Yahweh has told me: ‘When your ancestors were slaves of the
King of Egypt, I appeared to Aaron. 
\v 28 From all the tribes of the Israeli people, I chose him \add and his male
descendants\add* to be priests for me. I appointed them to go up to my altar, to burn incense, to wear a sacred apron
\add as they worked\add* for me. And I declared that they could take
\add and eat some of the meat\add* that the Israeli people burned
\add on the altar\add*. 
\v 29 So why do you show disrespect for the sacrifices and offerings that I commanded
\add the people to bring\add* to me \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*? You are honoring your sons more than you are honoring me, by allowing them to get
fat from eating the best parts of all the sacrifices that the Israeli people bring to me!’
\p
\v 30 Therefore, this is what Yahweh, the God whom we Israelis \add worship\add*, declares: ‘I definitely promised that Aaron
and his descendants would continue to serve \f + \fr idiom \f* me forever. But now I declare this: it will not continue like that! I will
honor those who honor me, but I will despise those who despise me.
\v 31 Listen carefully! There will soon be a time when I will cause all the strong
\add young men\add* in your family to die. The result will be that no men in your family will
\add live long enough to\add* become old men. 
\v 32 You will be distressed and envious as you see the blessings that I will give to the
\add other people in\add* Israel. And \add I repeat that\add* no men in your family will ever live long enough to become old
men. 
\v 33 There is one of your descendants whom I will spare, and not prevent him from serving me as a priest. But he will become
blind, and then he will always be sad and grieving. But all your other descendants will die violently.
\v 34 And your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, will both die on the same day. And that will prove to you
\add that all that I have said will come true/happen\add*. 
\p
\v 35 I have chosen another man to be my priest. He is one who will serve me faithfully: he will do everything I want \f + \fr doublet \f* him
to do. And I will enable him to have many descendants \f + \fr idiom \f* who will be priests and always serve me by helping the king whom I
will choose. 
\v 36 All of your descendants who remain alive will have to go to that priest and ask him to give them money and food, and they
will each have to say, “Please allow me to help the other priests, in order that I may
\add earn some money to\add* buy some food.” ’ ”
