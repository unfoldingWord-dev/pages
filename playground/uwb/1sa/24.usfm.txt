\c 24  
\s David spared Saul's life 
\p
\v 1 After Saul \add and his soldiers\add* returned \add home\add* after fighting against the Philistia army, someone reported
to Saul that David \add and his men\add* had gone into the desert near En-Gedi.
\v 2 When Saul \add heard that\add*, he chose 3,000 men from various areas in Israel, and they went to search for David and his
men at a place named Rocks of Wild Goats. 
\p
\v 3 At a place where the road was alongside some sheep pens, Saul
\add left the road and\add* entered a cave to defecate \f + \ft euphemism \f*. \add He did not know
that\add* David and his men were hiding further inside that same cave!
\v 4 David's men \add saw Saul and\add* whispered to David, “Today is the day that Yahweh spoke about when he said, ‘I will
enable you to defeat your enemy.’ You can do to him whatever you want to!” So David crept toward the entrance of the cave and
cut off \add with his knife\add* a piece of Saul's robe. 
\v 5  \add And then he returned to his men\add*. 
\p But then David felt guilty for having cut off a piece of Saul's robe.
\v 6 He said to his men, “I should not have done that to the king! I hope\f + \ft Or: desire \f* that Yahweh will never allow me to attack the
one whom God has appointed, because Yahweh is the one who chose him
\add to be the king\add*.” 
\v 7 By saying that, David restrained his men, and did not allow them to kill Saul.
\p
\v 8 After Saul left the cave and started to walk on the road again, David came out of the cave and shouted to Saul, “King
Saul!” Saul turned around and looked, and David bowed down with his face touching the ground.
\v 9 Then he said to Saul, “◄Why do you pay attention to people when they say ‘David wants to harm you’?\f + \ft Or: You \f* should not pay
attention to people when they say ‘David wants to harm you’.► \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 10 Today you can see with your own eyes that \add what they say is not
true\add*. Yahweh put you in a place where I and my men could have killed you when you were in this cave. Some of my men told
me that I should do that, but I did not allow them to do that. I said to them, ‘I will not harm my master, because he is the
king whom Yahweh appointed.’ 
\v 11 Your majesty, look at this piece of your robe that is in my hand! I cut it from your robe, but I did not kill you. So now
you should be able to understand that I am not planning to do anything evil to you. I have not done anything wrong to you, but
you are searching for me to kill me. 
\v 12 I hope\f + \ft Or: desire \f* that Yahweh will judge and decide which of us
\add is doing what is right\f + \ft Or: pleases him\add* \f*. And I hope, Or: desire that he will punish you for the wrong things that you have
done to me. But I will not try to harm you. 
\v 13 There is a proverb that has the words, ‘Evil things are done by evil people.’ But
\add I am not evil\add*, so I will not do evil things to you. 
\p
\v 14 You are the king of Israel. So why are you pursuing me?\f + \ft Or: you should not be pursuing me. \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* I am
\add as harmless as\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* a dead dog or a flea. 
\v 15 I hope\f + \ft Or: desire \f* that Yahweh will judge which of us \add is doing what ◄he wants\f + \ft Or: is \f*
right►\add*. I trust that he will \add act like a lawyer and\add* judge my case\f + \ft Or: what I have done \f*, and that he will rescue me
from your power \f + \ft metonymy \f*.” 
\p
\v 16 When David finished saying that to Saul, Saul \add called out to him
and\add* asked, “My son David, is that your voice \add that I am
hearing\add*?” Then he cried loudly. 
\v 17 He said, “You are a better man than I am. You have done something very good to me when I tried to do something very bad
to you. 
\v 18 When Yahweh put me in a place \add in that cave\add* where you could have easily killed me, you did not do that.
\v 19 Who else would\f + \ft Or: No one else would \f* find his enemy and allow his enemy to escape
\add when he could kill him instead\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*. I hope\f + \ft Or: desire \f* that Yahweh will reward you for your acting kindly toward me
today. 
\v 20 I know that \add some day\add* you will surely become the king, and that your kingdom will prosper as you rule the
Israeli people. 
\v 21 Now while Yahweh is listening, solemnly promise to me that you will not kill my family and get rid of all my
descendants.” 
\p
\v 22 David solemnly promised Saul that he would do \add not harm Saul's
family\add*. Then Saul went back home, and David and his men went back up into the place where they had been hiding.
