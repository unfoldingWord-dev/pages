\c 20  
\s Jonathan helped David escape from Saul 
\p
\v 1 David ran away from the Naioth \add section\add* of Ramah \add city\add*. He went to Jonathan and asked him, "What have I
done \add to displease your father\add*? What did I do that was wrong? Why is he trying to kill me?"
\p
\v 2 Jonathan replied, "My father is surely not trying to kill you! He always tells me before he does anything that he is
planning. He tells me about important things and unimportant things that he plans to do. Why would he refuse to tell me
\add if he were planning to kill me\add*?\f + \ft Or: I am sure that he would not refuse to tell me
\add if he were planning to kill me\add*. \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* So what you are saying cannot be true."
\p
\v 3 Then David solemnly declared this to Jonathan: "Your father knows very well that you and I are very good friends, so he
says to himself, 'I will not tell Jonathan \add what I am going to
do\add*. If I tell Jonathan, he will be upset\f + \ft Or: distressed \f*, \add and then he will tell
David\add*.' But just as certain as Yahweh lives and you live, I am only one step away from being killed."
\p
\v 4 Jonathan said to David, "I will do whatever you tell me to do."
\p
\v 5 David replied, "Tomorrow we will celebrate the festival of the new moon. I always eat with the king at that festival. But
tomorrow I will hide in the field, and I will stay there for one night. I will stay there until the evening of the day after
tomorrow. 
\v 6 If your father asks why I am not there at the festival, say to him, 'David requested me to allow him to go to his home in
Bethlehem, where his family will offer the sacrifice that they offer every year.'
\v 7 If your father says 'That is okay', then I know I will be safe. But if he becomes extremely angry, you will know that he
is determined to harm me. 
\v 8 Please be kind to me. Yahweh heard you when you made a solemn agreement with me
\add that you and I will always be good friends\add*. If I deserve to be punished \f + \ft metonymy \f*, kill me yourself. I do not want \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
you to allow your father to punish [IDI] me." 
\p
\v 9 Jonathan replied, "I will never do that! But if I find out that my father is determined to harm\f + \ft Or: kill \f* you, I will certainly
warn you." \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* 
\p
\v 10 David asked him, "How will I find out if your father answers you harshly?"
\v 11 Jonathan replied, "Come with me. We will go out into the field." So they went together out into the field.
\p
\v 12 There Jonathan said to David, "I promise this while Yahweh, the God whom we Israelis
\add worship\add*, is listening: at this time the day after tomorrow, I will find out what my father
\add is thinking about you\add*. If he is saying good things about you, I will certainly send a message to you to tell that to
you \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*. 
\v 13 But if he is planning to hurt\f + \ft Or: kill \f* you, I will enable you to know [IDI] that, and enable you to go away safely. I desire
that Yahweh will punish me severely if I do not do that \add for
you\add*. I desire\f + \ft Or: hope \f* that Yahweh will be with you \add and help
you\add* like he has helped my father. 
\v 14 But while I am still alive, please act kindly toward me in the same way that Yahweh acts kindly toward me, and do not
kill me \add when you become king\add*. 
\v 15 But \add if I die\add*, never stop acting kindly toward my family,
\add even\add* after Yahweh has gotten rid of all your enemies all over the earth."
\p
\v 16 So Jonathan made a solemn agreement with David. And he said, "I hope\f + \ft Or: desire \f* that Yahweh will get rid of all your
enemies." 
\v 17 And Jonathan requested David to repeat his solemn promise to be his close friend, because Jonathan loved David as much as
he loved himself. 
\p
\v 18 Then Jonathan said, "Tomorrow we will celebrate the festival of the new moon. When you are not sitting at your place when
we eat, my father will miss you\f + \ft Or: see that you are not there \f*. 
\v 19 The day after tomorrow, in the evening go to the place where you hid before. Wait by the pile of stones.
\v 20 I will come out and shoot three arrows as though I were trying to shoot at a target.
\add The arrows will hit the ground\add* close to the pile of stones.
\v 21 Then I will send a boy to bring the arrows back to me. If you hear me say to him, 'They are closer to me', then as surely
as Yahweh lives, you will know that everything is fine, \add and that you will not be
killed\add*. 
\v 22 But if I tell him, 'The arrows are farther away', you will know that you must leave immediately, because Yahweh wants you
to run away. 
\v 23 I hope\f + \ft Or: desire \f* that Yahweh will watch you and me and enable us to never forget what we have promised each other."
\p
\v 24 So David went and hid in the field. When the festival of the new moon started, the king sat down to eat.
\v 25 He sat where he usually sat, close to the wall. Jonathan sat across from him, and Abner
\add the army commander\add* sat next to Saul. But no one was sitting in the place where David
\add usually sat\add*. 
\v 26 On that day, Saul did not say anything about David, because he was thinking, "Something must have happened that caused
David to become unacceptable \add to worship God\add*." 
\v 27 But the next day, when David was not sitting at the place the place where he usually sat, Saul asked Jonathan, "Why has
that son of Jesse not been here to eat with us yesterday and today?"
\p
\v 28 Jonathan replied, "David earnestly requested me that I permit him to go to Bethlehem.
\v 29 He said, 'Please allow me to go, because our family is going to offer a sacrifice. My
\add older\add* brother insisted that I be there. So please allow me to go to be with my
\add older\add* brothers.' \add I allowed David to go\add*, and that is the reason that he is not here eating with you."
\p
\v 30 Saul was furious\f + \ft Or: very angry \f* with Jonathan. He yelled at him, "You stupid bastard \f + \ft euphemism \f*! I know that you are being loyal
to that son of Jesse. By doing that, you will cause shame to come to yourself and to your mother.
\v 31 As long as Jesse's son is living, you will never become the king, and you will never rule over a kingdom! So now, summon
David, and bring him to me. He must be executed!" 
\p
\v 32 Jonathan asked his father, "Why should David be executed? What wrong has he done?"
\v 33 Then Saul threw his spear at Jonathan in order to kill him,
\add but the spear did not hit him\add*. So Jonathan knew that his father really wanted to kill David.
\p
\v 34 Jonathan was very angry, and he left the room. On that second day of the festival he refused to eat anything. He was
disgusted about what his father had done, and he was worried about David.
\p
\v 35 The following morning Jonathan went out to the field to give a message to David, like he had agreed that he would do. He
took a young boy with him. 
\v 36 Jonathan said to the boy, "Run and find the arrows that I shoot." The boy started running, and Jonathan shot an arrow
ahead of the boy. 
\v 37 The boy ran to the place where the arrow hit the ground, but Jonathan called out, "The arrow is further away!" \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 38 Then he shouted to the boy, "Go quickly; do not wait! Do not stop!" The boy picked up the arrow and brought it back to
Jonathan. 
\v 39 But the boy did not understand the meaning of what Jonathan had said; only Jonathan and David knew.
\v 40 Then Jonathan gave his bow and arrows to the boy and told him, "Go back to the town."
\p
\v 41 When the boy left, David came out from the south side of the pile of stones behind which he had been hiding. He went to
Jonathan and bowed \add in front of Jonathan\add* three times, with his face touching the ground. Then David and Jonathan
kissed each other \add on the cheek\f + \ft Or: neck \f*\add*, and they cried together. But David cried more than Jonathan.
\p
\v 42 Jonathan said to David, "May things go well for you as you go. Yahweh has heard what we solemnly promised to always do
for each other, and what we said that our descendants must do for each other." Then David left, and Jonathan went back to the
town.
