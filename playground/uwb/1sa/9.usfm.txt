\c 9  
\s Saul met Samuel 
\p
\v 1 There was a rich and influential man whose name was Kish. He belonged to the tribe descended from Benjamin. Kish was the
son of Abiel and the grandson of Zeror. He was from the family of Becorath and from the clan of Aphiah.
\v 2 Kish had a son whose name was Saul. He was more handsome than any of the other Israeli men, and he was a head\f + \ft Or: foot \f* taller
than any of the other Israeli men. 
\p
\v 3 One day, some of Kish's female donkeys wandered off. So Kish told Saul, “Take one of my servants with you, and go and
search for the donkeys!” 
\v 4 So Saul did that. He took a servant, and they walked through the hilly area where the descendants of Ephraim lived, and
then they went through the areas named Shalishah and Shaalim, and then they went through all the area where the descendants of
Benjamin lived, but they could not find the donkeys. 
\p
\v 5 Finally, they came to the area of Zuph. Then Saul said to the servant, “Let's go back home. If we do not do that, my
father will stop worrying about the donkeys and start worrying about us.”
\p
\v 6 But the servant said, “I have another idea [IDI]. There is one of God's prophets who lives in this town. People respect
him very much, because everything he predicts comes true. Let's go
\add and talk\add* to him. Perhaps he can tell us where we can go
\add to find the donkeys\add*.” 
\p
\v 7 Saul replied to the servant, “If we go to talk with him, \add we should give a gift to
him\add*, but what can we give to him? We have no more food in our sacks. Do we have anything else to give to him?”
\p
\v 8 The servant replied, “Look \add at this\add*! I have a small silver coin. I can give this to him, and then he will tell us
where to go \add to find the donkeys\add*.” 
\v 9-11 Saul said, “Okay, let's go \add talk to him.”\add* So they went to the town where the prophet lived. As they were going
up the hill into the town, they met some young women who were coming out of the town to get some water
\add from a well\add*. One of them asked the women, “Is the seer in the town
\add today\add*?” \add They said that because\add* previously, if people
\add in Israel\add* wanted a message from God, they would say, “Let's go to the seer,” and people who now are called prophets
were at that time called ‘those who see \add ◄visions from God\f + \ft Or: all \f* that God
sees►\add*.’ 
\v 12 The women replied, “Yes, he is in the town. In fact, he is
\add walking on the road\add* ahead of you. He arrived in the town today because the people are going to offer a sacrifice on
the altar where the people gather \add to worship God\add*. 
\v 13 If you go quickly, you will \add have time to talk to him\add* before he goes there. The people who have been invited
will not start eating until he arrives there and ◄blesses\f + \ft Or: asks \f* God to bless► the sacrifice.”
\p
\v 14 So Saul and the servant entered the town. As they went through the gates, they saw Samuel as he was coming toward them,
on the way to where people were going to offer sacrifices. 
\p
\v 15 On the previous day, Yahweh had told Samuel, 
\v 16 “At this time tomorrow, I will send to you a man from the land where the descendants of Benjamin live. Pour olive oil
\add on his head to indicate that he will\add* be the leader of my Israeli people. I have seen that my people are suffering
\add because the Philistine people are oppressing them\add*, and I have heard my people as they have called out to me
\add for help\add*. The man whom you anoint will rescue my people from the power \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* of the Philistine people.”
\p
\v 17 When Samuel saw Saul, Yahweh said to him, “This is the man I told you about yesterday! He is the one who will rule my
people!” 
\p
\v 18 Saul saw Samuel as he was sitting at the town gates \add but he did not know that it was
Samuel\add*. He went over to him and asked him, “Can you tell me, where is the house of the man who sees
\add ◄visions from God\f + \ft Or: all \f* that God sees►\add*?” 
\p
\v 19 Samuel replied, “I am that man. Go ahead of me with your servant to the place where the people make sacrifices. Both of
you will eat with me today. Tomorrow morning I will tell you what you are wanting to know, and then I will send you home.
\v 20 Also, do not worry anymore about those donkeys that wandered away three days ago. ◄Someone has found them\f + \ft Or: They \f* have been
found►. But \add what you need to know is that\add* it is you and your family that all the Israeli people are wanting!” \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f*
\p
\v 21 Saul replied, “I am from the tribe of Benjamin \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f*. That is the smallest tribe in Israel \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f*! And my family is the
least important family in our tribe! So why are you talking to me like this,
\add about the Israeli people wanting me and my family\add*?” 
\p
\v 22 Then Samuel brought Saul and the servant into the big dining room, and told them to sit at the head
\add of the table, indicating that he was\add* honoring them more than he was honoring the thirty people who had been invited.
\v 23 Then Samuel told the cook, “Bring to me the special piece \add of
meat\add* that I told you to set aside.” 
\p
\v 24 So the cook brought the leg and the meat that was on it, and set it in front of Saul,
\add even though those portions were for only the priest to eat\add*. Samuel said to Saul, “Start eating it. I told the cook to
save this for you, so that you could eat it at this time, when all these people whom I invited are here.” So Saul and Samuel
ate together. 
\p
\v 25 After they finished eating, they returned to the town. Then Samuel took Saul up to the
\add flat\add* roof of his house, and fixed a bed for him. 
\p
\v 26 As the sun was rising the next morning, Samuel called up to Saul, “Get up! It is time for me to send you on the road back
home.” So Samuel got up, and \add later\add* Samuel and Saul left the house together.
\p
\v 27 When they got to the edge of the town, Samuel told Saul to send his servant ahead. After the servant left, Samuel said to
Saul, “Stay here for a few minutes, in order that I can give you a message I received from God.”
