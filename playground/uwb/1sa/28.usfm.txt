\c 28  
\s Saul consulted a witch\f + \ft Or: medium \f* 
\p
\v 1 Some time later, the people of Philistia gathered their army to attack the Israelis
\add again\add*. King Achish told David, “I am expecting that you and your men will join with my men to attack
\add the Israelis\add*.” 
\p
\v 2 David replied, “\add We will go with you, and then\add* you will see for yourself what we can do!”
\p Achish said, “Okay, I will appoint you to be my bodyguard permanently.”
\p
\v 3  \add While Samuel was still alive, Saul did many things that pleased Yahweh. One of the good things that Saul did
was\add* to expel from Israel all the people who were fortune-tellers or who talked to the spirits of dead people. But Samuel
had died, and all the Israeli people had mourned for him. Then they had buried him in Ramah, his hometown.
\add After that, Saul did not try to please Yahweh anymore\add*.
\p
\v 4 The army of Philistia gathered and set up their tents at Shunem
\add city, in the north of Israel\add*. Saul gathered the Israeli army and set up their tents at Gilboa
\add in the eastern part of the same valley\add*. 
\v 5 When Saul saw the army of Philistia, he became so afraid that his heart pounded\f + \ft Or: shook \f*.
\v 6 He prayed to Yahweh, but Yahweh did not answer him. Yahweh did not
\add tell Saul what he should do\add* by giving him a dream, or by
\add having the priest throw\add* the marked stones \add in his sacred
vest\add*, or by \add giving a message about Saul to\add* any prophet.
\v 7 Then Saul said to his servants, “Find for me a woman who talks to the spirits of dead people, in order that I can ask her
\add what will happen\add*.” His servants replied, “There is a woman in Endor
\add town\add* who does that.” 
\p
\v 8 So Saul \add took off the clothes that showed that he was the king,
and\add* he put on ordinary clothes ◄to disguise himself\f + \ft Or: so \f* that people would not recognize who he was►. Then he and two of his
men went during the night to talk to that woman. Saul said to her, “I want you to talk to a spirit
\add of someone who has died\add*. Cause to appear the person whose name I will
\add give to you\add*.” 
\p
\v 9 But the woman replied, “You surely know what Saul has done. He expelled from this land all the people who talk to spirits
of dead people and all fortune-tellers. I think that you are trying to trap me, in order that I will be executed
\add for doing something that is not permitted\add*.” 
\p
\v 10 Saul replied, solemnly asking Yahweh to listen to what he was saying, “Just as surely as Yahweh lives, you will not be
punished for doing this.” 
\p
\v 11 Then the woman said, “Whom do you want me to cause to appear?”
\p Saul replied, “Cause Samuel to appear.” 
\p
\v 12  \add So the woman did that\add*. But when she saw Samuel, she screamed. She said, “You have tricked me \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f*! You are
Saul! \add You will execute me for doing this\add*!” 
\p
\v 13 Saul said to her, “Do not be afraid. What do you see?” 
\p The woman said, “I see a god\f + \ft Or: spirit \f* coming up out of the ground.”
\v 14 Saul said, “What does he look like?” 
\p The woman replied, “An old man wearing a robe is appearing.” 
\p Then Saul knew that it was Samuel. So he bowed down with his face touching the ground.
\v 15 Samuel said to Saul, “Why have you bothered\f + \ft Or: disturbed \f* me by causing me to appear?”
\p Saul said, “I am very worried. The army of Philistia is about to attack my army, and God has abandoned me. He does not
answer my questions anymore. He does not give me dreams \add to tell me what to
do\add* or give messages to prophets \add to tell me what to do\add*. That is the reason that I came to see you. So you tell me
what I should do!” 
\v 16 Samuel said, “Yahweh has abandoned you and has become your enemy. So ◄why do you ask me
\add what you should do\add*?\f + \ft Or: do \f* not ask me \add what you should
do\add*.► \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* 
\v 17 He has done what he told me \add previously\add* that he would do to you. He has torn the kingdom away from you, and he
is giving it to someone who is another Israeli—David. 
\v 18 You did not obey Yahweh. Yahweh was very angry with the Amalek people-group. You did not
\add kill all of their animals\add*, with the result that you did not show that he was very angry with them. That is the reason
that he ◄\add is refusing to answer you\f + \ft Or: has \f* abandoned you\add*► today.
\v 19 Yahweh will enable the Philistia army to defeat you and all the other Israeli soldiers. And tomorrow you and your sons
will be with me \add in the place where spirits of dead people are\add*. Yahweh will cause the whole Israeli army to be
defeated by the Philistia army.” \add And after Samuel said that, he
disappeared\add*. 
\p
\v 20 Saul immediately fell flat on the ground. He was so afraid because of what Samuel had said that he became paralyzed. He
was also very weak because he had not eaten anything all that day and night.
\p
\v 21 The woman saw that he was extremely worried\f + \ft Or: terrified \f*. She said to him, “Listen to me! I have done what you requested me
to do. I could be executed for doing that. 
\v 22 So now please pay attention to what I say. Allow me to give you some food, in order that you will
\add eat it and\add* get enough strength to go back \add to your
army\add*.” 
\p
\v 23 But Saul refused. He said, “No, I will not eat anything.” Then Saul's servants also urged him
\add to eat something\add*, and finally he heeded what they said. He got up from the ground and sat on the bed.
\p
\v 24 The woman had a fat calf close to her house. She quickly slaughtered it
\add and cooked it\add*. She took some flour and mixed it \add with olive
oil\add*, and baked it without putting in any yeast. 
\v 25 She placed the food in front of Saul and his servants, and they ate some of it. Then that same night they got up and
left.
