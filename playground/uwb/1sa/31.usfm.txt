\s Saul and his sons died in a battle 
\p
\v 1 Later, the Philistines again fought against the Israelis. The Israelis ran away from them, and ◄many Israelis were
killed\f + \ft Or: the \f* Philistines killed many Israelis► on Gilboa Mountain.
\v 2 The Philistines caught up with Saul and his three sons, and they killed
\add all three of\add* his sons, Jonathan and Abinadab and Malchishua.
\v 3 The fighting was very fierce around Saul. When the Philistine ◄archers\f + \ft Or: men \f* with bows and arrows► caught up with Saul, they
wounded him badly \add with their arrows\add*. 
\p
\v 4 Saul said to the man who was carrying his weapons, “Take out your sword and kill me with it, in order that these heathen
Philistines wlll not be able to thrust their swords into me and make fun of me
\add while I am dying\add*.” 
\p But the man who was carrying Saul's weapons was terrified, and refused to do that. So Saul took his own sword and fell on
it. \add The sword pierced his body and he died\add*. 
\v 5 When the man carrying his weapons saw that Saul was dead, he also threw himself on his own sword and died.
\v 6 So Saul, three of his sons, and the man who carried Saul's weapons, all died on that same day.
\p
\v 7 When the Israeli people on the \add north side of the Jezreel\add* Valley and on the east side of the Jordan
\add River\add* heard that the Israeli army had run away and that Saul and his sons had died, they left their towns and ran
away. Then the Philistines came and occupied their towns. 
\p
\v 8 The next day, when the Philistines came to take away the weapons of the dead
\add Israeli soldiers\add*, they found the bodies of Saul and his three sons on Gilboa Mountain.
\v 9 They cut off Saul's head and took his weapons. Then they sent messengers throughout their land, to proclaim the news, in
the temple where they kept their idols, and to the other people,
\add that their army had defeated the Israelis\add*. 
\v 10 They put Saul's weapons in the temple of \add their goddess\add* Astarte. They also fastened the bodies of Saul
\add and his sons\add* to the wall \add that surrounded\add* Beth-Shan
\add city\add*. 
\p
\v 11 When the people who lived in Jabesh in the Gilead \add region\add* heard what the Philistines had done to Saul's corpse,
\v 12 all their bravest soldiers walked all night to Beth-Shan. They took the corpses of Saul and his sons down from the city
wall, and they took them back to Jabesh and burned the corpses there.
\v 13 They took the bones and buried them under a \add big\add* tamarisk tree. Then they ◄fasted\f + \ft Or: abstained \f* from eating food►
for seven days.
