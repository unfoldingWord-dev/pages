\c 1  
\s Samuel was born 
\p
\v 1 There was a man named Elkanah who lived in Ramah \add town\add* in the hilly area where
\add the members of the tribe of\add* Ephraim lived. His father was Jeroham, his grandfather was Elihu, and his
great-grandfather was Tohu. He belonged to the Zuph clan. 
\v 2 He had two wives: Hannah and Peninnah. Peninnah had several children, but Hannah had no children.
\p
\v 3 Once every year Elkanah went up \add with his family\add* from Ramah to Shiloh
\add city\add*. He went there to worship Yahweh, \add the all-powerful ruler
of\add* the armies \add of angels in heaven\add*, and offer sacrifices to him. The two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas,
\add helped their father to do the work as\add* priests of Yahweh there.
\v 4 Each time Elkanah offered sacrifices there, he gave some of the meat to Peninnah and some to each of her sons and
daughters. 
\v 5 But he gave a special (OR, double) amount of meat to Hannah because he loved her very much, even though Yahweh had not
permitted her to give birth to any children. 
\v 6 And his other wife, Peninnah, would ridicule Hannah to make her feel miserable, because Yahweh had not allowed her to bear
children. 
\v 7 This happened every year. When they went up to the temple of Yahweh
\add at Shiloh\add*, Peninnah ridiculed Hannah so much that Hannah cried and would not eat.
\v 8 Then Elkanah would say to her, “Hannah, ◄why are you crying?/please quit crying!► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* ◄Why are you not eating?/Please
eat something!► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* Why are you so upset/sad? You have me; is that not more important to you than if you had ten sons? (OR, I
\add love you\add* more than your sons \add would love you\add*, even if you had ten sons.)”
\p
\v 9 One year, after they had finished eating and drinking at Shiloh, Hannah stood up
\add to pray\add*. Eli the priest was nearby, sitting on a chair by the doorway of the sacred tent of Yahweh.
\v 10 Hannah was very distressed, and she cried very sorrowfully as she prayed to Yahweh.
\v 11 She made a solemn promise, saying, “O Almighty Commander of the armies of angels, if you will look at me and see how I
miserable I am, and think about me and allow me to give birth to a son, then I will dedicate him to you for the rest of his
life. And \add to show that he is dedicated to you\add*, ◄no one will ever
\add be allowed to\add* cut his hair/his hair will never be cut►.”
\p
\v 12 As she was praying like that to Yahweh, Eli the priest saw Hannah's lips
\add moving as she was praying\add*. 
\v 13 But Hannah was only praying silently; she was not making any sound. So Eli thought that she was drunk.
\v 14 He said to her, “How long will you continue to get drunk \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*? ◄Throw away your wine/Quit drinking wine►!”
\p
\v 15 Hannah replied, “Sir, I am not drunk! I have not been drinking wine or any other alcoholic drink. I feel very miserable
and I have been telling Yahweh about how I feel. 
\v 16 Do not think that I am a worthless/wicked woman! I have been praying like this because I am very miserable. \f + \fr doublet \f*”
\p
\v 17 Eli replied, “I wish/desire that things will go well for you. I desire that God, the one we Israeli people
\add worship\add*, will give you what you requested from him.” 
\p
\v 18 She replied, “I want you to think highly/well about me.” Then she returned
\add to her family\add* and after she ate something, her face no longer was sad.
\p
\v 19 Early the next morning, Elkanah and his family got up and worshiped Yahweh
\add again\add*, and then they returned to their home at Ramah. Elkanah ◄slept with/had sex with► Hannah. Then Yahweh answered
her prayer, 
\v 20 and she became pregnant and gave birth to a son. She named him Samuel,
\add which sounds like the words in the Hebrew language that mean ‘heard by
God’\add*, because she said “Yahweh \add heard me when\add* I requested from him
\add a son\add*.” 
\s Hannah dedicated Samuel to Yahweh 
\p
\v 21 The following year, Elkanah went up \add to Shiloh\add* with his family to make the kind of sacrifice he made each year,
and also to give a special offering to God that he had promised \add to give him
previously\add*. 
\v 22 But Hannah did not go \add with them\add*. She said to her husband, “After I have weaned the baby, I will take him
\add to Shiloh and present him\add* to Yahweh, and he will stay there for the rest of his life.”
\p
\v 23 Elkanah said, “Do what seems the best to you. Stay here until you have weaned him. What I desire is that Yahweh will
\add enable you to\add* do what you have promised.” So Hannah stayed at home and nursed her son until she weaned him.
\p
\v 24 After she weaned him, even though Samuel was very young, she took him to the temple/house of Yahweh at Shiloh.
\add To offer as a sacrifice\add*, she took along a three-year old bull,
\add a sack containing\add* ◄20 pounds/9 kg.► of flour, and a container of wine.
\v 25 After Hannah and Elkanah had slaughtered the bull \add and offered it to Yahweh on the
altar\add*, they brought the boy to Eli. 
\v 26 Then Hannah said to him, “Sir, ◄Do you remember me?/I solemnly affirm►, I am the woman who prayed as I stood here beside
you \add several years ago\add*. 
\v 27 I prayed that Yahweh would enable me to give birth to a child, and
\add this is the child\add* whom I requested Yahweh to give me. 
\v 28 So now I am presenting him to Yahweh. He will belong to Yahweh as long as he lives.” Then Elkanah
\add and his family\add* worshiped Yahweh there.
