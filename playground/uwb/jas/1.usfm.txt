\v 1  \add I\add*, James, am a servant of God and the Lord Jesus Christ.
\add I am writing this letter\add* to \add all\add* the Jewish people
\add who trust in Christ\add* \f + \ft Or: to all God's people) who are scattered throughout the world.
\add I send my\add* greetings to \add you all\add*. 
\s James 1:2-4 
\s When you experience difficulties that test whether or not you will continue to trust God, rejoice greatly and keep on
bravely enduring them in order that you may become all that God intends you to be.
\p
\v 2 My fellow believers, rejoice greatly, \add even\add* when you experience various kinds of difficulties\f + \ft Or: troubles \f*.
\v 3  \add God sometimes allows you to experience difficulties in order
to\add* test whether or not you will continue to trust \add him. Whenever that happens, you need
to\add* realize more and more that \add if you continue to trust
him\add*, you will be able to bravely\f + \ft Or: patiently \f* endure difficulties.
\v 4 Keep on enduring difficulties \add bravely\f + \ft Or: patiently \f* by trusting God more and more
firmly\add* \f + \ft personification \f*, in order that you may become all that he intends you to be \f + \ft doublet \f* (OR,
\add spiritually\add* mature and complete), not lacking ◄any \add good quality\f + \ft Or: anything \f* you need to conduct your lives as God
wants you to\add*►. 
\s James 1:5-8 
\s If you want to have wisdom to know what to do when difficulties come, ask God to help you, and firmly trust him.
\p
\v 5 If anyone of you does not know how to act wisely \add in order to endure difficulties\f + \ft Or: trials \f*
well\add*, he should ask God \add to show him what he should do,
because\add* God wholeheartedly\f + \ft Or: gladly \f* helps all people \add who
ask\add* and does not scold \add anyone for asking. Those who ask\add*, God will give them wisdom to know
\add what they should do\add*. 
\v 6 But \add when you\add* ask \add God\add*, you should firmly trust him. You should not doubt
\add that he wants to help you always\add*, because people who keep doubting God are
\add unstable\f + \ft Or: changeable \f*\add* \f + \ft simile \f* like a wave of the sea that is blown back and forth by the wind {that goes back and forth
when the wind blows} [DOU, SIM]. 
\v 7 Indeed, people \add who doubt\add* should not think that the Lord
\add God\add* will do anything \add that they request him to do\add*,
\v 8  \add because they are\add* people who cannot decide \add whether they will commit themselves to God, and they
are\add* unstable\f + \ft Or: undecided \f* in all that they do. 
\s James 1:9-11 
\s Believers who are poor and those who are rich should both value highly what God has done for them, rather than focusing on
their material resources that will disappear. 
\p
\v 9 Believers who are poor should be happy \add that God\add* considers them very valuable (OR, has exalted them
\add spiritually\add*) \f + \ft metonymy \f*. 
\v 10 And \add believers\add* who are rich should be happy \add that\add* they have humbled themselves
\add in order to trust in Jesus Christ\add* (OR, but rich people
\add can only\add* take pride \add in the fact that God\add* will humble them
\add when he judges everyone\add* \f + \ft irony \f*), because they \add and their
riches\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* will pass away, just like wild flowers \add wither\add* \f + \ft simile \f*.
\v 11 When the sun rises, the scorching hot wind dries plants, and their flowers fall and are no longer beautiful. Similarly,
rich people will die \f + \ft metaphor \f* while they are busy working, \add leaving behind their
riches\add*. 
\s James 1:12 
\s God blesses those who bravely endure difficulties; he will reward them by causing them to live eternally.
\p
\v 12  \add God\add* is pleased with the people who bravely\f + \ft Or: patiently \f* endure difficulties. And when,
\add by bravely enduring difficulties\add*, they have proved \add that they truly trust
him\add*, he will give them \add eternal\add* life. That is the reward \f + \ft metaphor \f* that he has promised to give to those who love
him. 
\s James 1:13-15 
\s If people are tempted to do evil, they should not think that it is God who is tempting them. It is their own evil desires
that are tempting them to do evil. 
\p
\v 13 If people are tempted to do what is evil, they should not think that it is God who is tempting them, because
\add God is totally\f + \ft Or: completely \f* good\add*. He never tempts anyone
\add to do what is evil\add*, nor can he ever be tempted to \add do
anything\add* evil. 
\v 14 But people strongly desire to do what is evil \f + \ft personification \f*, \add and as a
result\add* they are stimulated by those desires {those desires stimulate them} to want to do what is evil [PRS, DOU].
\v 15 Then, \add because\add* they have desired \f + \ft metaphor \f* to do what is evil \f + \ft personification \f*, they begin to \f + \ft metaphor \f* do \f + \ft personification \f* it. And when they
have become ones who \add habitually\add* do what is evil \f + \ft metaphor \f*,
\add if they do not turn away from their sinful behavior\add*, they will be separated from God forever.
\s James 1:16-18 
\s Stop thinking wrongly that God tempts you to do evil, because God does only good for us.
\p
\v 16 My fellow believers whom I love, stop deceiving yourselves,
\add thinking that God does what is evil\add*. 
\v 17  \add The truth is that God\add*, our heavenly Father \f + \ft metonymy \f*, does only what is good \f + \ft doublet \f*
\add for us, in order to help us become\add* all that he intends us to be. He is not like all the things
\add in the sky\add* that he created to give light\add , because
they\add* change\add ; that is, they do not shine the same all the
time\add*. But God never changes. \add He is always good\add*. 
\v 18  \add And because\add* he wanted \add to help us\add*, he gave us
\add spiritual\add* life as a result of our \add trusting in his\add* true message. So now we have become the first ones of
\add all the people\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* that he created \add to\add* ◄\add be totally dedicated to\f + \ft Or: completely \f* belong
to\add*► \add him\add*. 
\s James 1:19-20 
\s Every one of you should eagerly pay attention to God's message and should not speak hastily or be quick to get angry.
\p
\v 19 My fellow believers whom I love, you know (OR, I want you to now) that every one of you should be eager to pay attention
to \add God's true message\add*. You should not hastily speak \add your own
thoughts\add*, nor be quick to get angry, 
\v 20 because when any one \add of you gets\add* angry, you will not be doing the righteous things that God
\add wants\add* you\add to do\add*. 
\s James 1:21-25 
\s So stop doing all kinds of evil, and do what God commands in his message, instead of just listening to it. God approves of
those who do what he wants them to do. 
\p
\v 21 So stop doing all kinds of evil \f + \ft doublet \f*, and humbly accept (OR, submit to \f* the message that
\add God\add* planted in your inner beings\f + \ft Or: hearts \f*, \add because\add* he is able to save you \f + \ft synecdoche \f*
\add if you accept his message\add*. 
\v 22 Do \add what God commands in\add* his message. Do not only listen
\add to it, because people who only listen to it and do not obey
it\add* think wrongly \add that God will save them\add*. 
\v 23 Some people hear God's message but do not do \add what it says\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. They are like someone who looks at his face in
a mirror \f + \ft simile \f*. 
\v 24 Although he looks at himself, he goes away \add from the mirror\add* and immediately forgets what he looks like.
\v 25 But other people look closely at \add God's\add* message, which is perfect and which sets people free
\add to voluntarily do what God wants them to do\add*. And if they continue
\add to examine God's message\add* and do not just hear it and then forget it, but do
\add what God tells them to do\add*, God will bless them because of what they do.
\s James 1:26-27 
\s Those who show compassion on people in need and who do not think or act immorally are those who truly worship God and
receive his approval. 
\p
\v 26 Some people think that they worship God rightly, but they habitually speak evil talk \f + \ft metonymy \f*. Those people are wrong in
thinking \f + \ft synecdoche \f* \add that they worship God rightly\add*. The fact is
\add that they\add* worship God in vain\f + \ft Or: uselessly \f*. 
\v 27  \add One of the things that God has told us to do\add* is to take care of orphans and widows who suffer hardship.
\add Those who do that and\add* who do not think or act immorally like those who do not obey God \f + \ft metonymy \f* truly \f + \ft doublet \f* worship God,
\add who is our\add* Father, and God approves of them.
