\c 2  
\s James 2:1-11 
\s Stop honoring some people more than others, because by doing that, you are disobeying God's law that we should love one
another. 
\p
\v 1 My fellow believers, \add because\add* you trust our Lord Jesus Christ, the one who is glorious/wonderful, stop honoring
some people more than others. 
\v 2  \add For example\add*, suppose that a person who wears gold rings and fine clothes enters your meeting place. Then
suppose that a poor person who wears shabby/ragged clothes also comes in.
\v 3 And \add suppose\add* that you ◄show special attention to/treat better► the one who is dressed in fine clothes by saying,
“Sit here in this good seat!” and you say to the poor one, “Stand there or sit on the floor \f + \fr metonymy \f*!”
\v 4 Then you have obviously \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* caused divisions in the congregation (OR, you are clearly treating one better than the
others, and you are using evil \add motives/reasons\add* to ◄\add evaluate people/decide whether people are important or
not\add*►). 
\v 5 Listen \add to me\add*, my fellow believers whom I love. God has chosen \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* poor people whom
\add unbelievers consider to\add* possess nothing of value, \add in order that he might bless
them\add* abundantly \add because\add* they trust \add in him\add*, and in order that they will enter the place where
\add he\add* will rule \f + \fr metaphor \f* \add forever\add*. That is what he has promised to those who love him.
\v 6 But you dishonor the poor people. Think about it! ◄It is the rich people,
\add not the poor people\add*, who are causing you to suffer!/Isn't it the rich people,
\add not the poor people\add*, who are oppressing you?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* ◄It is
\add the rich people\add* who forcibly take you to court \add to accuse you in front of
judges\add*!/Is it not \add the rich people\add* who forcibly take you to court
\add to accuse you in front of judges\add*?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* 
\v 7 ◄And they are the ones who speak evil against Jesus Christ, the one who is worthy
\add of praise\add*, to whom you belong!/Are they not the ones who speak evil against Jesus Christ, the one who is worthy
\add of praise\add*, to whom you belong?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* 
\v 8  \add God has commanded you\add* in the Scriptures that each of you must love other people like you love yourself. That
commandment was \add also given\add* by \add Jesus our\add* King \f + \fr metonymy \f*. If you
\add are loving others\add*, you are doing what is right. 
\v 9 But if you honor some people more than others, you are ◄doing wrong/sinning►. And because you
\add do not do what God commanded us to do\add*, he condemns you \f + \fr personification \f* because you disobey his laws.
\p
\v 10 Do not forget that those who disobey only one of God's laws, even if they obey all
\add his other\add* laws, \add God considers them\add* to be \add as guilty as anyone who has
disobeyed\add* all \add of\add* God's\add laws\add*. 
\v 11 For example, \add God\add* said, “Do not commit adultery,” but he also said, “Do not murder anyone.”
\add So\add* if you\add (sg)\add* do not commit adultery but you\add (sg)\add* murder someone,
you\add (sg)\add* have become a person who disobeys \add God's\add* laws.
\s James 2:12-13 
\s Continually act mercifully toward others, because God will not act mercifully to those who do not act mercifully toward
others. 
\p
\v 12 Continually speak and act \add toward others\add* as people should who will be judged {whom
\add God\add* will judge} by the law that frees us \add from being
punished\add* {\add God punishing us\add*} \add for our sins\add*.
\v 13  \add Speak and act like that\add*, because when \add God\add* judges us, he will not act mercifully toward those who do
not act mercifully toward others. But when we \add are\add* merciful
\add to others, we can rejoice\add*, because \add our being\add* merciful
\add shows\add* that \add we are acting like people whom God\add* has mercifully saved from being judged (OR,
\add we can rejoice\add* because \add God\add* will judge us mercifully).
\s James 2:14-17 
\s Anyone who says that he trusts in Jesus Christ but does not act compassionately toward others is not truly trusting in
Jesus. 
\p
\v 14 My fellow believers, \add there are some people who say\add*, “I believe
\add in the Lord Jesus Christ\add*,” but they do not do good deeds
\add to other people\add*. ◄Their saying that will certainly not do them any good!/What good will their saying that do for
them?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* ◄\add God\add* will certainly not save \add people like that who say that they believe, but do not do good
deeds\add*!/Will God save \add people like that who say that they believe, but do not do good
deeds\add*?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* 
\v 15  \add To illustrate\add*, suppose that fellow believers, either men or women, are continually lacking clothing or lacking
food for each day. 
\v 16 And suppose that one of you says to them, “May \add God\add* bless you and supply the clothing and food that you need!”
but you\add (sg)\add* do not give them the things that they need. ◄That would be no help
\add to them\add*!/What help is that \add to them\add*?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* 
\v 17 Similarly, \add those who do\add* not do good deeds \add to help others, what they have said
about\add* their believing \add in Christ\add* is \add as useless\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f*
\add as\add* a dead person \add is useless\add*! They do not \add really believe in
Christ\add*. 
\s James 2:18-26 
\s But someone may claim that some people are saved because they trust in God and other people are saved because they do good
to others. In answer to that, the inadequacy of faith without good deeds is demonstrated by the example of demons. From the
examples of Abraham and Rahab we can see that only by obeying God and doing good to others can people prove that they truly
trust in God. 
\p
\v 18 But someone may say \add to me\add*, “\add God saves\add* some people only
\add because\add* they trust \add in him\add*, and \add he saves\add* others
\add because\add* they do good deeds \add to people\add*.” \add I would answer that
person\add*, “\add You(sg) cannot\add* prove to me that people truly trust
\add in God if\add* they do not do good deeds \add to others\add*! But by doing good deeds
\add to others\add* I will prove to you that I truly trust \add in
God\add*! 
\v 19  \add Think about it\add*! You believe that there is only one God, and you are right
\add to believe that\add*. But the demons also believe that, but they tremble
\add because they know that God is going to punish them\add*. 
\v 20 Also, you foolish person, I will \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* prove to you\add (sg)\add* that
\add if someone says\add*, ‘I trust \add in God\add*,’ but he does not do good deeds,
\add what that person says\add* will not benefit him. 
\v 21 ◄It was certainly\add because of\add* what our \add revered\add* ancestor Abraham did, when he
\add prepared to\add* sacrifice his son Isaac, that he was considered
\add by God\add* {that \add God\add* considered him} to be a righteous,
\add obedient\add* person./Was it not \add because of\add* what our
\add revered\add* ancestor Abraham did, when he \add prepared to\add* sacrifice his son Isaac, that he was considered
\add by God\add* {that \add God\add* considered him} to be a righteous,
\add obedient\add* person?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* 
\v 22 You\add (sg)\add* can realize that he was not only trusting
\add in God\add*, but he was also doing \add what God told him to
do\add*, and \add you(sg) can realize\add* that he was able to trust
\add in God more\add* completely because of having done \add what God told him to
do\add*. 
\v 23 And \add so it happened as it is written in the\add* Scriptures: ‘Because Abraham truly trusted in God, he was considered
\add by God\add* to be {\add God\add* considered that he was} righteous.’ And
\add God also\add* said \add about Abraham\add*, “He is my friend.”
\v 24  \add From the example of Abraham\add*, you can realize that it is because people do good deeds that
\add God\add* considers them to be righteous, and not only because they trust
\add in him\add*. 
\v 25 Similarly, it was certainly \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* \add because of\add* what Rahab did, that
\add God\add* considered her to be a righteous, \add obedient\add* person. Rahab was
\add previously\add* a prostitute, but she cared for the Israelite men who came
\add to\add* ◄\add spy out the land/see what that area was like\add*► and she
\add helped them to escape by\add* sending them home on a different
road\add from the one that they came on\add*. 
\p
\v 26 Remember that when our spirits \add permanently leave our\add* bodies,
\add our bodies\add* are dead \add and useless\add*. Similarly \f + \fr simile \f*,
\add if someone says\add*, “I trust \add in God\add*,” but does not do
\add things to help others, what that person says about trusting in
God\add* is useless.”
