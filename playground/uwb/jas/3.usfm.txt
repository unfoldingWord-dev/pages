\c 3  
\s James 3:1-12 
\s Not many of you should become teachers, because God will judge teachers with greater severity than he will judge others. You
should all strive to speak rightly, because what you say has a powerful effect on others, and it is often destructive and
hypocritical. 
\p
\v 1 My fellow believers, not many of you should \add desire to\add* become
teachers\add of God's truth, because\add* you know \add that God\add* will judge
us\add (exc)\add*, who teach others, more severely \add than he will judge other
people\add*. 
\v 2 It is true that we all in many ways do what is wrong \f + \ft metaphor \f*. But those who always \f + \ft litotes \f* control what they say will be all
that God intends\f + \ft Or: wants \f* them to be. They will be able to control all their actions \f + \ft metonymy \f*.
\v 3  \add To illustrate\add*, if we put \add a small metal\add* bit into the mouth of a horse in order to cause the horse to
obey us, we can cause the horse to turn \add and go where we want it
to\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. 
\v 4 Think also about ships. \add Although\add* a ship may be very large and
\add although\add* it can be moved by strong winds {strong winds can move it}, by
\add turning\add* a very small rudder\f + \ft Or: steering paddle \f* people can direct the ship wherever they
want\add it to go\add*. 
\v 5 Similarly, \add although\add* our tongues are very small, \add if we do not control
them\add*, we can \add harm\add* many people by what we proudly say \f + \ft metonymy \f*. Think
\add also\add* about how \add just\add* a small \add flame of\add* fire can cause a large forest \f + \ft Or: a large area of
brushwood \f* to burn. 
\p
\v 6  \add Just like a fire damages a forest\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, when we say things that are evil,
\add we harm many people\add*. What we say \f + \ft metonymy \f* reveals that there is much evil within us. What we say contaminates\f + \ft Or: defiles \f*
all that we think and do \f + \ft personification, metaphor \f*. \add Just like a flame of fire
easily\add* causes \add the whole surrounding area\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* to burn, what we say \f + \ft metonymy \f* can cause
\add others\add* to want to do evil. It is the devil himself \f + \ft metonymy \f* who causes us to speak what is evil.
\v 7 Indeed, although people are able to tame\f + \ft Or: control \f* all kinds of wild animals, birds, reptiles and creatures that live in the
water, and people have tamed\f + \ft Or: controlled \f* them, 
\v 8 no person \add on his own\f + \ft Or: by himself\add* \f* is able to control what he says \f + \ft metonymy \f*. And when people speak evilly,
\add it shows that\add* they are unstable\f + \ft Or: uncontrolled \f* and wicked \f + \ft metonymy \f*.
\add As\add* the poison \add of a snake kills people\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*,
\add we harm others\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* by what we say. 
\v 9 We use our tongue to praise God, who is our Lord and Father, but we also use our same tongue to ask God to do evil to
people. \add That is very wrong, because\add* God made people like himself.
\v 10 We praise \add God\add*, but with our same mouth we also ask for evil
\add things to happen to others\add*. My fellow believers, this should not be!
\v 11 Surely bitter water and good water do not come out of the same spring!\f + \ft Or: How can bitter water and good water come out of
the same spring? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* 
\v 12 My fellow believers, a fig tree cannot \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* produce olives. Nor can \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* a grapevine produce figs. Neither can a salty
spring produce good \add water\add*. \add Similarly, we should speak only what is good, and we should not speak what is
evil\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. 
\s James 3:13-18 
\s If you are jealous of others and self-seeking, do not boast that you are wise. Instead, demonstrate that you are truly wise
by doing good and by acting peaceably and compassionately toward others.
\p
\v 13 If any of you thinks \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* that \add you are\add* wise and know much, you should always act in a good way to show people
that your good deeds are the result of your \add being truly\add* wise. Being
wise\add helps us to act\add* gently \add toward others\add*. 
\v 14 But if in your inner beings\f + \ft Or: hearts \f* you are intensely, Or: very \f + \ft metaphor \f* jealous\f + \ft Or: unhappy when you see that someone else is
succeeding \f* and always want to have what you want, regardless of what others want, you should not say
\add that you are wise, for by boasting like that\add*, you are saying that
\add God's message\f + \ft Or: what God says about you\add* \f* is not true. 
\v 15 Those who have such \add attitudes are\add* not wise \f + \ft metonymy \f* in the way that God
\add wants them to be\add*. Instead, they are only thinking and acting like
\add ungodly people\f + \ft Or: people who do not please God\add* \f*. They think and act according to their own
\add evil\add* desires. They do what the demons \add want them to
do\add* \f + \ft Or: they think and act as demons \add do\add* \f*. 
\v 16  \add Keep in mind that\add* people who have such attitudes are unruly\f + \ft Or: do not submit to authority \f*
and\add do\add* all kinds of evil things. 
\v 17 But \add when people\add* are wise \f + \ft personification \f* in the way that God \f + \ft metonymy \f*
\add wants them to be\add*, they are pure in every way, which God considers to be very important. They also act peaceably
towards \add others\add*, they are considerate of\f + \ft Or: think about the rights and feelings of \f* others, they are willing to yield to
\add the wishes of\add* others, they act compassionately \add toward
others\add*, and they do all kinds of good things \add for others\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\add How they treat others does\add* not depend on others' status\f + \ft Or: whether others are important or not \f*, and they are sincere
\add in all they do\add*. 
\v 18 Those who \add act\add* peaceably \add toward others\add* cause the
\add others to also\add* act peaceably, with the result that they all live together
\add acting\add* righteously \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
