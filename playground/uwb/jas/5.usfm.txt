\c 5  
\s James 5:1-6 
\s The rich people who oppress you should weep because they will suffer much. God will punish them because they have unjustly
caused others to suffer. 
\p
\v 1 Now \add I have something to say to\add* the rich people \add who do not believe in Christ and
who\add* ◄\add oppress you/cause you to suffer\add*►. Listen \add to
me\add*, you rich people! You should weep and wail \add loudly\add* \f + \fk doublet \f* because you will experience terrible troubles \f + \fk personification \f*!
\v 2 Your wealth \add of various kinds\add* is \add worthless\add* \f + \fk metaphor \f*,
\add as though it were\add* rotted. Your fine clothes are \add worthless\add* \f + \fk metaphor \f*,
\add as though\add* termites had ruined them. 
\v 3 Your gold and silver are \add worthless\add* \f + \fk metaphor \f*, \add as though they
were\add* corroded. \add When God judges you\add*, this worthless wealth \f + \fk metonymy \f* of yours will be evidence \f + \fk personification \f* that you are
guilty \add of being greedy\add*, and as rust and fire \add destroy\add* [MET, SYN] things,
\add God\add* will severely punish you \f + \fk simile \f*. You have ◄\add in vain/uselessly\add*► ◄stored up/accumulated►
\add wealth\add* in a time when \add God\add* is about to \add judge
you\add* \f + \fk metonymy \f*. 
\v 4 Think \add about what you have done\add*. You have not paid wages to the workmen who have harvested your fields for you,
\add with the result that\add* \f + \fk personification \f* those reapers are crying out
\add to God for him to help them\add*. \add And God\add*, the all-powerful Lord, has heard their loud cries.
\v 5 You have lived luxuriously, just to have pleasure \add here\add* on earth.
\add Just like cattle fatten themselves, not realizing that\add* they will be slaughtered \f + \fk metaphor \f*, you have
\add lived just for pleasure\add* \f + \fk metonymy \f*, \add not realizing that God will severely punish
you\add*. 
\v 6 You have \add arranged for others/judges to\add* condemn innocent people. You have
\add arranged for others to kill\add* some people. \add And even
though\add* those people had not done anything wrong, they were not
\add able to\add* defend themselves against you. \add My fellow believers, that is what I say to the rich
people\add* ◄\add who oppress you/cause you to suffer\add*►. 
\s James 5:7-11 
\s So wait patiently for the Lord Jesus Christ to return and to judge all people fairly. Do not complain against each other,
lest Jesus judge you when he returns. From the examples of the prophets and Job, we know that God blesses and rewards those who
patiently endure suffering. 
\p
\v 7 So, my fellow believers, \add although rich people cause you to
suffer\add*, be patient until the Lord \add Jesus Christ\add* comes
\add back\add*. Remember that when farmers \add plant a field\add*, they wait for their valuable crops to grow. They must wait
patiently for the rain \add that comes\add* at the planting season and for more rain
\add that comes\add* just before the harvest season. They wait \add for\add* the crops
\add to grow and mature before they can harvest them\add*. 
\v 8  \add Similarly\add*, you also should \add wait\add* patiently and trust the Lord
\add Jesus\add* firmly, because he is coming \add back\add* soon
\add and will judge all people fairly\add*. 
\v 9 My fellow believers, do not complain against each other, in order that you will not be condemned
\add and punished by the Lord Jesus\add* {in order that \add the Lord
Jesus\add* will not condemn you}. It is he who will judge us, and he is ready to appear.
\v 10 My fellow believers, as an example \add of how to be patient\add*, ◄consider/think about► the prophets whom the Lord
\add God sent long ago\add* to speak his messages \f + \fk metonymy \f*. \add Although people
caused\add* them to suffer much, they endured it patiently. 
\v 11 And we know that \add God\add* ◄approves of/is pleased with► those who endure
\add suffering for him\add*. You have also heard about Job. You know
that\add although he suffered much\add*, the Lord \add God\add* finally brought good
\add to Job because\add* he endured \add that suffering\add* \f + \ft (OR, because he continued
\add to trust God\add*). \add And from that we know\add* that the Lord is very compassionate and kind.
\s James 5:12 
\s Do not say, “If I am lying, may God punish me.” Instead, always tell the truth, lest God condemn you.
\p
\v 12 Also, my fellow believers, \add I want to say\add* something important
\add about how you talk\add*. \add If you say that you will do something\add*, do not say, “If I do not do it, may
\add God in\add* heaven \f + \fk metonymy \f* punish me.” Do not even say, “If I do not do it, may
\add someone here on\add* earth \f + \fk metonymy \f* punish me.” Do not say anything like that. Instead, if you say ‘Yes,’ then
\add do what you said that you would do\add*. If you say ‘No,’ then do not
\add do it\add*. Otherwise, \add God\add* will condemn you. 
\s James 5:13-18 
\s Whatever your circumstances are, pray, trusting in God, and he will certainly help you, both physically and spiritually. So
confess your sins to each other and pray for each other, because God answers prayer.
\p
\v 13 Whoever among you is experiencing trouble \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* should pray
\add that God would help him. Whoever\add* is cheerful/happy \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* should sing songs of praise
\add to God\add*. 
\v 14 Whoever among you is sick \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* should call the leaders of the
congregation\add to come to pray for him\add*. They should put \add olive\add* oil on him and, with the Lord's authority \f + \fk metonymy \f*
(OR, calling on the Lord \add to heal him\add*) \f*, pray. 
\v 15 And if they truly trust \add in the Lord\add* when they pray \f + \fk personification \f*, the sick person will be healed. The Lord will heal
him. And if that person has sinned ◄\add in a way that caused him to be/and because of that he
became\add*► \add sick, if he\add* ◄\add confesses what he did/says that he did what is
wrong\add*►, he will be forgiven {\add the Lord\add* will forgive him}.
\v 16 So, \add because the Lord is able to heal the sick and to forgive
sins\add*, tell each other the sinful things that you have done, and pray for each other in order that you may be healed {that
\add God\add* may heal you} \add physically and spiritually\add*. If righteous people
\add pray and\add* ask fervently \add for God to do something, God\add* will act powerfully and will certainly do it.
\v 17  \add Although the prophet\add* Elijah was ◄an ordinary person/just a human being► like us, he earnestly prayed that it
would not rain. \add As a result\add*, it did not rain for three and a half years.
\v 18 Then he prayed again, \add asking God to send rain\add*, and
\add as a result God\add* \f + \fk metonymy \f* sent rain, and plants \add grew and\add* produced crops
\add again\add*. 
\s James 5:19-20 
\s If anyone turns away from God's true message, you believers should urge him to once again obey God so that God will forgive
his many sins. 
\p
\v 19 My fellow believers, if anyone of you stops obeying the true message
\add from God\add*, someone from among you should persuade that person to once again do
\add what God has told us to do\add*. \add If he stops doing what is
wrong\add*, 
\v 20 the one \add who persuaded him\add* should realize that \add because\add* he has enabled the person who was sinning to
stop doing what is wrong, \add God\add* will save that person from
◄\add spiritual\add* death/being separated from him forever►, and will forgive
\add his\add* many sins.
