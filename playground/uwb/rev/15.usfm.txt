\c 15  
\s Revelation 15:1 
\s John saw in the sky a marvelous sign of the seven angels who were responsible to inflict the seven last plagues.
\p
\v 1 Something else very unusual \add appeared\add* in the sky. I saw seven angels, whose duty it was to
\add punish\add* \f + \ft Or: inflict hardship upon \f* \add rebellious people\add* with seven different plagues \f + \ft Or: in seven different
ways \f*. God is so angry \add with rebellious people that\add* this is the last
\add time that he will punish them with the purpose of giving them an opportunity to turn away from their sinful
behavior\add*. 
\s Revelation 15:2-4 
\s John saw those who had been victorious over the beast respond to God's judgment of rebellious people on earth by singing
God's praise for his mighty deliverance and righteous judgment. 
\p
\v 2 I saw what looked like an ocean \add that was made of\add* glass and mixed with fire. And I saw the people who overcame
the beast \add by not worshipping it\add* or its image, or \add allowing its agent to mark them
with\add* the number that corresponds to the beast's name \f + \ft personification \f*. They were standing by the ocean
\add that looked like it was made\add* of glass. They had harps \add for
praising\add* God. 
\v 3 They were singing a song \add like\add* God's servant Moses
\add sang long ago\add*. They sang \add like this to praise Jesus, the one who is
like\add* a lamb: 
\q Lord God Almighty, 
\q whatever you do is powerful and marvelous! 
\q You always act righteously and truthfully. 
\q You are king forever! 
\q
\v 4 O Lord, you alone are holy! 
\q People of \f + \ft metonymy \f* all nations will come and worship you, 
\q because you show everyone that you have judged everyone righteously.
\q So, everyone will fear you and honor you!\f + \ft Or: who would not fear and honor you? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*.
\s Revelation 15:5-8 
\s John saw angels being given the seven bowls of judgment in the heavenly sanctuary, which became filled with the smoke of
God's unapproachable glory. 
\p
\v 5 After this I saw in heaven the temple \add that corresponds to\f + \ft Or: was represented
by\add* \f* the tent \add that the Israelites pitched in the desert. That was the tent that
contained\add* the \add Ten Commandments. The temple door\add* was opened {was open}.
\v 6 The seven angels \add who had the bowls containing\add* the seven plagues came out of the temple. The angels were dressed
in clean, white linen \add garments\add*, and they wore gold bands around their chests.
\v 7 One of the four living \add creatures\add* gave \add each of\add* the seven angels a golden bowl, filled with
\add wine\f + \ft Or: liquid \f*. That wine\f + \ft Or: liquid \f* symbolized\add* that God, who lives forever, would severely punish
\add rebellious people\add*. 
\v 8 The temple was filled with smoke \add that symbolized\add* the presence of the glorious and all-powerful God. No one was
able to enter the temple until the seven angels finished \add pouring
out\add* the seven plagues.
