\s Revelation 12:1-6 
\s When the royal woman gave birth to a kingly son, she fled to safety and care in a place in the wilderness that was prepared
by God. 
\p
\v 1 Then something very unusual appeared in the sky. It was a woman, whose
\add appearance and\add* clothing were \f + \ft metaphor \f* as bright as the sun. The moon was under her feet. On her head was a crown
\add that was made\add* of twelve stars. 
\v 2 She was pregnant. Then, because she was about to give birth, she cried out because she was suffering pain.
\v 3 Something else very unusual appeared in the sky. It was a huge red dragon. It had seven heads and ten horns. On each of
its heads was a royal crown. 
\v 4 The dragon's tail dragged a third of the stars from the sky and threw them to the earth. The dragon set himself in front
of the woman who was about to give birth, in order that he might eat her child as soon as it was born.
\v 5 She gave birth to a son, who \add is destined\add* to rule all the nations with
\add complete authority as if he was using\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* an iron rod \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\add God\add* snatched away her child and took him to \add rule from\add* his throne.
\v 6 The woman fled to a desert. She has a place there that God has prepared for her, in order that
\add the angels\add* may take care of her for a thousand, two hundred and sixty days.
\s Revelation 12:7-12 
\s There was a battle in heaven in which Michael and his angels fought the dragon. The dragon and his angels were thrown out of
heaven to earth. A loud voice from heaven declared the victory and the sovereignty of God and lamented the tragic struggle
coming to people on earth. 
\p
\v 7 There was a battle in heaven. Michael and the angels that he
\add commanded\add* fought against the dragon. The dragon and his angels fought back
\add against Michael and his angels\add*. 
\v 8 But the dragon did not win the battle, so \add God\add* did not allow the dragon and his angels to stay in heaven any
longer. 
\v 9 The huge dragon was thrown {\add Michael and his angels\add* threw the huge dragon} out
\add of heaven\add*. The dragon is the ancient serpent, \add the
one\add* who is called the Devil and Satan. He is the one who deceives
\add people all over\add* the earth. He was thrown to the earth, along with all his angels.
\v 10 Then I heard \add someone\add* in heaven shout loudly, saying,
\q Now our God has saved his people by his power, and he rules all people!
\q Now his Messiah, who is the supreme ruler whom God appointed,
\q has authority to rule all people, because our God has thrown out of heaven the one who accuses our fellow believers!
\q The dragon is the one who accuses them day and night before our God,
\q saying that they have sinned and that God ought punish them. 
\q
\v 11 Our fellow believers overcame him because they never stopped trusting
\q \f + \ft Or: never stopped telling people about) Jesus, 
\q and because they trusted in what the one who is like a lamb accomplished
\q when his blood flowed when he died. 
\q Even though those believers wanted to live, 
\q they were willing to let people kill them for speaking truly about him.
\q
\v 12 So, all you angels living \f + \ft metonymy \f* in heaven, rejoice! 
\q But terrible things will happen to you ungodly people who \f + \ft metonymy \f* live on the earth and
\q on the ocean, because the devil has come down to you! 
\q He is very angry because he knows that he has only a short time
\q during which he can harm people. 
\s Revelation 12:13-18 
\s When the dragon pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child, he was thwarted, so he prepared to fight against
her other offspring. 
\p
\v 13 When the dragon realized that he had been thrown {that \add the
angels\add* had thrown him} down to the earth, he pursued the woman who had given birth to a son.
\v 14 But the woman was given two wings like the wings of a very large eagle, in order that she might fly to a desolate place.
That is a place \add that God\add* has prepared for her. There she was taken care of
{\add God's angels\add* took care of her} for three and one half years. The serpent,
\add that is, the dragon\add*, was not able to reach her there. 
\v 15 The serpent poured water like a river from his mouth in the direction of the woman, in order that the water might sweep
her away. 
\v 16 But the ground helped the woman \add by\add* opening up and swallowing the river that the dragon poured out from his
mouth! 
\v 17 Then the dragon was very angry with the woman, so he went away to fight against
\add the people who are like\add* the rest of her descendants. They are the people who obey God's commandments and who tell
other people about Jesus (OR, hold fast to what Jesus taught them \f*.
\v 18 The dragon stood on the ocean shore.
