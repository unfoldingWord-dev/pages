\c 16  
\s Revelation 16:1-9 
\s Four angels emptied their judgment bowls. 
\p
\v 1  \add In the vision\add* I heard \add someone\add* in the temple speak in a loud voice to the angels
\add who had the seven bowls\add*. He said, "Go \add from here\add* and pour out on the earth
\add the wine\f + \ft Or: liquid \f* in\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* the seven bowls. \add This will show
that\add* God is angry with \add rebellious people and will punish
them\add*." 
\v 2 So the first angel went and poured out on the earth \add the wine\f + \ft Or: liquid \f* that was
in\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* his bowl. \add As a result\add*, horrible and painful sores broke out on his enemies who had allowed the beast's
\add agents\add* to mark them and who worshipped the image of the beast.
\v 3 The second angel poured out on the ocean \add the wine\f + \ft Or: liquid \f* that was
in\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* his bowl. \add As a result\add*, the \add water in the ocean stank like the
blood\add* of a person who has died. \add And\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* every living creature that was in the ocean died.
\v 4 The third angel poured out on the rivers and water springs\add the
wine\f + \ft Or: liquid \f*\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add that was in\add* his bowl. \add As a result, the water in the rivers and
springs\add* turned into blood. 
\v 5 I heard the angel \add who has authority over\add* the waters say
\add to God\add*, "\add O God\add*, you exist and have always existed. You are the holy one. You judge people justly.
\v 6  \add The rebellious people\add* murdered your holy people and prophets. So you are just in punishing them by giving them
blood to drink. This is what they deserve!" 
\v 7 Then I heard \add an angel\add* respond \add from\add* the altar \f + \ft personification \f*, "Yes, Lord God, you who are almighty, you punish
\add people\add* rightly and justly!" 
\v 8 Then the fourth angel poured out on the sun \add the wine\f + \ft Or: liquid \f* that was
in\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* his bowl. \add He\add* enabled the sun to scorch \add people\add* with fiery
\add heat\add*. 
\v 9 Because people were severely burned by the intense heat \f + \ft Or:the intense heat severely burned people \f*, they said evil things
about God \f + \ft metonymy \f*, \add because\add* he had the power \add to strike people
with\add* plagues like those. But they refused to turn away from their evil behavior and refused to honor him.
\s Revelation 16:10-16 
\s Two more angels emptied their judgment bowls on the earth. Demons gathered armies to fight against God. But Jesus warned his
people to watch faithfully for his imminent coming. The battle was ready to begin at Armageddon.
\p
\v 10 When the fifth angel poured out on the throne of the beast
\add the wine\f + \ft Or: liquid \f* that was in\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* his bowl, it became dark in the kingdom that the beast
\add ruled. As a result, the beast and the people whom it ruled\add* were biting their tongues because
\add they were suffering intense\add* pain. 
\v 11 They insulted God \add who rules in\add* heaven, because their sores were so painful. But they refused to stop doing the
\add evil\add* things that they were doing. 
\v 12 The sixth angel poured out on the huge river Euphrates \add the wine\f + \ft Or: liquid \f* that was
in\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* his bowl. \add As a result, the\add* water \add in the
river\add* was dried up so that the rulers from the eastern \f + \ft metonymy \f*
\add countries could cross it with their armies\add* \f + \ft synecdoche \f*. 
\v 13 I saw evil spirits that looked like frogs. One came out of the mouth of the dragon, one from the mouth of the beast, and
one from the mouth of the false prophet. 
\v 14 Those spirits were demons who were \add able to\add* perform miracles. They went out to the rulers of the whole world, in
order to gather their \add armies\add* \f + \ft synecdoche \f* together to the battle that
\add they will fight\add* on the great day when Almighty God \add punishes his
enemies\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*. 
\v 15-16 The evil spirits will gather the rulers at a place that is called in the Hebrew
\add language\add* Armageddon. 
\p \add I heard the Lord Jesus say\add*, "\add You must\add* listen carefully to
\add me\add*: I am coming unexpectedly \f + \ft simile \f*, like a thief\add .
So\add*, I will be happy with those who stay alert and \add keep on living righteously so that they will not be
ashamed\add*, just like \f + \ft metaphor \f* a person keeps his clothes \add on\add* so that he will not be ashamed
\add like a person who is\add* naked." 
\s Revelation 16:17-21 
\s After the seventh angel emptied his bowl, God punished the very evil city symbolized by Babylon, and destroyed other cities,
and great disasters followed. 
\p
\v 17 The seventh angel poured out into the air \add the wine\f + \ft Or: liquid \f* that was
in\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* his bowl. \add As a result, someone\add* said with a loud voice from the throne in the temple,
"\add The time for God to punish rebellious people\add* is \add about to
be\add* finished." 
\v 18  \add When the angel emptied his bowl\add*, lightning flashed, there were rumblings and thunder, and the earth shook. It
shook more violently than it has ever shaken since people first \add lived\add* on earth.
\v 19 And \add as a result\add*, the very evil city \add that is symbolized by
Babylon\add* split into three parts. \add God also\add* destroyed cities in
\add other\add* nations. God did not forget that \add the people
of\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* the very evil \add city symbolized by\add* Babylon
\add had sinned very much\add*. So he \add caused the people with
whom\add* he was furiously angry \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add to drink\add* a cup of very
\add poisonous wine\f + \ft Or: liquid \f* that represented his punishment\add*.
\v 20 Also \add as a result of the earthquake\add*, every island disappeared, and the mountains became flat land.
\v 21 Also \add as a result of the angel's emptying his bowl\add*, huge hailstones, each weighing about 100 pounds, fell from
the sky onto the people. Then people insulted God because \add he had
caused\add* the terrible plague of destructive hail to fall on them.
