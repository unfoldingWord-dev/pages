\c 4  
\s Revelation 4:1-11 
\s A throne was in heaven with one sitting on it. He was the center of every creature and object in heaven. The elders and the
living creatures worshipped him as God, the mighty Creator. 
\p
\v 1 After these things I, \add John\add*, saw \add in the vision
that\add* there was a door open in heaven. The one whose voice was like \f + \ft simile \f* a
\add loud\add* trumpet, the one\add who had spoken to me\add* previously, said
\add to me\add*, “Come up here! I will show you events that must happen later.”
\v 2 Immediately I experienced that \add God's\add* Spirit \add was specially controlling
me\add*. There was a throne there in heaven, and on the throne someone was sitting
\add and ruling\add*. 
\v 3 His appearance\f + \ft Or: He \f* \add shone\add* like \f + \ft simile \f* a \add brilliant
crystalline\add* jasper \add jewel\add* and like a \add brilliant
red\add* carnelian \add jewel\add*. Around the throne was a rainbow that
\add shone like a brilliant green\add* emerald \add jewel\add*. 
\v 4 Around the throne there were twenty-four other thrones. On these thrones twenty-four elders were
\add sitting\add*. They were wearing \add pure\add* white garments and had golden crowns on their heads.
\v 5 From the throne there came lightning and rumblings and thundering. Seven torches of fire were burning in front of the
throne. Those \add represent\add* the Spirit of God, who has all kinds of
\add power\add* \f + \ft Or: who is \add also\add* symbolized as seven spirits).
\v 6 In front of the throne \add there was what looked\add* like an ocean
\add made of\add* glass. It was \add clear\add*, like crystal. On each of the four sides of the throne there was a living
\add creature\add*. Each one was covered with eyes in front and behind.
\v 7-8 The first living \add creature\add* was like a lion. The second living
\add creature\add* was like an ox. The third living \add creature\add* had a face like a man's face. The fourth living creature
was like an eagle that was flying. Each of the four living \add creatures\add* had six wings. They were covered with eyes, all
around \add their bodies\add* and under \add their wings\add*. Day and night they continually \f + \ft litotes \f* sing:
\q Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God, the Almighty One. 
\q He is the one who has always existed, 
\q who exists now, and who will always exist. 
\p
\v 9-10 The living \add creatures praise\add*, honor \f + \ft doublet \f*, and thank the one who sits on the throne, the one who lives
forever. Whenever they do that, the twenty-four elders prostrate themselves\f + \ft Or: kneel down \f* before the one who sits on the throne,
and they worship him, the one who lives forever. They lay their crowns in front of the throne and sing:
\q
\v 11 Our(exc \f* Lord and God, 
\q you are worthy that all beings praise you, 
\q you are worthy that all beings honor you, and 
\q you are worthy that all beings acknowledge 
\q that you are the powerful one, 
\q because you alone created all things. 
\q Moreover, because you purposed\f + \ft Or: planned \f* that they should exist,
\q you created them, and as a result they exist.
