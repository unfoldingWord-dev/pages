\s Revelation 7:1-8 
\s An angel ascended from the east and commanded the four angels stationed in four directions to continue restraining the
destructive winds until angels had sealed God's servants. 
\p
\v 1 After this I saw four angels. One was standing at the north, one at the east, one at the south, and one at the west. They
were restraining the winds that blew from all directions \f + \ft metonymy \f* to keep them from blowing
\add destructively\add* on the earth or on the ocean or even on any tree.
\v 2 I saw another angel ascend from the east. He was carrying God's seal.
\add With this\add* seal God, who is all-powerful, marks \add his own people to protect
them\add*. He called out with a loud voice to the four angels to whom
\add he\add* had given \add power\add* to harm the earth and the ocean. He said
\v 3  \add to them\add*, “Do not harm the earth or the ocean or the trees until
we\add (exc)\add* have marked the servants of our\add (inc)\add* God on their foreheads.”
\v 4  \add Then the angel and his fellow angels marked all God's
servants\add*. I heard the number of people who were marked {whom
\add the angels\add* marked} \add because of their being God's servants. The number
was\add* one hundred and forty-four thousand. They were from all the tribes of Israel.
\add They symbolized the complete number of people whom God would
protect\add*. 
\v 5  \add The angels\add* marked twelve thousand people from the tribe of Judah, twelve thousand from the tribe of Reuben,
twelve thousand from the tribe of Gad, 
\v 6 twelve thousand from the tribe of Asher, twelve thousand from the tribe of Naphtali, twelve thousand from the tribe of
Manasseh, 
\v 7 twelve thousand from the tribe of Simeon, twelve thousand from the tribe of Levi, twelve thousand from the tribe of
Issachar, 
\v 8 twelve thousand from the tribe of Zebulun, twelve thousand from the tribe of Joseph, and twelve thousand from the tribe of
Benjamin. 
\s Revelation 7:9-12 
\s The triumphant crowd stood before the throne in heaven and acknowledged that their deliverance had come from God and the
Lamb. Then the angels, the elders, the living creatures, and a huge crowd of people worshipped God in praise.
\p
\v 9 After these things I saw a huge crowd. There were so \add many
people\add* that no one would be able to count them. \add They were\add* from every nation, every tribe, every people-group,
and every language \f + \ft metonymy \f*. They were standing before the throne and before
\add Jesus, the one who is like a\add* lamb. They were wearing white robes and held palm branches
\add to wave\add* with their hands \add in order to celebrate\add*.
\v 10 They shouted loudly, “\add O\add* our\add (exc)\add* God, you who sit on the throne, and
\add Jesus, you who are like a\add* lamb, \add you two\add* have delivered
\add us(exc) from Satan's power!\add*” 
\v 11 All the angels were standing around the throne and around the elders and the four living
\add creatures\add*. They all bowed down before the throne with their faces
\add to the ground\add* and worshipped God. 
\v 12 They said, “May it be so! \add We(exc)\add* praise, thank, and honor
\add you\add*, our\add (exc)\add* God, forever! \add We(exc) acknowledge\add* that you are completely wise, the powerful one,
who is able to do all things forever! It is so!\f + \ft Or: Amen! \f*” 
\s Revelation 7:13-17 
\s One of the elders explained to John about the saints who are dressed in white robes.
\p
\v 13 Then one of the elders asked me, “These \add people\add* who are wearing white robes,
\add do you know\add* who they are, and where they come from?” 
\v 14 I answered him, “Sir, \add I do not know. Surely\add* \bd you\bd* know
\add who they are!\add*” He said to me, “These are the people ◄whom
\add others\add* have caused to suffer greatly\f + \ft Or: who \f* \add have been
persecuted\add*►. \add Because they believed that Jesus, the one who is like a
sacrificial\add* lamb, \add atoned for our sin when\add* his blood\add flowed from his body when he died, it is as
though\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* they have washed their robes and have made them
\add clean and\add* white. 
\v 15 Because of this, they are in front of God's throne, and they serve him day and night in his
\add heavenly temple. God\add*, the one who sits on the throne, will shelter\f + \ft Or: protect \f* them \f + \ft metonymy \f*.
\v 16  \add As a result\add*, they will never again be hungry. They will never again be thirsty. The sun will never again beat
on\f + \ft Or: burn \f* them, nor will any heat \add scorch them\add*. 
\v 17 This is because the \add one who is like a\add* lamb who is at the throne will
\add take care of them, just like\add* a shepherd \add takes care of his
sheep\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. He will guide them \add to the source of eternal life, just like a shepherd leads his
sheep\add* to springs of water, \add which enable the sheep\add* to live \f + \ft metaphor \f*. God will
\add cause them to no longer be sad. It will be as if he were\add* wiping away all tears from their eyes \f + \ft metonymy \f*.”
