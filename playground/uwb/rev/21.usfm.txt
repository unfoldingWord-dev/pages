\c 21  
\s Revelation 21:1-4 
\s John saw a new heaven, a new earth, and a New Jerusalem, where God will dwell permanently with his people.
\p
\v 1 Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth. The first heaven and the first earth had disappeared, and the oceans no longer
existed. 
\v 2 I saw \add God's\add* holy city, which is the new \add city
of\add* Jerusalem. It was coming down out of heaven from God. \add The
city\add* had been prepared \add and decorated\add* {\add God\add* had prepared
\add and decorated the city\add*} as \f + \fr simile \f* a bride is decorated {decorates herself}
\add beautifully in order to marry\add* her husband. 
\v 3 I heard a loud voice that spoke from the throne \add of God\add*. It said, “Listen to this! Now God will live with people.
He will live \add right in the midst of\add* them \f + \fr doublet \f*! They will be his people. God himself will be with them, and he will be
their God. 
\v 4  \add As a result\add*, he will \add cause them to no longer be sad. It will be as though he
will\add* \f + \fr metonymy \f* wipe every tear from their eyes. \add None of them\add* will ever again die or mourn or cry \f + \fr doublet \f* or suffer
pain, because the former things \add that make us sad\add* will have passed away.”
\s Revelation 21:5-8 
\s God declares that he has made everything new and that everything has been accomplished. He declares himself to be the
beginning and the end, and so he will provide abundant eternal life to all who seek him, but punishment in the lake of fire
will be the lot of all the wicked. 
\p
\v 5 Then \add God\add*, who sits on the throne, said, “Listen to this! I am
\add now\add* making everything new!” He said \add to me\add*: “Write these things
\add that I have told you\add*, because you can trust \add that I will certainly cause them to
happen\add*.” 
\v 6 He said to me, “I have completed \add all these things\add*! I am the one who began all things \f + \fr metaphor \f* and the one who will
cause all things to end \f + \fr metaphor \f*. To everyone who is \add spiritually\add* thirsty \f + \fr metaphor \f*, I will ◄freely give/give as a free gift►
water from the spring \add that causes people\add* to live \add forever\add*.
\v 7 I will give this to every person who is victorious over \add the evil
powers\add* \f + \fr (OR\add , over Satan\add*). I will be their God, and they will be my children.
\v 8 But those who are cowardly, those who do not believe \add in
me\add*, those \add who do\add* detestable things, those who are murderers, those who sin sexually, those who commit sorcery,
those who worship idols, and every liar, will \add all suffer\add* in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur.
\add Anyone who suffers in that lake\add* will be dying the second time.”
\s Revelation 21:9 
\s One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls offered to show to John the Bride of the Lamb.
\p
\v 9 One of the seven angels who had one of the seven bowls that had been full of
\add the wine/liquid causing\add* \f + \fr metonymy \f* the seven last plagues came and said to me, “Come
\add with me\add* and I will show you \add the people who have permanently united with Christ, the one who is like
a\add* lamb! They will be \add like\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f* a bride \add for him\add*.”
\s Revelation 21:10-14 
\s An angel showed John the city of God, the New Jerusalem, that was coming down out of heaven from God, shining with his
glory, having a huge wall with twelve gates and twelve huge foundation stones.
\p
\v 10 Then, while \add God's\add* Spirit \add controlled me\add*, the angel took/carried me to the top of a very high mountain.
He showed me \add God's\add* holy city, \add the New\add* Jerusalem. It was coming down out of heaven from God.
\v 11 It was shining with his glory. The city was shining like a very precious jasper stone
\add shines, and\add* it was clear like crystal. 
\v 12  \add Around the city\add* was a very high wall. The wall had twelve gates. An angel was at each gate. The names of the
twelve tribes of Israel were written {\add God\add* had written the names of the twelve tribes of Israel} over the gates.
\add Each gate had the name of one tribe\add*. 
\v 13 Three gates were on the east \add side\add*, three gates were on the north
\add side\add*, three gates were on the south \add side\add*, and three gates were on the west
\add side\add*. 
\v 14 The wall of the city had twelve foundation \add stones\add*. On each foundation
\add stone was\add* the name of one of the twelve apostles of \add Jesus, the one who is like
a\add* lamb. 
\s Revelation 21:15-17 
\s The angel guide measured the city and its wall. 
\p
\v 15 The angel who was speaking to me carried a golden measuring rod, in order to measure the city, its gates, and its wall.
\v 16 The city was square \add in shape\add*; it was as long as it was wide. After the angel measured the city with his rod,
\add he reported that it was\add* ◄1500 miles/2400 kilometers► long, and that its width and height were each the same as
\add its length\add*. 
\v 17 He measured its wall \add and reported that it was\add* ◄\add 216 ft./70
meters\add*► \add thick\add* (OR, \add high\add*). The angel used the measure that people
\add normally use\add*. 
\s Revelation 21:18-27 
\s John described the composition of the city, its wall, its foundations, its gates, and its street, emphasizing the extreme
value of each part. 
\p
\v 18 The \add city\add* wall was made of \add something like the green stone that we
call\add* jasper. The city \add itself\add* was \add made of something
like\add* pure gold \add that looked\add* like clear glass. 
\v 19 The foundations of the wall of the city were beautifully made with
\add wonderful stones that are like\add* precious stones \add on
earth\add*. The first foundation \add stone was a crystalline stone
like\add* jasper, the second \add foundation stone was a blue stone
like\add* sapphire, the third \add foundation stone was a green stone
like\add* agate, the fourth \add foundation stone was a green stone
like\add* emerald, 
\v 20 the fifth \add foundation stone was a brown and white layered stone
like\add* sardonyx, the sixth \add foundation stone was a red stone
like\add* carnelian, the seventh \add foundation stone was a yellow stone
like\add* chrysolite, the eighth \add foundation stone was a green stone
like\add* beryl, the ninth \add foundation stone was a yellow stone
like\add* topaz, the tenth \add foundation stone was a green stone
like\add* chrysoprase, the eleventh \add foundation stone was a blue stone
like\add* hyacinth, the twelfth \add foundation stone was a purple stone
like\add* amethyst. 
\v 21 The twelve gates \add of the city\add* were \add something like
huge\add* pearls. Each gate was like \add it was\add* a single pearl. The
\add ground of\add* the main plaza of the city (OR, The streets of the city) \f*
\add appeared to be\add* pure gold \add that looked\add* like clear glass.
\p
\v 22 There was no temple in the city. The Lord God Almighty \add himself\add*, and the
\add one who is like a\add* lamb, are \add there, so there was no need
for\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f* a temple. 
\v 23 The city will not need the sun or the moon to light the city, because the glory of God will light the city, and
\add Jesus, the one who is like a\add* lamb, will also be its light.
\v 24 The people of \f + \fr metonymy \f* the nations will live with the light of the city
\add shining upon them\add*. And the kings of the earth will bring their wealth into the city
\add to honor God and the one who is like a lamb\add*. 
\v 25 The gates of the city will not be shut {No one will shut the gates of the city}
\add at the end of the day as they usually are shut\add*, because there will be no night there.
\v 26 The \add people of the\add* world will also bring their wealth into the city to honor
\add God and the one who is like a lamb\add*. 
\v 27 No one who is morally impure, no one who does deeds \add that God
considers\add* detestable, no one who tells lies, will ever enter that city. Only those people whose names are written in the
book of the \add one who is like a\add* lamb {whose \add names\add* the
\add one who is like a\add* lamb has written in his book}, \add the
names\add* of people who have \add eternal\add* life, will be there.
