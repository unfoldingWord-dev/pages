\c 14  
\s Revelation 14:1-5 
\s John saw the Lamb standing on Mount Zion with 144,000 redeemed people, who were marked with God's seal. They were singing a
new song that only the redeemed could sing. 
\p
\v 1 But then I saw the \add one who is like a\add* lamb standing on Zion Hill
\add in Jerusalem\add*. With him were 144,000 \add people\add*. His name and his Father's name had been written
{\add He\add* had written his name and his Father's name} on their foreheads.
\v 2 I heard a sound from heaven, which was as \add loud\add* \f + \ft simile \f* as the sound of a huge waterfall \f + \ft Or: a great( Or: wide )
\add river of rushing\add* water \f* and which was \add as loud as\add* \f + \ft simile \f* mighty thunder. The sound that I heard was like
\add the sound that\add* people make when they are playing their harps.
\v 3 The 144,000 people were singing a new song \add while they stood\add* in front of the throne, in front of the four living
\add creatures\add*, and in front of the elders. Only the 144,000
\add people\add*, the ones who have been {whom \add the one who is like a
lamb\add* has} redeemed\f + \ft Or: bought \f* from among the people on the earth, could learn that song. No one else could learn the song
\add that they sang\add*. 
\v 4 Those 144,000 are the people who are \add spiritually\add* pure\add ,
like\add* virgins \add are morally pure\add*. They have not defiled themselves\f + \ft Or: made themselves impure \f* \f + \ft metaphor \f*
\add by worshipping any false god\add*. They are the ones who accompany Jesus, the
\add one who is like a\add* lamb, wherever he goes. They \add represent all those whom he
has\add* redeemed\f + \ft Or: bought \f* for God from among the people \add of earth, in order that he might
offer\add* them to God and to \add himself\add*. 
\v 5  \add Those people\add* never lie when they speak \f + \ft metonymy \f*, and they never act immorally.
\s Revelation 14:6-13 
\s An angel announced that God's judgment had destroyed the wicked cities symbolized as Babylon. Another angel declared
individual judgment on worshipers of the beast, who symbolizes the head of this world power. The saints are called to remain
steadfast. 
\p
\v 6 I saw another angel that was flying between the sky and heaven. He was bringing
\add God's\add* eternal good message \add to earth\add*, in order that he might proclaim it to people who live on the earth. He
will proclaim it to every nation, \add to every\add* tribe, \add to speakers of
every\add* language \f + \ft metonymy \f*, and \add to every\add* people-\add group\add*.
\v 7 He said in a loud voice, “Reverence God and honor him, because it is now time for him to judge
\add people!\add* Worship \add God, because he is\add* the one who created the heaven, the earth, the ocean, and the springs of
water.” 
\v 8 Another angel, the second one, came after him saying, “The very evil
\add cities\add* (OR\add , city\add*) \add represented by\add* Babylon are completely destroyed!
\add God\add* has punished \add their people because\add* they \add have persuaded people
of\add* all the nations \add to forsake God, just like a prostitute\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* persuades
\add men\add* to drink \add strong\add* wine and \add as a result\add* commit sexual immorality.”
\v 9 Another angel, the third one, came afterward, saying in a loud voice, “If people worship the beast and its image and
\add allow\add* its mark to be put {its \add agent to\add* put its mark} on their foreheads or on their hands,
\v 10 God will be angry with them and punish them very severely \f + \ft metaphor \f*. They will be tormented
{\add God\add* will torment them} in burning sulfur in the presence of his holy angels and in the presence of the
\add one who is like a\add* lamb. 
\v 11 The smoke \add from the fire\add* that torments them will rise forever.
\add They will\add* be tormented {\add God will\add* torment them} continually, day and night.
\add That is what will happen to\add* the people who worship the beast and its image and who allow its name to be marked on
them {allow \add its agent\add* to mark them with its name}.” 
\v 12 So God's people, those who obey what God commands and who trust in Jesus, must faithfully continue
\add obeying and trusting him\add*. 
\v 13 I heard a voice from heaven saying, “Write \add this: God will\add* now
\add abundantly\add* bless the people who have a close relationship with the Lord
\add Jesus\add* for the rest of \add their lives\add*.” \add God's\add* Spirit says, “Yes,
\add after they die\add* they will no longer have to work hard. Instead, they will rest, and
\add the record of the good deeds\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* that they have done will go with them \f + \ft Or:
\add God\add* will \add reward them\add* for the good deeds that they have done \f*.”
\s Revelation 14:14-20 
\s One like the Son of Man sat on a cloud, holding a sharp sickle. An angel from the sanctuary commanded him to harvest the
earth. Another angel was commanded to reap the fruit of the vine of the earth. He threw the fruit that he harvested into the
winepress of God's anger. When the winepress was trodden, the flow was like a flood of blood on the earth.
\p
\v 14 Then I was surprised to see a white cloud, and on the cloud
\add someone\add* was sitting who looked like the one who came from heaven. He
\add was wearing\add* a golden crown on his head. In his hand \add he
held\add* a sharp sickle. 
\v 15 Another angel came out of the temple \add in heaven\add*. In a loud voice,
\add speaking figuratively about gathering people for God to judge
them\add*, he said to the one who was sitting on the cloud, “The time has come to reap
\add the grain on the earth\add*, so with your sickle \add reap\add* the
\add grain\add*, because the grain on the earth is ripe.” 
\v 16 The one who was sitting on the cloud forcefully gathered together
\add all the people\add* on earth, \add as\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add a farmer\add* reaps grain with his sickle.
\v 17 Another angel came out of the sanctuary in heaven. He also held a sharp sickle.
\v 18 From the altar came another angel. He is the one who takes care of the fire
\add of the altar. Also speaking figuratively about gathering the wicked people for God to judge and punish
them\add*, he said in a loud voice to the angel who held the sharp sickle, “With your sharp sickle cut off the clusters of
grapes in the vineyards on the earth! Then gather the clusters of grapes together, because its grapes are ripe!”
\v 19 So, \add just like a man would\add* cut off with his sickle the clusters of grapes in his vineyard \f + \ft metaphor \f*, an angel
forcefully \add gathered the wicked people\add* on the earth. Then he threw them into the huge place where God will angrily
punish them. 
\v 20  \add The wicked people\add* were trampled on {\add God's agent\add* trod on
\add the wicked people\add*} \add in\add* the winepress outside the city. The blood that came out from the winepress flowed
\add in a stream so deep that it reached\add* to the bridles of the horses,
\add and extended\add* 180 miles\f + \ft Or: 300 kilometers \f*.
