\c 2  
\s Revelation 2:1-7 
\s Christ exhorts the congregation at Ephesus to repent and to begin again to love him and each other.
\p
\v 1  \add He also said to me\add*, "Write \add this message\add* to the leader \f + \ft metaphor \f* of the congregation in Ephesus
\add city: 'I\add* am saying these things \add to you: I am\add* the one who firmly holds the seven stars in my right hand.
\add I am\add* the one who walks among the seven golden lampstands.
\v 2 I know what you do: You labor \add for me\add* intensely, and you continue
\add to serve me\add* steadfastly. \add I know\add* that you cannot tolerate people
\add who teach what is\add* evil \f + \ft metonymy \f*, and that you investigated people who falsely claimed that they are apostles, and you
found that they were lying. 
\v 3  \add I know\add* also that you continue \add to serve me\add* steadfastly.
\add Even when people\add* \add caused you to suffer\f + \ft Or: persecuted
you\add* \f*, you continued to serve \add me\add* because \add you believe\add* in me, and you have not become too tired
\add to keep on serving me\add*. 
\v 4 Nevertheless, I have \add this complaint\add* against you: You no longer love
\add each other and me\add* as you did when you first \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add trusted in
me\add*. 
\v 5  \add So, I tell you to\add* remember how you used to love \add me and each other,
and\add* to \add realize\add* that you no longer love as you did.
\add I tell\add* you to turn away from your sin \add of not loving me and each
other\add*, and start loving \add each other and me again\add* as you did at first. If you do not turn away from your sinful
behavior, I will come \add to judge\add* you and cause your group to cease to be a Christian congregation \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\v 6 But you have the following good quality: Those Nicolaitans \add teach you believers that you can worship idols and that
you may act immorally\add*. However, you hate such teaching, just like I also hate it.
\v 7 Everyone who wants to understand my message \f + \ft metonymy \f* must listen carefully to the message that
\add God's\add* Spirit speaks to the congregations. To everyone who overcomes
\add Satan\add*, I will give the right to eat \add fruit\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* from the tree
\add that gives\add* eternal life, the tree that is in God's garden.'"
\s Revelation 2:8-11 
\s Christ exhorts the congregation at Smyrna not to fear what they will suffer, but to trust in him, even if they must die
because they trust in him. 
\p
\v 8 "Write \add this message\add* to the leader \f + \ft metaphor \f* of the congregation in Smyrna
\add city: 'I am\add* saying these things \add to you. I am\add* the one who began
\add all things\add* and \add who causes all things to\add* end. I am the one who died and became alive
\add again\add*. 
\v 9 I know that you suffer \add because of what unbelievers do to
you\add*, and that you lack \add material possessions\add*. But \add I also know
that\add* you are \add spiritually\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* rich. \add I know\add* that people slander\f + \ft Or: say evil things about \f* you. They say
that they are Jews, but I do not \add consider that they are Jews. I consider
that\add* they \add belong to\add* the assembly that Satan \add controls!\add*
\v 10 Do not be afraid of any of the things that you are about to suffer. The truth is that the devil is about to
\add put\add* some of you in prison, to tempt you \add to deny that you believe in
me\add*. For a short period of time you will suffer \add because of what people will do to
you\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*. Continue to trust in me, \add even if\add* they kill you
\add because you trust in me\add*. As a result, I will \add reward you
with\add* eternal life\add , just like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add people reward a victorious athlete by
putting\add* a wreath \add on his head\add*. 
\v 11 Everyone who wants to understand \f + \ft metonymy \f* must listen carefully to the message that
\add God's\add* Spirit speaks to the congregations. \add After\add* those who conquer
\add Satan die\add*, they will live with God. They will never suffer again, even though many others will suffer as though they
died a second time.'" 
\s Revelation 2:12-17 
\s Christ exhorts the congregation at Pergamum to stop listening to what the Nicolaitans teach.
\p
\v 12 "Write \add this message\add* to the leader \f + \ft metaphor \f* of the congregation in Pergamum
\add city: 'I am\add* saying these things \add to you. I am\add* the one who has the sharp two-edged sword.
\v 13 I know where you live: It is where Satan controls \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add people\add*.
\add I know\add* that you firmly believe in me \f + \ft metonymy \f*. You did not deny that you believe\f + \ft Or: trust \f* in me, not even in the time when
Antipas, my faithful witness\f + \ft Or: who faithfully told people about me \f*,
\add was alive\add*. He was killed {People killed him} in your city, a city where
\add people\add* habitually obey Satan. 
\v 14 Nevertheless, I have this \add complaint\add* against you: You permit some of your
\add members\add* to teach things like Balaam \add taught long ago.
He\add* taught Balak to persuade the Israelite people to sin. \add Specifically\add*, he taught them to eat food that had been
offered to idols, and to practice sexual immorality. 
\v 15 In that way, you are also permitting some of \add your members\add* to practice what the Nicolaitans teach,
\add which is like what Balaam taught\add*. 
\v 16 So you must stop doing \add this\add*. If \add you do\add* not stop doing
\add it\add*, I will come to you suddenly. With the words that I will speak I will fight against those
\add who believe this false teaching\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*, and I will \add condemn them\f + \ft Or: say that they must be
punished\add* \f*. 
\v 17 Everyone who wants to understand \f + \ft metonymy \f* must listen carefully to the message that
\add God's\add* Spirit speaks to the congregations. To everyone who conquers
\add Satan\add*, I will give \add blessings that will be like\add* the
\add food called\add* manna \add that is in a jar\add* that is {that someone has} hidden. I will also give them a white stone
on which \add I will\add* engrave a new name, a name that no one but the ones who receive it will know.'"
\s Revelation 2:18-29 
\s Christ rebukes the congregation at Thyatira for tolerating a teacher who encourages sexual immorality and eating food
offered to idols. He warns those who participate in these things that he will punish them unless they repent, and he exhorts
the rest of the members to remain loyal to him. 
\p
\v 18 "Write \add this message\add* to the leader \f + \ft metaphor \f* of the congregation in Thyatira
\add city: 'I\add*, the Son of God\f + \ft Or: the one who is also God \f*, am saying these things
\add to you: I am\add* the one whose eyes \add shine\add* \f + \ft simile \f* like a flame of fire, and whose feet
\add shine\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* like fine brass. 
\v 19 I know that you love \add me and each other\add*, and that you trust
\add in me\add*. I know that you serve \add others\add* and that you steadfastly endure
\add a lot of difficulties\f + \ft Or: trials \f*. I know\add* that you are doing these things more now than
\add you have done them\add* in the past. 
\v 20 Nevertheless, I have this \add complaint\add* against you: You tolerate that woman
\add among your members who is like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add that wicked queen\add* Jezebel
\add who lived long ago\add*. She says that she Â…is a prophetess\f + \ft Or: proclaims messages that come directly from God \f*, but by what
she teaches she is deceiving my servants. She is urging them to practice sexual immorality and to eat food that they have
offered to idols. 
\v 21 Although I gave her time to turn away from \add her sexual immorality and pagan
practices\add*, she did not want to stop \add doing them\add*. 
\v 22 Take notice \add that as a result\add*, I will cause her to become very ill \f + \ft metonymy \f*. I will also cause those
\add who act immorally as she does\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* to suffer greatly, if they do not stop
\add doing\add* what she does. 
\v 23 Some\add have become like\add* her children by accepting\add what she
teaches\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*; I will certainly get rid of them. As a result, all the congregations will recognize that I am the one who
finds out what everyone thinks and desires \f + \ft metonymy \f*. I will reward each of you according to what you have done.
\v 24 But I have something good to say about the rest \add of you
believers\add* in Thyatira. \add It is good\add* that you do not accept that
\add false\add* teaching. \add It is good that you reject\add* what those
\add teachers\add* call their 'secret \add practices,' practices
that\add* Satan \add inspired\add* \f + \ft Or: what those teachers \add facetiously\add* call the secret, profound
\add practices that\add* Satan \add inspires\add* \f*. I will not burden you with any other commands
\add than that which you already have\add*. 
\v 25 Just keep \add believing firmly in me, and obey me\add* until I come.
\v 26 As for those who conquer \add Satan\add* and who \f + \ft Or: \add because\add* they \f* keep on doing until they die what I
command, I will give them my authority, just like I myself received it from my Father.
\add They will exercise that authority\add* over the nations \add that rebel against
God\add*. 
\v 27 They will exercise authority over them \add severely as if they were striking
them\add* \f + \ft hyperbole \f* with an iron rod. They \add will destroy evildoers\add* just like
\add people\add* shatter clay pots \f + \ft metaphor \f*. 
\v 28 I will also give to \add everyone who conquers Satan a share in the glory
like\add* the morning star \add has\add* \f + \ft metonymy, metaphor \f*. 
\v 29 Everyone who wants to understand \f + \ft metonymy \f* must listen carefully to the message that
\add God's\add* Spirit speaks to the congregations.'"
