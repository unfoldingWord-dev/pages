\c 13  
\s Revelation 13:1-10 
\s A beast rose from the ocean. It received power and authority from the dragon. All people worshipped it, that is, all people
whose names were not recorded in the book of life worshipped the beast for forty-two months.
\p
\v 1 I saw a beast that was coming up out of the ocean. It had ten horns and seven heads. On each
\add of\add* its horns there was a royal crown. On \add each\add* of its heads there was a name that insulted
\add God\add*. 
\v 2 The beast that I saw was like a leopard. But its feet were like the feet of a bear, and its mouth was like the mouth of a
lion. The dragon gave the beast \add power\add*. From his own throne he also gave it authority
\add to rule people\add* \f + \ft doublet \f*. 
\v 3 One of the heads of the beast had been wounded \f + \ft Or:\add The Lord\add* had wounded one of the heads of the beast \f*, causing the
beast to almost die. But its wound was healed. \add As a result,
nearly\add* all \add the people of\add* the earth \f + \ft hyperbole, metonymy \f* marveled at the beast and became his disciples.
\v 4 They worshipped the dragon, because he had given to the beast authority
\add to rule people\add*. They also worshipped the beast, saying, "No one is
\add as powerful\add* as the beast!\f + \ft Or: Who is \add as powerful\add* as the beast? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* No one would dare to fight against
it!\f + \ft Or: Who would dare to fight against it? \f*" \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* 
\v 5 The beast was allowed \f + \ft Or:\add God\add* allowed the beast \f* to speak \f + \ft metonymy \f* proudly and to insult
\add God\add*. \add It was also\add* allowed \f + \ft Or:\add God\add* also allowed it \f* to exercise authority
\add over people\add* for forty-two months. 
\v 6 It spoke \f + \ft metonymy \f* in order to insult God, in order to insult his name, in order to insult the place where he lives, and in
order to insult the people who live there in heaven. 
\v 7  \add It was\add* allowed \f + \ft Or:\add God\add* allowed it \f* to fight against God's people and to conquer them.
\add It was\add* allowed \f + \ft Or:\add God\add* allowed it \f* to have authority
\add to rule\add* over every tribe, over every people-\add group\add*, over
\add speakers of\add* every language \f + \ft metonymy \f*, and over every nation.
\v 8 Most of \f + \ft hyperbole \f* the \add people\add* living on earth worshipped it. They were people whose names were not written in a book
by the \add one who is like a\add* lamb, the one who had been killed. Since the beginning of the world
\add he wrote in it the names of the people who\add* will have \add eternal\add* life.
\v 9 Everyone who wants to understand \f + \ft metonymy \f* must listen carefully to
\add this message from God\add*: 
\v 10 If \add God has determined\add* that some people will be captured by their
\add enemies\add*, they will be captured. If \add God has determined
that\add* some people will be killed with a sword, they will be killed with the sword. So God's people
\add must be\add* steadfast, and be faithful \add to him\add*. 
\s Revelation 13:11-18 
\s Another beast appeared, having the same authority to rule people that the first beast had, and it caused people on earth to
worship the first beast. People made an image of the first beast, and the beast had everyone killed who refused to worship the
image. It caused all people to be marked with the name of the first beast. The number of the beast's name is 666.
\p
\v 11 I saw another beast, which was coming up from the earth. It had two small horns
\add on its head\add* like a sheep has. But it spoke \add things to deceive
people\add*, like the dragon does. 
\v 12 While the first beast watched, it used all the \add same\add* authority
\add to rule people that the first beast had\add*. It forced the people who live on the earth \f + \ft metonymy, doublet \f* to worship the first
beast, that is, the one who was healed of the wound that had caused it to almost die.
\v 13 The second beast performed awesome miracles, even causing fire from the sky to fall to earth while people watched.
\v 14 He performed miracles on behalf of\f + \ft Or: with the authority of \f* the
\add first\add* beast. By doing that he deceived the \add unbelieving\add* people on the earth so that they
\add believed that they should worship the first beast. But this happened only because
God\add* allowed \add it to happen\add*. The second beast told the people living on earth to make an image of the
\add first\add* beast, the one that \add people\add* had killed with a sword and that then came back to life again.
\v 15 The image of the \add first\add* beast was allowed to breathe, in order that it might speak and in order that
\add it might command that\add* whoever refused to worship its image should be killed \f + \ft Or:that
\add people\add* should kill whoever refused to worship its image \f*.
\v 16  \add The second beast\add* required also that \add the first beast's
name\add* be marked \f + \ft Or:\add its agents\add* mark\add the first beast's
name\add* \f* on the right hand or on the forehead of everyone, those of little
\add social importance\add* and of great \add social importance\add*, the rich and the poor, free
\add people\add* and slaves. \add Everyone!\add* 
\v 17 They did this in order that people could not buy \add anything\add* or sell
\add anything\add* if they did not have the mark, which represents the name of the beast or the number of its name,
\add on their foreheads\add*. 
\v 18 You must \add think\add* wisely to understand \add the meaning of the
mark\add*. Anyone who thinks wisely should calculate from the number of the beast what the man's name is. That number is six
hundred and sixty-six.
