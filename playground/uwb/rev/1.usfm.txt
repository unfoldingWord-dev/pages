\v 1  \add This book tells the message\add* that God revealed to Jesus Christ. God revealed it to him in order that he might
reveal to his servants the \add things\f + \ft Or: events \f*\add* that must happen soon. Jesus communicated
\add this message\add* to \add me\add*, his servant John, by sending his angel to me.
\v 2  \add As I write it, I\add*, John, am truthfully reporting everything that I saw
\add and heard\add*, the message from God that Jesus Christ\add truthfully reported to
me\add*. 
\v 3  \add God is\add* pleased with those who read \add this book to the
congregation\add*, and he will be pleased with those who listen carefully to it and obey what
\add he has commanded by means of\add* this prophetic message that
\add I\add* am writing. \add So read this message, listen carefully to it, and obey
it\add*, because \add these things that Jesus has revealed\add* will happen soon.
\s Revelation 1:4-8 
\s John said that he was writing to believers in the seven congregations in Asia. He prayed that God would bless them. He said
that Christ is coming to judge rebellious people and to bring in his kingdom.
\p
\v 4  \add I\add*, John, am \add writing this\add* to \add you believers
in\add* the seven congregations \add that are located\add* in Asia
\add province\add*. \add I pray that God the Father, God's Spirit, and Jesus
Christ\add* may act kindly toward \f + \ft Or: bless) you and cause you to have
\add inner\add* peace. \add God the Father is\add* the one who exists, who has always existed, and who will always exist. The
Spirit \add of God, who\add* is in front of God's throne, has \add all kinds of
power\add* (OR, The Spirit of God\add is symbolized\add* by seven spirits who are in front of God's throne).
\v 5 Jesus Christ is the one who has faithfully told \add people about
God\add*. He is the first one whom God has raised from the dead\f + \ft Or: who became alive again after being dead \f*, in order
\add to show that he will raise us who trust him\add*. He is the one who rules the kings of the earth. He is the one who loves
us. He is the one who has canceled the guilt for our sins. He did that by the
blood\add which flowed from his body when he died on the cross\add*.
\v 6 He is \add the one who\add* has caused us to become people over whose lives God rules, and he has made us to be priests
\add who serve his\add* God and Father. \add As a result of this, we acknowledge
that\add* Jesus Christ is eternally divine and eternally powerful. Amen!\f + \ft Or: That is true! \f*
\p
\v 7 Listen carefully! Christ will surely come in the midst of the clouds
\add in order that he may judge the rebellious people of earth\add*, and everyone \f + \ft synecdoche \f* will see him
\add come\add*. Even those who \add are responsible for\add* piercing
\add and killing\add* him \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add will see him come. People from\add* all people-groups on earth will mourn because he
\add will punish them\add*. Amen!\f + \ft Or: May it be so. \f* 
\v 8 The Lord God declares, “I am the one who began \add all things\add*, and I am the
\add one who will cause all things to\add* end \f + \ft metaphor \f*.” He is the one who exists, who has always existed, and who will always
exist. He is the Almighty One. 
\s Revelation 1:9-20 
\s Christ appeared to John and commissioned him to write down the vision that he was about to give him and to send it to the
seven congregations in Asia. 
\p
\v 9 I, John, your fellow believer, am suffering as you \add are\add* because of our letting Jesus rule
\add our lives\add*. We are steadfastly enduring \add trials\add* because of our relationship with him. I was punished by being
sent\f + \ft Or: exiled \f* to the island that is called {that \add people\add* call} Patmos because
\add of my proclaiming\add* God's message and telling \add people
about\add* Jesus. 
\v 10  \add God's\add* Spirit took control of me on one of the days
\add that we believers met to worship\add* the Lord. 
\v 11  \add At that time\add*, I heard behind me someone \add speaking to me as loudly and as
clearly\add* \f + \ft simile \f* as a trumpet. He was saying \add to me\add*, “Write on a scroll what you see, and send it to seven
congregations. Send it to \add the congregations\add* in Ephesus
\add city\add*, in Smyrna \add city\add*, in Pergamum \add city\add*, in Thyatira
\add city\add*, in Sardis \add city\add*, in Philadelphia \add city\add*, and in Laodicea
\add city\add*.” 
\v 12  \add In this vision\add* I turned in order that I might see who had spoken to me \f + \ft synecdoche \f*. When I turned,
\v 13 I saw seven golden lampstands. In the midst of the lampstands there was
\add someone\add* who looked like one who came from heaven. He wore a robe that reached to his feet, and he wore a gold band
around his chest. 
\v 14 The hair on his head was white like white wool \add or\add* like snow. His eyes were
\add shining brightly\add* \f + \ft simile \f*, like a flame of fire. 
\v 15 His feet \add looked\add* like brass that glows \add as it is
being\add* purified {as \add people\add* purify it} in a furnace.
\add When he spoke\add*, his voice \add sounded\add* like the sound
\add made by\add* a huge waterfall (OR, a great\f + \ft Or: wide \f* river of rushing water \f*.
\v 16 In his right hand he held seven stars. A sword that had two sharp edges extended from his mouth. His face
\add shone as bright\add* as the sun shines \add at midday\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*.
\v 17 When I saw him, I fell down at his feet \add and was unable to move or
speak\add* \f + \ft simile \f*, as though \add I were\add* dead. But he put his right hand on me and said to me, “Stop being afraid! I am the
one who began \add all things\add* and the \add one who causes all things
to\add* end. 
\v 18 I am the one who always lives. Although I died, I am alive and will live forever! I have
\add the power to cause people\add* to die, and I have authority over the place where all the dead people
\add are\add*. 
\v 19 So write the \add vision\add* that you are seeing. Write about the
\add conditions\add* that exist now, and the \add events\add* that are about to happen afterward.
\v 20 The meaning of the seven stars that you saw in my right hand and of the seven golden lampstands
\add that you saw is this\add*: The seven stars \add in my hand represent the leaders, who are
like\add* angels, \add who watch over\add* the seven congregations, and the
\add seven\add* lampstands \add represent\add* the seven congregations.”
