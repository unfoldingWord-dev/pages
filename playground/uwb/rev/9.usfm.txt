\c 9  
\s Revelation 9:1-12 
\s When the fifth angel blew his trumpet, locusts with stings like scorpions came on the earth and attacked the rebellious
people. 
\p
\v 1 The fifth angel blew his trumpet. Then I saw \add an evil angel. He was
like\add* a star that had fallen from the sky to the earth. He was given
\f + \ft Or:\add Someone\add* gave him \f* the key to the shaft \add that descended\add*
\add to\add* the underworld\f + \ft Or: \add to\add* the deep dark pit \f*. 
\v 2 When he opened that shaft, smoke arose from it like smoke from a great burning furnace. The smoke prevented
\add anyone from seeing the light of\add* the sun and the sky. 
\v 3 Locusts came out of the smoke onto the earth. \add They were
given\add* \f + \ft Or:\add God\add* gave them \f* power \add to sting people\add*, like scorpions
\add sting people\add*. 
\v 4  \add God\add* told the locusts that they should not harm the grass of the earth, nor any plants, nor any tree.
\add God said that they should harm only\add* those people who did not have a mark on the forehead
\add to show that they belonged to God\add*. 
\v 5  \add God\add* did not allow the locusts to kill those people. Instead,
\add he\add* allowed them to continue torturing people for five months. When they tortured people, the pain those people felt
was like the pain a scorpion causes when it stings someone. 
\v 6 During the time \add when the locusts torture rebellious people, the pain will be so bad
that\add* people will want to find a way to die, but they will not find \f + \ft personification \f* any way. They will long to die, but they will not
be able to die \f + \ft personification \f*. 
\v 7 The locusts looked like horses that are ready for battle. They had on their heads what looked like golden crowns. Their
faces were like the faces of people. 
\v 8 They had \add long\add* hair like the \add long\add* hair of women. Their teeth were
\add strong\add*, like lions' teeth. 
\v 9 They wore metal breastplates. \add When they were flying\add*, their wings made a noise like a roar when many horses
\add pull chariots as they are\add* rushing into battle. 
\v 10 They had tails like \add tails of\add* scorpions \add by which
they\add* stung \add people\add*. Their power to harm people during those five months was in their tails.
\v 11 The king who ruled over them was the angel of the underworld. His name in the Hebrew language is Abaddon. In the Greek
language it is Apollyon. \add Both of\add* those names \add mean
'Destroyer'\add*. 
\p
\v 12 That ended the first terrible event. \add Be aware that\add* two tragic events are still to come.
\s Revelation 9:13-21 
\s When the sixth angel blew his trumpet, a third of the rebellious people on earth died. But the rest of the rebels did not
repent of their false worship or of their evil practices. 
\p
\v 13 The sixth angel blew his trumpet. Then I heard a voice from the four corners of the golden altar that is in God's
presence. 
\v 14 It was saying to the sixth angel, the one who had the trumpet, "Release the four angels whom
\add I\add* have bound at the great river Euphrates." 
\v 15 The four angels were released, those who had been \f + \ft Or:\add He\add* released the four angels, whom
\add God\add* had \f* kept ready for that \add exact\add* hour of that day, of that month, of that year. They were released
\f + \ft Or:\add He\add* released them \f* in order that they might enable \add their soldiers
to\add* kill a third of the \add rebellious\add* people. 
\v 16 The number of the soldiers riding on horses that did that was two hundred million. I heard
\add someone say\add* how many there were. 
\v 17 In the vision I saw what the horses and the \add beings\add* that rode them looked like. They
\add wore\add* breastplates that were \add red\add* like fire, \add dusky
blue\add* like smoke, and \add yellow\add* like sulfur. The heads of the horses were like the heads of lions. From their mouths
came fire, smoke, and \add fumes of burning\add* sulfur. 
\v 18 Those three things—the fire, the smoke, and the \add burning\add* sulfur from
\add the horses'\add* mouths—killed a third of the \add rebellious\add* people.
\v 19 The power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails. Their tails have heads like snakes by which they harm
people. 
\v 20 The rest of the \add rebellious\add* people, those who were not killed by these plagues of
\add fire and smoke and burning sulfur\add*, did not turn from their sinful behavior.
\add They did not stop worshipping\add* the idols that they had made with their own hands. They did not stop worshipping demons
and idols \add that were made\add* of gold, of silver, of bronze, of stone, and of wood,
\add even though they are idols\add* that can neither see nor hear nor walk.
\v 21 They did not stop murdering people, or practicing sorcery, or acting in sexually immoral ways, or stealing
\add things\add*.
