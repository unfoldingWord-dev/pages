\c 3  
\s Revelation 3:1-6 
\s Christ exhorts the congregation at Sardis to wake up and repent. But the members who are worthy will live with him.
\p
\v 1 "Write \add this message\add* to the leader \f + \ft metaphor \f* of the congregation in Sardis
\add city\add*: 'I am saying these things \add to you. I am\add* the one who can give
\add to people\add* all the power of God's Spirit \f + \ft Or: in whom is the Spirit of God who has all kinds of power; OR,
\add who has God's Spirit, who is symbolized as\add* seven spirits \f*, and
\add I am the one\add* who has the seven stars. I know everything that you have done.
You\add \f + \ft plural \f*\add* appear to be alive \add spiritually\add*, but\add you are so weak spiritually it is as
though\add* you are dead \f + \ft metaphor \f*. 
\v 2  \add Become aware of your spiritual need as though you were\add* awaking
\add from sleep\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, and strengthen \add yourself spiritually, because you are so useless that you are like someone who
is\add* about to die \f + \ft metaphor \f*. \add You must do this\add* because I know that my God considers that nothing that you do is
satisfactory. 
\v 3 So then, keep remembering \add God's message, what\add* you accepted when you heard it. Obey it continually, and turn away
from your sinful behavior. If \add you do not become aware of your spiritual need and turn away from
your\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add sinful behavior\add*, I will come to you \add when you are not expecting
me\add*, as a thief \add comes\add* \f + \ft simile \f*. You will never know at what time I will come to
\add judge\add* you. 
\v 4 Nevertheless, \add there\add* in Sardis you have a few members who
\add have not been doing what is wrong. It is as though they\add* have not soiled their garments \f + \ft metaphor \f*. As a result, because
they are worthy \add to live with me\add*, they will live with me
\add and will be pure in every way\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add like people who are
dressed\add* in \add pure\add* white \add clothing\add*. 
\v 5 Everyone who conquers \add Satan\add* I will dress in these same white garments \f + \ft metaphor \f* \f + \ft Or: will be
\add pure in every way as though they are\add* dressed in these white garments \f*, and I will never erase their names from the
book \add that contains the names of the people who have eternal\add* life. Instead, as my Father and his angels are listening,
I will acknowledge that they \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add belong to me\add*. 
\v 6 Everyone who wants to understand \f + \ft metonymy \f* must listen carefully to the message that
\add God's\add* Spirit speaks to the congregations.'" 
\s Revelation 3:7-13 
\s Christ exhorts the congregation at Philadelphia to continue to obey his word and to be faithful; he promises that some Jews
will acknowledge that he loves the congregation, and he also promises that he will keep the congregation from spiritual harm
during the period of testing. 
\p
\v 7 "Write \add this message\add* to the leader \f + \ft metaphor \f* of the congregation in Philadelphia
\add city\add*: 'I am saying these things\add to you. I am\add* God's Holy One, the True One.
\add Just like King\add* David had authority \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add to allow people to enter the ancient city of Jerusalem, so I have the
authority to allow people to enter\add* my kingdom\add . I am\add* the one who opens
\add doors\add* so that no one can close them, and who closes doors so that no one can open them.
\v 8 I know everything you have done. Be aware that I have opened before you a door that no one can close.
\add I know that although\add* you do not have \add many believers\add* \f + \ft Or: much
\add spiritual\add* strength \f* \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add in your congregation\add*, you have obeyed what I say, and you have not denied
\add that you believe in\add* me \f + \ft metonymy \f*. 
\v 9  \add I am aware that\add* some of your people meet together with those who
\add follow\f + \ft Or: worship \f*\add* Satan. They claim to be Jews, but I know that they are not true Jews. They are lying. I will cause
them to come to you and to bow down \add humbly\add* at your feet and to acknowledge that I love you.
\p
\v 10 Because you have paid attention to the message to endure patiently
\add when you suffered\add*, I will keep you \add safe from those who will try to harm you
spiritually\add* during the period\f + \ft Or: time \f* that is about to come. At that time
\add God will cause rebellious people\add* on the earth to suffer, in order that I can determine
\add whether they will turn away from their sins or not\add*. 
\v 11 I am coming soon. \add So\add* continue to hold fast to\f + \ft Or: to believe firmly \f* the
\add message\add* that you have received, in order that no one may cause you to lose the reward
\add that God has reserved for\add* you. 
\v 12 I will make everyone who conquers \add Satan secure\add*. They will be
\add firm like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* the pillars in the temple of my God, and they will remain there forever. I will mark them with the
name of my God, \add showing that they belong to him. I will also mark
them\add* with the name of the city of my God, \add showing that they will live there. That city
is\add* the New Jerusalem, the city that will descend out of heaven from my God.
\add I will also mark them\add* with my new name, \add showing that they belong to
me\add*. 
\v 13 Everyone who wants to understand \f + \ft metonymy \f* must listen carefully to the message that
\add God's\add* Spirit speaks to the congregations.'" 
\s Revelation 3:14-22 
\s Christ exhorts the congregation at Laodicea to repent of their neglect of fellowship with him and of their failure to accept
his provision for their spiritual needs. He waits to restore fellowship with any member of the congregation who will respond to
his call. 
\p
\v 14 "Write \add this message\add* to the leader \f + \ft metaphor \f* of the congregation in Laodicea
\add city: 'I\add* am saying these things \add to you. I am\add* the one who guarantees
\add all of God's promises\f + \ft Or: \add*confirms that\add God\add* will do\add all that he has
promised\add* \f* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. I am the one who testifies \add about God\add* reliably and accurately. I am the one by whom God created
\add all things\add*. 
\v 15 I know everything that you have done: You \add neither deny that you trust in me nor love\f + \ft Or: obey \f* me
zealously\f + \ft Or: wholeheartedly \f*. You are like water that is\add* neither cold nor hot. I wish that you were either cold or hot!
\v 16 Because you are neither enthusiastic about me nor concerned about your lack of spiritual growth \f + \ft metaphor \f*, I am about to
\add reject\add* you \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add as if\add* I were spitting \add lukewarm
water\add* out of my mouth. 
\v 17 You are saying, '\add Because we have all that we need spiritually\add*, we are
\add like\add* rich \add people who\add* have acquired a lot of wealth. We lack nothing!' But you do not realize that you are
\add lacking in so many ways spiritually that you are like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* people who are very wretched and pitiful, poor, blind,
and naked. 
\v 18 I advise you \add to obtain from me all that you need spiritually, as though you
were\add* buying from me gold that has been refined by fire \f + \ft Or:that fire has refined \f*, in order that you may be
\add truly\add* rich \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add spiritually. Let me make you righteous, as though you
were\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* buying from me white garments in order that you might wear clothes instead of being naked and ashamed.
\add Let me help you to perceive spiritual things, as though\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* you were buying from me eye salve in order to anoint
your eyes in order that you might see. 
\v 19  \add Since\add* I rebuke and correct all those whom I affectionately love, earnestly turn away from your sinful
behavior. 
\v 20 Be aware that \add I call each one of you to respond to me\add* as though \f + \ft metaphor \f* I
\add was\add* standing \add waiting\add* at \add your\add* door and knocking. I will come to all those who hear my voice and
respond to me, and I \add will fellowship\add* with them \add as friends do when
they\add* eat together \f + \ft metaphor \f*. 
\v 21 I will permit everyone who conquers \add Satan\add* to sit
\add and rule\add* with me on my throne, just like I conquered \add Satan\add* and now sit
\add and rule\add* with my Father on his throne. 
\v 22 Everyone who wants to understand \f + \ft metonymy \f* must listen carefully to the message that
\add God's\add* Spirit speaks to the congregations.'"
