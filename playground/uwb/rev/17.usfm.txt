\c 17  
\s Revelation 17:1-2 
\s One of the seven angels offered to show John how God will punish the very evil city represented by a prostitute, with whom
the rulers of people on earth have been seduced to act immorally and idolatrously.
\p
\v 1 One of the seven angels, who had \add one of\add* the seven bowls, came to me. He said to me, "Come
\add with me\add* and I will show you how \add God\add* will punish the very evil
\add city that is represented by\add* \f + \ft symbol \f* a prostitute, a city in which there are many
canals\add of\add* water. 
\v 2  \add It is as though\add* the rulers of earth have acted immorally
\add and idolatrously\add* with the people of that city \f + \ft metaphor \f*, and they
\add have persuaded people\add* who live on the earth to act immorally
\add and idolatrously\add* with them \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add just like a prostitute persuades men to
drink\add* the \add strong\add* wine \add she gives them, resulting in
their\add* becoming drunk\add and\add* committing immorality." 
\s Revelation 17:3-6 
\s When the angel took John to a wilderness, he saw an immoral woman who was drunk with the blood of God's people. The sight
caused John to react with great bewilderment. 
\p
\v 3 Then, as \add God's\add* Spirit \add controlled me\add*, the angel carried me away to a desolate area. There I saw a woman
who was sitting on a red beast. The beast had \add written\add* names all over itself. They were names that insulted\f + \ft Or: spoke
evil against \f* \add God\add*. It had seven heads and ten horns. 
\v 4 The woman \add that I saw\add* was wearing purple and red \add clothes\add*; and gold, precious stones, and pearls were
fastened to her \add clothes and her body\add*. She held in her hand a golden cup. The cup was full of
\add a liquid that represents\add* \f + \ft symbol \f* the detestable\f + \ft Or: disgusting \f*, idolatrous things and filthy immoral things that she
\add does\add*. 
\v 5 This name, that has a hidden\f + \ft Or: secret \f* \add meaning\add*, was written on her
forehead\add :\add* "\add This woman is\add* Babylon, the very evil
\add city! She acts like\add* the mother of the prostitutes on the earth. She teaches them to
\add act\add* immorally and to worship idols." 
\v 6 I saw that the woman had become drunk as a result of drinking the blood of God's people, those who had told others about
Jesus. When I saw her, I was very bewildered\f + \ft Or: perplexed \f*. 
\s Revelation 17:7-18 
\s The angel revealed the meaning of what John had seen, identifying as ruling entities both the beast which amazed people and
his seven heads and ten horns, and the angel declared that they would be overcome by the Lamb and defeated. The angel
identified the prostitute as representing the very evil city that dominates people, and he declared that it would be destroyed.
\p
\v 7 The angel said to me, "Do not be bewildered!\f + \ft Or: Why \f* are you bewildered \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*? I will explain to you the hidden\f + \ft Or: secret \f* meaning
of the woman and of the beast on which she rides, the beast that has the seven heads and the ten horns.
\v 8 The beast that you saw \add lived\add* previously. Eventually God will destroy him, but now he is dead. He is
\add about to\add* come up from the underworld\f + \ft Or: from the deep dark pit \f*.
\add When\add* the beast who had previously lived, and who then had died, reappears, the people who live on the earth will be
amazed. \add They are people whose\add* names were not in the book in which are written the names of people
\add who will\add* have eternal life\add . The angels have been writing those names in a
list\add* from the beginning of the world\f + \ft Or: from the time when the world began \f*.
\v 9 Those who \add think\add* wisely \add can understand\add* this: The seven heads
\add of the beast\add* on which the woman sits \add symbolize\add* the seven hills
\add of the city that the woman represents\add*. They also \add symbolize\add* seven rulers.
\v 10 Five \add of those rulers\add* have died. One is \add still
alive\add*. The seventh \add ruler\add* has not yet come. When he comes, he must remain for
\add only\add* a short \add time\add*. 
\v 11 The beast that \add lived\add* before and then was not \add alive\add* will be the eighth
\add ruler\add*. He will be \add evil like\add* the seven \add rulers were, but
God\add* will surely destroy him. 
\v 12 The ten horns that you saw \add represent\add* ten rulers who have not yet begun to rule. They will receive authority in
order to rule \add people\add* together with the beast \add for only a short time, as if it
were\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* for one hour. 
\v 13 Those \add rulers\add* will all agree to do the same thing.
\add As a result\add* they will give to the beast their right \add to rule
people\add* and their authority \add to rule people\add* \f + \ft doublet \f*. 
\v 14 The rulers and the beast will fight against \add Jesus\add*, the
\add one who is like a\add* lamb. He will defeat them, because he is Lord
\add who rules over all other\add* lords and the King \add who rules over all
other\add* kings. Those \add people\add* who are with him \add and helping
him\add* are the ones whom \add God\add* has chosen, and who keep
\add serving him\add* faithfully." 
\v 15 Then the angel said to me, "The waters that you saw in the city where the prostitute sits represent
people-\add groups\add*, multitudes \add of people\add*, nations, and
\add speakers of many languages\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*. 
\v 16 The ten horns that you saw \add represent rulers\add* \f + \ft symbol \f*. They and the beast will hate
\add the people in the city\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* that the prostitute \add represents\add*. As a result, they will
\add take away everything that is in the city, as if\add* they were \f + \ft metaphor \f* leaving it naked. They will
\add destroy it as if\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* devouring flesh\f + \ft Or: meat \f*, and they will burn it with fire.
\v 17 They will do that because God has caused them to decide to do what he wants them to do. As a result, they will let the
beast have their power to rule until what God has said is fulfilled \f + \ft Or:until
\add they\add* fulfill what God has said \f* \f + \ft metonymy \f*. 
\v 18 The prostitute that you saw \add represents\add* the very evil city
\add whose leaders\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* rule over the kings of the earth."
