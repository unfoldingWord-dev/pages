\c 19  
\s Revelation 19:1-8 
\s After the destruction of Babylon, John heard a huge crowd praising God for saving his people and announcing the marriage of
the one who is like a lamb. 
\p
\v 1 After these things I heard \add what sounded\add* like a huge crowd in heaven. They were shouting things like,
\q “◄Hallelujah!\f + \ft Or: Praise \f* our God!►” “He has saved us!” 
\q “He is glorious and mighty!” 
\q
\v 2 “Praise him because he judges truly and justly!” 
\q “He has punished the very evil cities that are like a prostitute,
\q because their people persuaded the other people of earth \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* to act immorally and idolatrously like they do.”
\q “Praise him because he has punished them for murdering his servants \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f*!”
\q
\v 3  \add The crowd\add* shouted a second time saying: 
\q ◄Hallelujah!\f + \ft Or: Praise \f* God!► The smoke of the fire that is burning the cities will rise forever!
\q
\v 4 The twenty-four elders and the four living \add creatures\add* ◄prostrated themselves\f + \ft Or: knelt \f* down► and worshipped God, who
sits on the throne. Then they said, “\add It\add* is true! ◄Hallelujah!\f + \ft Or: Praise \f* God!►”
\v 5 Someone spoke from the throne and said, “All you who are his servants, praise our God! All you who reverence him,
\add whether you are socially\add* significant or insignificant, praise him!
\add Everyone!\add*” 
\v 6 I heard something like the noise of a huge crowd \add of people\add*, like the sound of a huge waterfall \f + \ft (OR, a great\f + \ft Or: wide \f*
river of rushing water), and like the sound of loud thunder. They were shouting:
\q ◄Hallelujah!\f + \ft Or: Praise \f* God!► Because the Lord God, the Almighty One, reigns!
\q
\v 7 We should rejoice, we should be extremely glad, and we should honor him,
\q because it is now time for Jesus, the one who is like a lamb, to be united
\q permanently with his people, which will be like a man \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* marrying his bride, and
\q because those who belong to him have prepared themselves to be united with him.
\q
\v 8 God has permitted them to be completely pure, like a bride who \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* dresses in fine linen that is bright and clean.
\p Fine \add bright and clean\add* linen represents the righteous acts of God's people.
\s Revelation 19:9-10 
\s God will abundantly bless the people who have been invited to celebrate the marriage of the Lamb. Only God should be
worshipped. All his servants are on an equal basis. 
\p
\v 9 Then the angel said to me, “Write \add this: God will abundantly\add* bless the people who are {whom
\add he\add* has} invited to the feast \add that celebrates Jesus, the one who is like
a\add* lamb, \add permanently uniting with his people, like someone\add* \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f*
\add marrying a wife\add*.” He also said \add to me\add*: “These words that God
\add declares\add* are true!” 
\v 10 I \add immediately\add* ◄prostrated myself\f + \ft Or: knelt \f* down► at his feet in order to worship him. But he said to me, “Do not
\add worship me!\add* I am \add just\add* your\add (sg)\add* fellow servant and the fellow servant of
your\add (sg)\add* fellow believers who tell people about Jesus. God is the one whom you should worship, because it is the
Spirit of God who gives people the power to tell others about Jesus (OR,
\add those who tell others about\add* Jesus are \add truly\add* declaring
\add the words that the Spirit of God has given them\add*) \f*!” 
\s Revelation 19:11-16 
\s John saw heaven open and saw the one whom he described as King of kings and Lord of lords mounted on a white horse.
\p
\v 11 I saw heaven opened {open}, and I was surprised to see a white horse.
\add Jesus\add*, the one who was riding on the horse, is called ‘Trustworthy and Genuine\f + \ft Or: True \f*.’ He judges
\add all people according to\add* what is right, and fights righteously
\add against his enemies\add*. 
\v 12 His eyes \add shone like\add* \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* a flame of fire. There were many royal crowns on his head. A name had been written
\add on him\add*. Only he knows \add the meaning of that name\add*.
\v 13 The cloak he was wearing was drenched with blood. His name is
\add also\add* “◄The one who expresses what God is like\f + \ft Or: The \f* Word of God►.”
\v 14 The armies of heaven were following him. \add They were\add* riding on white horses. They were wearing clothes
\add made of\add* clean white linen. 
\v 15  \add The words\add* that he speaks \add are like\add* \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* a sharp sword with which he will strike
\add the rebellious people of\add* the nations. He himself will rule them
\add powerfully, as though he had\add* \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* an iron rod. He will crush
\add his enemies just like\add* \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* \add a person crushes grapes in
a\add* winepress. \add He will do this for\add* God Almighty, who is furiously angry
\add with them because of their sins\add*. 
\v 16 On his cloak close to his thigh a name had been written {\add he\add* had written a name}, which is “King who
\add rules over all other\add* kings and Lord who \add rules over all
other\add* lords.” 
\s Revelation 19:17-21 
\s An angel invited all flesh-eating birds to feast on the flesh of people who would be killed by the Rider on the white horse.
When the beast and the false prophet gathered kings with their armies against the Rider and his army, the beast and the false
prophet were thrown into the lake of fire. The sword of the Rider killed rebellious people, and the birds gorged themselves on
their flesh. 
\p
\v 17 I saw an angel who was standing in \add the light of\add* \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* the sun. He called loudly to all the
\add flesh-eating\add* birds flying high in the sky, “Come and gather for the great feast that God
\add is providing for you!\add* 
\v 18  \add Come\add* and eat the flesh of all \add God's enemies who are
dead—\add* the flesh of kings, of army commanders, of \add people who
fought\add* powerfully, of horses and of the \add soldiers\add* who rode them,
\add and the flesh of all other kinds of people\add*, whether \add they
were\add* free or slave, \add socially\add* insignificant or significant.
\add All kinds\add*!” 
\v 19 Then I saw the beast and the kings of earth with their armies gathered together to fight against the rider on the horse,
and against his army. 
\v 20 The beast and the false prophet were captured {\add He\add* captured the beast and the false prophet}. The false prophet
is the one who had performed miracles in the beast's presence. By doing that he had deceived the people who had accepted the
beast's mark \add on their foreheads\add* and who worshipped its image. The beast and the false prophet were thrown
{\add He\add* threw the beast and the one who falsely said that he spoke messages that came directly from God} alive into the
lake of fire that burns with sulfur. 
\v 21 The rider on the horse killed the rest \add of their armies\add* by
\add his words\add*, \add which were like\add* \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* a sword that extended from his mouth. All those birds gorged themselves on
the flesh of \add the people whom he had killed\add*.
