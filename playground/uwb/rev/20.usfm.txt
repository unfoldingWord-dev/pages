\c 20  
\s Revelation 20:1-3 
\s John saw an angel coming down from heaven. He seized, bound, and imprisoned the dragon for a thousand years.
\p
\v 1 I saw an angel coming down from heaven. He had the key to the deep dark pit, and he was carrying a large chain in his
hand. 
\v 2 He seized the dragon. That dragon is the ancient serpent, the devil, that is, Satan. The angel bound him with the chain.
That chain could not be loosed {\add No one could loose\add* that chain} for a thousand years.
\v 3 The angel threw him into the deep dark pit. He shut \add the door of the
pit\add*, locked it, and sealed it \add to prevent anyone from opening
it\add*. He did that in order that Satan might no longer deceive
\add the people of the\add* nations \f + \ft metonymy \f*, until those thousand years are ended. After that
\add time\add*, Satan must be released {\add God\f + \ft Or: God \f*'s angel\add* must release Satan} for a short time
\add in order that he can do what God has planned\add*. 
\s Revelation 20:4-6 
\s John saw the thrones of the martyrs who lived again and had authority to judge people. Those martyrs are the first people
whom God will cause to live again. They will reign with Christ during the thousand years.
\p
\v 4 I saw thrones on which people were sitting. \add They were given\add*
{\add God\add* gave those people} \add authority\add* to judge \add other
people\add*. I also saw the souls \add of people\add* whose heads had been {whose heads
\add others\add* had} cut off because of \add their telling people
about\add* Jesus and declaring God's message. They were people who refused to worship the beast or its image, and who did not
allow \add the beast's agents\add* to put the beast's mark on them, either on their foreheads or on their hands. They became
alive again, and they ruled with Christ \add during those\add* thousand years.
\v 5 They were the ones who lived again the first time \add that God caused dead
people\add* to live again. The rest of \add the believers who\add* had died did not live again until after those thousand
years. 
\v 6 \add God\add* will be pleased with\f + \ft Or: \add How\add* happy will be \f* those who live again this first time. God will
\add consider\add* them holy. They will not die \f + \ft personification \f* a second time. Instead, they will be priests
\add who serve\add* God and Christ, and they will rule with \add Christ\add* during those thousand years.
\s Revelation 20:7-15 
\s When Satan is released, he will deceive the nations in order to assemble them to fight against God and his people. God will
send fire to burn up the rebellious nations. He will cause Satan to be thrown into the lake of fire for everlasting punishment.
\p
\v 7 When the thousand years are ended, Satan will be released {\add God's
angel\add* will release Satan} from his prison. 
\v 8 He will go out to deceive the \add rebellious\add* people in nations \f + \ft idiom \f* all over the earth.
\add These are the nations that the prophet Ezekiel called\add* Gog and Magog. Satan will gather them to fight against
\add God's people\add*. There will be \add so many of them fighting against God's people that no one will be able to count
them\add* \f + \ft simile \f*, just like \add no one can count the grains of\add* sand on the ocean shore.
\v 9 They will march over the whole earth and will surround the camp of God's people
\add in Jerusalem\add*, the city that \add God\add* loves. Then \add God will
send\add* fire down from heaven, and it will burn them up. 
\v 10 The devil, who had deceived those people, will be thrown {\add God's
angel\add* will throw the devil, who had deceived those people} into the lake of burning sulfur.
\add This is the same lake\add* into which both the beast and the false prophet had been
\add thrown\add* {\add he\add* had \add thrown\add* both the beast and the false prophet}.
\add As a result\add*, they will continually suffer severely forever.
\p
\v 11 Then I saw a huge white throne on which \add God\add* was sitting. He
\add was so awesome that\add* the earth and the sky disappeared from his presence completely; they were completely destroyed
{\add God\add* completely destroyed them}. 
\v 12 I saw that the people who had died \add but now lived again\add* were standing in front of the throne.
\add They included people of\add* every social status! The books
\add in which God records what people do\add* were opened {\add God\f + \ft Or: God \f*'s
angel\add* opened the books \add in which God records what people
do\add*}. Another book was opened {\add He\add* opened another book}, which is
\add called the Book\add* of Life, \add in which God has written the names of people who have eternal
life\add*. \add God\add* judged the people who had died \add and now lived
again\add* according to what they had done, just like \add he\add* had recorded it in the books.
\v 13  \add The people whose bodies were buried in the\add* sea \add became alive again in order to stand before God's
throne\add*. Everyone who had been buried on the land \f + \ft Or: Every person who was waiting in the place where dead people stay \f*
\add became alive again, in order to stand before the throne\add*.
\add God\add* judged each one of them according to what each one had done.
\v 14 All the unbelievers [PRS, MTY] —those who had been in the place where they waited after they
died—\add were thrown into the burning lake\add*. The burning lake is
\add the place in which people\add* die the second time. 
\v 15 The people whose \add names\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* are not in the book, the one
\add where God\add* has written \add the names of people who\add* have
\add eternal\add* life, \add were also thrown\add* {◄\add God\f + \ft Or: God \f*'s
angel\add*► threw them also} \add into the lake\add* of fire.
