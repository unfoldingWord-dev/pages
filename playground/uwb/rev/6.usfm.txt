\c 6  
\s Revelation 6:1-8 
\s When the Lamb opened each of the first four seals of the scroll, each of the four living creatures called forth a mounted
horseman who brought judgment to people on the earth. 
\p
\v 1 I saw that \add Jesus, the one who is like a\add* lamb, opened the first of the seven seals
\add of the scroll\add*. Then I heard one of the four living \add creatures\add* say in a voice
\add as loud\add* as \f + \ft simile \f* thunder, "Come!" 
\v 2 Then I saw a white horse \add come out\add*. The one who sat on it had a bow
\add and arrows\add*. \add God\add* gave him a crown \add to show that he was the
king\add*. Then the one who conquers \add people\add* went out to continue to conquer
\add people\add*. 
\v 3 When the \add one who was like a\add* lamb opened the second seal, I heard the second living
\add creature\add* say, "Come!" 
\v 4 Then a red horse came out. The one sitting on it was allowed
\f + \ft Or:\add God\add* allowed the one sitting on it \f* to cause \add people\add* to no longer
\add live\add* peacefully, but instead to be killing each other.
\add For this purpose\add* he was given \f + \ft Or:\add God's agent\add* gave to him \f* a large sword.
\v 5 When \add the one who is like a\add* lamb opened the third seal, I heard the third living
\add creature\add* say, "Come!" This time, I saw a black horse \add come
out\add*. The one who sat on it had a pair of balance scales in his hand.
\v 6 I heard a voice \add that sounded\add* like \add it was coming
from\add* among the four living \add creatures\add*. It was saying
\add to the horseman\f + \ft Or: to the man who was sitting on the horse\add* \f*, "A quart of wheat
\add will cost so much that\add* a man must work a whole day to earn enough money to buy it, and three quarts of barley will
sell for the same price. But do not cut off \add the supply of\add* olive oil or the wine \f + \ft metonymy \f*!"
\v 7 When the \add one who is like a\add* lamb opened the fourth seal, I heard the fourth living
\add creature\add* say, "Come!" 
\v 8 This time I saw a pale horse \add come out\add*. The one who sat on it is named
'\add The one who causes\add* death \f + \ft personification \f*,' and \add the one that is named 'The place where dead people
go'\add* accompanied him. \add God\add* gave them authority over one quarter of the people on earth to incite them to kill each
other with weapons \f + \ft synecdoche \f*, and also authority to kill them by means of
\add their causing them to\add* lack food\f + \ft Or: by famine \f*, by means of
\add their causing them to become\add* sick from epidemics, and by means of
\add their causing\add* wild animals \add to attack them\add*. 
\s Revelation 6:9-11 
\s When the Lamb opened the fifth seal, the souls of dead believers appealed to God to judge those who killed them, but God
told them to rest a bit longer. 
\p
\v 9 When the \add one who is like a\add* lamb opened the fifth seal, I saw under \f + \ft Or: at the base of \f* the altar
\add in heaven\add* the souls of \add God's servants\add* who had been killed \f + \ft Or:whom
\add people had\add* killed \f* because of \add their believing\add* God's message, and because they told others
\add the message about Jesus\add*. 
\v 10 They spoke loudly \add to God\add* saying, "Sovereign\f + \ft Or: Almighty \f* Lord, you are holy and true. How long
\add will it be\add* before you judge \add and punish\add* the people on earth who
murdered\add us\f + \ft exclusive \f*\add*?" 
\v 11  \add God\add* gave to each of them a long white robe, and
\add he\add* told them to rest a little longer until \add people\add* killed all the believers who served
\add the Lord\add* with them. They were believers whom \add God wanted to die in just the same
way\add* that these others had been killed. 
\s Revelation 6:12-17 
\s When the Lamb opened the sixth seal of the scroll, the upheaval in the sky and on the earth caused all the rebellious people
on earth to hide because they knew God's judgment time had come.
\p
\v 12 I saw that when \add the one who is like a\add* lamb opened the sixth seal, the earth shook violently. The sun became as
black as cloth made of \add black\add* wool\f + \ft Or: of pitch \f*. The whole moon became
\add red\add* \f + \ft simile \f* like blood. 
\v 13 The stars fell to the earth \add in great numbers\add*, just \f + \ft simile \f* like immature figs fall when a fig tree is shaken by a
strong wind \f + \ft Or:when a strong wind shakes a fig tree \f*. 
\v 14 The sky split open and \add rolled up on either side\add* just \f + \ft simile \f* like an
\add old\add* scroll rolls up \add when it is split in two\add*. Every mountain and island moved out of its place.
\v 15  \add As a result, all the rebellious people\add* of the earth,
\add including\add* kings, high-ranking people, generals, the rich people, the powerful people, along with
every\add body else\add*, both slave and free, hid themselves in caves and between the mountain rocks.
\v 16 They shouted to the mountains and to the rocks, "Fall on us\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* and hide
us\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* in order that the one who sits upon the throne will not be able to see
us\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*, and \add in order that\add* the \add one who is like
a\add* lamb will not be able to punish \f + \ft metonymy \f* us\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add*! 
\v 17 This is the great\f + \ft Or: terrible \f* day on which they will punish \f + \ft metonymy \f*
us\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add*, and \add when that happens\add*, no one will be able to survive!\f + \ft Or: who will be able to endure? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*"
