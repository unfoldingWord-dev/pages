\c 18  
\s Revelation 18:1-3 
\s A powerful angel descended from heaven and announced that the cities represented by Babylon were about to be completely
destroyed because of their immorality and idolatry. 
\p
\v 1 After this I saw another angel, who had great authority, coming down from heaven. The earth became bright
\add because\add* he was shining so intensely\f + \ft Or: brightly \f*. 
\v 2 He shouted with a very loud voice, “\add God is about to\add* completely destroy \\f + \\ft doublet \\f* all the very
\add evil\add* cities \f + \ft (OR, the very evil \add city\add*) \f* \add that\add* Babylon
\add represents\add*. As a result, all \add kinds of\add* evil spirits \\f + \\ft doublet \\f* will live there, and all
\add kinds of\add* foul and detestable \\f + \\ft doublet \\f* birds will live there.
\v 3  \add God will destroy those cities\add* because \add their rulers have
persuaded\add* the people of \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* all nations to act very immorally
\add and idolatrously with the people of\add* \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* \add those cities, just
like\add* a prostitute persuades men to drink \add strong\add* wine and then commit fornication with her. The rulers of the
earth have also acted immorally \add and idolatrously\add* with the people of \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* those cities. The merchants of the earth
have become rich \add because the people of those cities\add* strongly desired
\add and bought from the merchants\add* many ◄luxuries\f + \ft Or: expensive \f* things►.”
\s Revelation 18:4-5 
\s John heard Jesus tell God's people to flee out of those cities.
\p
\v 4 I heard \add Jesus\add* speak from heaven. He said, “My people, flee from
\add those cities\add*, in order that you do not sin as the people
\add of those cities do. If you sin as they do\add*, I will punish you as I will punish them.
\v 5  \add It is as though\add* their sins have been piled {have piled} up to heaven, and God remembers them \\f + \\ft doublet \\f*,
\add so now he will punish them\add* \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f*.” 
\s Revelation 18:6-8 
\s Jesus sentenced the cities represented by Babylon to destruction.
\p
\v 6  \add To the angels whom God assigned to punish those cities, Jesus
said\add*, “Pay back\f + \ft Or: Punish \f* the people of those cities to the same extent that they harmed
\add other people\add*. Cause them to suffer twice as much \add as they caused other people to
suffer\add* [DOU, MET]. 
\v 7 To the same extent that they have honored themselves and done the things that they wanted to do, to that extent torment
them and cause them to grieve. \add Do that because\add* in their minds they think, ‘We rule as queens! We are not widows, and
we will never mourn \add as widows do!\add*’ 
\v 8 So in one day terrible calamities\f + \ft Or: troubles \f* will come upon them.
\add The people in those cities\add* will die, others will mourn for them, people will be hungry
\add because there will be no food\add*, and \add their cities\add* will be burned up. The Lord God is able to punish those
cities \add like that\add*, because he is mighty.” 
\s Revelation 18:9-19 
\s Earth's kings, merchants, and maritime traders mourned the loss of those cities.
\p
\v 9 “The kings of the earth who have acted immorally \add with people of those
cities\add* and have lived with the people of those cities, doing just what they wanted to do, will weep and mourn \\f + \\ft doublet \\f* for
them when they see the smoke of the fire that is burning them. 
\v 10 They will stand far away \add from those cities\add*, because they will be afraid
\add that they will suffer just like the people of those cities\add* are suffering. They will say, ‘Terrible things will happen
to the awesome and mighty cities \add represented by\add* Babylon!
\add God\add* will punish them suddenly and swiftly \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f*!’ 
\v 11 The merchants of the earth will weep and will mourn \\f + \\ft doublet \\f* \add for those
cities\add*, because no one will ever again buy the things that they have
\add to sell to the people in those cities\add*. 
\v 12-13  \add They sell ornaments made\add* of gold, silver, precious stones, and pearls. They sell
\add expensive cloth made of\add* fine linen and silk, \add expensive cloth that is
dyed\add* purple and crimson. They sell all kinds of \add rare\add* wood, all kinds of items
\add made of\add* ivory, costly wood, bronze, iron, and marble. They sell cinnamon, spice, perfume, frankincense, wine, olive
oil, fine flour, and grain. They sell cattle, sheep, horses, and chariots. They even sell human beings [SYN, DOU] to become
slaves. 
\v 14  \add The merchants will say\add*, ‘The good things you people longed to have are gone! All your luxurious and splendid
\\f + \\ft doublet \\f* \add possessions have vanished!\add* They will be gone forever\f + \ft Or: You \f* will never have them again \\f + \\ft litotes \\f*!’
\v 15 The merchants \add who sold\add* these things and who had become rich by
\add supplying them\add* for those \add cities\add* will stand far away, because they will be afraid
\add that they will suffer just like\add* the people \add of those
cities\add* are suffering. They will weep and mourn \\f + \\ft doublet \\f*, 
\v 16 and they will say, ‘Terrible things \\f + \\ft doublet \\f* have happened to the awesome\f + \ft Or: great \f* \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* cities!
\add They were like queens\add* who dressed themselves in \add clothes made
of\add* \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* fine linen \add cloth\add* and expensive cloth dyed purple and crimson, and who were adorned with gold, precious
stones, and pearls. 
\v 17 But suddenly and swiftly \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* \add God\add* has destroyed these expensive things.’ Every ship captain, all people who
travel by ship, all ◄sailors\f + \ft Or: those \f* who work on ships►, and all others who earn their living
\add by traveling on\add* the ocean will stand far away \add from those
cities\add*. 
\v 18 When they see the smoke of the fire that is burning those cities, they will shout, ‘◄No
\add other\add* cities have ever been so awesome!\f + \ft Or: Was \f* there ever any other city that was as awesome as those cities?►’ \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f*
\v 19 They will throw dust on their heads \add to show that they are
sad\add*, and they will shout, weep, and mourn \\f + \\ft doublet \\f*. They will say, ‘Terrible things have happened to the awesome\f + \ft Or: great \f*
cities, the cities that made all people who own ships \add that sail\add* on the ocean become rich by
\add carrying\add* their costly ◄things to sell\f + \ft Or: merchandise \f*►! \add God\add* has suddenly and swiftly destroyed \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* those
cities!’” 
\s Revelation 18:20-24 
\s All of God's people who belong to heaven are called to rejoice because God has pronounced judgment on the cities represented
by Babylon. 
\p
\v 20 Then someone spoke from heaven saying, “You who live in heaven, rejoice over what has happened to
\add the cities represented by\add* Babylon! You who are God's people, including you apostles, you ◄prophets\f + \ft Or: who \f* speak messages
that come directly from God►, rejoice, because God has justly punished the people of those cities because they acted evilly
toward you!” 
\p
\v 21 Then a mighty angel picked up a boulder the size of a large stone for grinding grain, and he threw it into the ocean.
Then he said, “O you people in \\f + \\ft apostrophe \\f* the awesome\f + \ft Or: great \f* cities \add represented
by\add* Babylon, your cities will be destroyed so that they will disappear just like that stone disappeared in the ocean! Your
cities will be gone forever \\f + \\ft litotes \\f*! 
\v 22 In your cities there will never again be \add anyone\add* playing harps, singing, playing flutes, and blowing trumpets.
There will no longer be any ◄skilled workers\f + \ft Or: craftsmen \f*► making things. There will never again be people grinding
\add grain at\add* \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* the mills. 
\v 23 No lamplight will ever again shine. There will never again be the
\add happy\add* voices of a bridegroom and his bride. \add God will destroy your
cities\add* because your merchants were the most \add deceiving\add* men in the world. You persuaded them to deceive
\add people of\add* \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* all nations. 
\v 24 You are also \add responsible for killing\add* \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* \add the\add* prophets and
\add others\add* of God's people. Indeed, you are the ones who are guilty for the deaths of all those who have been {whom
\add others\add* have} killed on the earth!”
