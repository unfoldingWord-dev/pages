\c 22  
\s Revelation 22:1-5 
\s God will supply abundant life in the city, his servants will worship him face-to-face, no one will be there whom God would
curse, and his servants will reign forever and ever. 
\p
\v 1 The angel showed me the river of water \add that causes people who drink from
it\add* to live \add forever\add*. The water was sparkling and clear like crystal. The river was flowing out from the throne
where God and the \add one who is like a\add* lamb \add were sitting\add*.
\v 2 It flowed down through the middle of the \add main\add* street of the city. On each side of the river were trees
\add having fruit that causes people who eat it\add* to live forever.
\add The trees\add* bear twelve \add crops\add* \f + \fr (OR, twelve \add kinds\add*) \f* of fruit;
\add they\add* produce one crop each month. The \add people of the\add* nations \f + \fr metonymy \f*
\add use\add* the leaves of the trees \add as medicine\add* in order that they may be strengthened.
\v 3 There will never be \add anyone or anything there that God\add* will curse. The throne of God and of the
\add one who is like a\add* lamb will be in the city. And his servants will worship him there.
\v 4 They will see him face-to-face, and his name will be \add written\add*
{\add he\add* will \add write\add* his name} on their foreheads.
\v 5 There will never again be night. \add God's servants\add* will not need the light of a lamp or the light of the sun,
because the Lord God will shine his light upon them. And they will rule forever.
\s Revelation 22:6-7 
\s God verified the revelation of his message to his servants in which he showed them what must happen soon.
\p
\v 6 The angel said to me: “These words that\add God has revealed to
you\add* are true, and he will certainly fulfill them. The Lord God who
◄\add inspires\add* the prophets/tells the prophets what to say► sent his angel to show the people who serve him the events
that must happen soon.” 
\v 7  \add Jesus says to all his people\add*, “Listen \add to\add* this! I am coming soon;
\add God will abundantly\add* bless everyone who obeys the message that
\add has been written\add* in this book.” 
\s Revelation 22:8-11 
\s John attested that he has himself heard and seen all these things. He was told to tell others the revelation because its
fulfillment was near, and everyone should be ready. 
\p
\v 8 I, John, am the one who heard and saw \add in a vision\add* these things
\add that I have written down\add*. When I had heard and seen \add them\add*, I immediately knelt down at the feet of the angel
who was showing them to me, in order to worship him. 
\v 9 But he said to me, “Do not \add worship me\add*! I am \add just\add* your fellow servant! I am also the fellow servant of
your fellow believers who are ◄the prophets/the ones who tell messages that come directly from God►, and I am a fellow servant
of those who obey the message in this book. \add Instead\add*, worship God!”
\v 10 He also said to me, “Do not keep secret the message about what
\add God\add* has foretold in this book, because it is almost time \f + \fr metonymy \f* for him to
\add fulfill this message\add*. 
\v 11  \add Since that time is near, if\add* those who act in an evil manner
\add want to\add* continue to act that way \f + \fr irony \f*, \add that is up to them. God will
soon\add* ◄\add pay them back/punish them\add*► \add for that. If\add* those who are vile
\add want to\add* continue to be vile \f + \fr irony \f*, \add that is up to them. God will
soon\add* ◄\add pay them back/punish them\add*► \add for that\add*. Those who are
\add acting\add* righteously should continue to act righteously. Those who are holy should continue to be holy.”
\s Revelation 22:12-16 
\s Jesus announced that he had sent his angel to bear witness to the congregations about all that John had seen. He
authoritatively identified himself as the Descendant of King David and as the Messianic Morning Star.
\p
\v 12  \add Jesus says to all people\add*: “Listen! I am coming soon! And I will pay back and
\add punish or\add* reward everyone according to what each one has done.
\v 13 I \add am\add* the one who began all things \f + \fr metaphor \f* and the one who will cause all things to end \f + \fr metaphor \f*. I am before
\add all things\add* and I am at the end \add of all things\add* \f + \fr doublet \f*.
\v 14  \add God\add* is very pleased with the people who wash their
robes\add , making themselves spiritually clean\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f*, because they will be able to
\add eat the fruit of\add* \f + \fr metonymy \f* the tree \add that enables people\add* to live
\add forever\add*, and because they will \add be able\add* to enter the gates into the
\add holy\add* city. 
\v 15 Outside \add are people who are unholy. They include\add* people who practice sorcery, people who sin sexually,
murderers, idol worshipers, and all people who enjoy telling lies and are continual liars.
\add They can never enter that city\add*.” 
\p
\v 16 “I, Jesus, sent my angel in order that he might say to you who are in the
congregations\add that all\add* these things \add are true\add*. I am the descendant of
\add King\add* David \add whom the prophets promised would come\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f*. I am the
\add one who is like\add* the bright morning star \f + \fr metaphor \f*, the one
\add that Moses promised would come\add*.” 
\s Revelation 22:17 
\s God's Spirit and the Bride invite all who desire to drink the living water to come and drink, and they invite all who hear
to extend the invitation to others. 
\p
\v 17  \add God's\add* Spirit and \add his people, who are like\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f* the bride
\add of Christ\add*, say \add to each one who desires to believe\add*, “Come!” Whoever hears
\add this\add* should also say \add to each one who desires to believe\add*, “Come!” The
\add spiritually thirsty people should come\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f*! Everyone who desires the water
\add that enables people to\add* live \add forever\add* should take it as a free gift!
\s Revelation 22:18-19 
\s Jesus warned about what would happen to anyone who adds to the message of the book or who takes away any message of its
revelation. 
\p
\v 18 “I, \add Jesus, solemnly\add* warn everyone who hears the message about what
\add I\add* have foretold in this book: If anyone adds anything to this message, God will cause him to experience the plagues
that are {that \add I\add* have} described in this book. 
\v 19 If anyone takes away any of the message about what \add I\add* have foretold in this book, God will take away that
person's right \add to eat fruit from\add* \f + \fr metonymy \f* the tree \add that enables
people\add* to live \add forever\add*. He \add will also take away\add* that person's right
\add to enter\add* God's city. \add Both these things\add* are described
{\add I\add* have described \add both these things\add*} in this book.”
\s Revelation 22:20 
\s Jesus declares that he is certainly coming soon. 
\p
\v 20  \add Jesus\add*, who says that \add all\add* these things are true, says, “Certainly I am coming soon!”
\add I, John, reply\add*, “◄May it be so!/Amen!► Lord Jesus, come!”
\s Revelation 22:21 
\s John closes with a prayer that Jesus will continue to bless all God's people.
\p
\v 21  \add I pray that our\add* Lord Jesus \add will continue to\add* act kindly to all
\add of you who are God's people\add*. ◄Amen!/May it be so!►
