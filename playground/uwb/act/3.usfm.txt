\s Acts 3:1-8 
\s Peter healed a lame man, so the people were amazed. 
\p
\v 1  \add One day\add* Peter and John were going to the Temple \add courtyard\add*. It was three o'clock in the afternoon, at
the time when people prayed \add there publicly\add*. 
\v 2 There was a man there who had been lame from the time he was born. He
\add was sitting by\add* the gate called Beautiful \add Gate\add*, at the entrance to the Temple
\add area\add*. People put him there every day, so that he could ask those who were entering
\add or leaving\add* the temple courtyard to give him some money.
\p
\v 3 As Peter and John were about to enter \add the Temple courtyard\add*, he saw them and asked them several times to give him
some money. \f + \ft Or: he said to them several times, "Please give me some money!" \f*
\v 4 As Peter and John looked directly at him, Peter said to him, "Look at us!"
\v 5 So he looked directly at them, expecting to get some \add money\add* from them.
\v 6 Then Peter said to him, "I do not have any money \f + \ft metonymy \f*, but what I
\add can do\add*, I will \add do\add* for you. Jesus Christ, \add who
was\add* from Nazareth \add town\add*, has authorized \f + \ft metonymy \f* me \add to heal you! So get up
and\add* walk!" 
\v 7 Then Peter grasped his right hand and helped him to stand up. Immediately the man's feet and ankles became strong.
\v 8 He jumped up and began to walk! Then he entered the Temple \add area\add* with them, walking and leaping and praising God!
\s Acts 3:9-10 
\s The people were amazed. 
\p
\v 9 All the people \add there\add* saw him walking and praising God.
\v 10 They recognized that he was the man who used to sit at the Beautiful Gate in the Temple
\add courtyard\add* and ask \add people\add* for money! So all the people there were greatly amazed at what had happened to
him. 
\v 11 As the man clung to Peter and John, all the people were so surprised
\add that they did not know what to think\add*! So they ran to them at the place
\add in the Temple courtyard\add* that is called \f + \ft Or:that \add people\add* call \f* Solomon's Porch.
\s Acts 3:12-16 
\s Peter explained that Jesus healed the man, and they should repent.
\p
\v 12 When Peter saw that, he said to them, "fellow Israelites, you should not be surprised about what has happened to this
man!\f + \ft Or: why are you so surprised about what has happened to this man? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* And you should not stare at us, either! You seem to
\f + \ft rhetorical question \f* think that the two of us enabled this man to walk because we\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* ourselves are powerful or because we please
God very much! 
\v 13  \add So I will tell you what is really happening\add*. Our ancestors, including Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, worshipped
God. And now he has greatly honored Jesus, who always served him. Your
\add leaders\add* brought Jesus \add to the governor, Pilate\add*, so that
\add his soldiers would kill him\add*. And \add God considers that\add* in front of Pilate you
\add were the ones who rejected\add* Jesus \add as your king\add*, after Pilate had decided that he should release Jesus.
\v 14  \add Although Jesus\add* always did what was right\f + \ft Or: just \f* and good, you rejected him.
\add Pilate wanted to release him, but\add* you urgently asked Pilate to release a murderer\f + \ft Or: someone who had killed people \f*!
\v 15  \add God considers that\add* you killed \add Jesus\add*, the one who gives people
\add eternal\add* life. But God has greatly honored him by causing him to become alive again after he died\f + \ft Or: by raising him from
the dead \f*. Many of us saw \add him after that, and now\add* we\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* are telling
\add you\add* about it. 
\v 16 It is because \add we two\add* trusted in what Jesus \f + \ft metonymy, personification \f*
\add could do, that he\add* made this man, whom you see and know, strong again. Yes, it is because
we\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* trusted in Jesus that he has completely healed this man for all of you to see."
\s Acts 3:17-26 
\s Peter told them to repent. 
\p
\v 17 "Now, my fellow-countrymen, I know that you and your leaders did that
\add to Jesus\add* because you \add and they\add* did not know \add that he was the
Messiah\add*. 
\v 18 However, \add your putting him to death\add* was what God had predicted that people would do.
\add Long ago\add* he told all the prophets \f + \ft metonymy \f* to write \add what people would do to the Messiah. They
wrote\add* that the Messiah, whom God \add would send\add*, would suffer
\add and die\add*. 
\v 19 So, turn away from your sinful behavior and ask God\add to help
you\add* do what pleases \add him\add*, in order that he may completely forgive you for your sins.
\v 20  \add If you do that\add*, there will be times \add when you will know
that\add* the Lord \add God is\add* helping \add you\add*. And some day he will
\add again\add* send back \add to earth\add* the Messiah, whom he appointed for you. That person is Jesus.
\v 21 Jesus must stay in heaven until the time when God will cause all that he has created to become new. Long ago God promised
\add to do that, and\add* he chose holy prophets to tell \add that to
people\add*. 
\v 22 For \add example, the prophet\add* Moses said \add this about the
Messiah\add*: 'The Lord your God\f + \ft Or: the God whom you \add worship\add* \f* will cause someone to become a prophet to tell you
\add words from God. God will send him\add* as \add he sent\add* me,
\add and he will be\add* from among your own people. You must listen to everything that this prophet tells you
\add and obey him\add* \f + \ft synecdoche \f*. 
\v 23  \add Those who\add* do not listen to \add that prophet and
obey\add* him will no longer belong to God's people, and \add God\add* will get rid of them'."
\v 24  \add Peter continued\add*, "All the prophets have told \add about what would happen
during\add* these days \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add in which we\f + \ft inclusive \f* are living. Those prophets
include\add* Samuel \add and all the others who\add* later also spoke
\add about these events\add* before they happened. 
\v 25 You \add as well as we\f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* are the people \add to whom God sent the Messiah,
as\add* the prophets said \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add that he would\add*. And when God strongly promised
\add to bless\add* our ancestors, he also surely promised to bless you. He said to Abraham
\add concerning the Messiah\add*, '\add I\add* will bless all people on the earth as a result of
\add what\add* your descendant \add will do\add*.'" 
\v 26  \add Peter concluded\add*, "\add So\add* when God sent \add to the
earth\add* Jesus, the one who always obeys him\f + \ft Or: his servant Jesus \f*, he sent him first to you
\add Israelites\add* to bless you. \add God will\add* enable you to stop doing what is wicked
\add and to start doing what pleases him\add*."
