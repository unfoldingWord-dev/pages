\c 6  
\s Acts 6:1 
\s The believers neglected the Greek-speaking widows. 
\p
\v 1 During that time, many more people were becoming believers\add . Some of them were from other countries and spoke only the
Greek language, but most of them had always lived in Israel and spoke the Hebrew
language\add*. Those who spoke Greek began to complain about those who spoke Hebrew. They were saying. “When
\add you Hebrew-speaking believers\add* distribute \add food or money\add* to widows every day, you are not giving fair amounts
to the widows who speak Greek!” 
\s Acts 6:2-4 
\s The apostles told the other believers to choose men to care for those widows.
\p
\v 2 So, \add after the\add* twelve \add apostles had heard what they were
saying\add*, they summoned all the \add other\add* believers \add in Jerusalem to
meet\add* together. Then the apostles said \add to them\add*, “We\add (exc)\add* would not be doing right if we stopped
\add preaching and teaching\add* God's message \add about Jesus\add* in order to distribute food [MTY]
\add and money to the widows\add*! 
\v 3 So, fellow believers, carefully choose seven men from among you, men whom
\add you\add* know that the Spirit \add of God\add* controls completely and who are very wise. Then
we\add (exc)\add* will appoint them to do this work, 
\v 4 and we\add (exc)\add* will use our time to pray and to preach and teach the message
\add about Jesus\add*.” 
\s Acts 6:5-6 
\s The apostles appointed seven men to care for the widows' needs.
\p
\v 5 What the apostles recommended pleased all of the \add other\add* believers. So they chose Stephen. He was a man who
strongly believed \add in God\add* and whom the Holy Spirit controlled completely.
\add They also chose\add* Philip, Procorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolas who was from Antioch
\add city\add*. Nicolas had accepted the Jewish religion \add before he had believed in
Jesus\add*. 
\v 6 They brought these \add seven\add* men to the apostles. Then after the apostles prayed
\add for those men\add*, they placed their hands on \add the heads of each one
of\add* them \add to appoint them to do that work\add*. 
\s Acts 6:7 
\s The number of people who were becoming believers increased greatly.
\p
\v 7 So \add the believers\add* continued to tell many people the message from God. ◄The number of people in Jerusalem who
believed \add in Jesus\add* was increasing greatly./More and more people in Jerusalem were believing in Jesus.►
\add Among them\add* were many \add Jewish\add* priests who were believing the message
\add about Jesus\add*. 
\s Acts 6:8-10 
\s People opposed Stephen, but could not refute his arguments. 
\p
\v 8 God was enabling Stephen to do many things by God's power. He was doing many amazing miracles among the
\add Jewish\add* people. 
\v 9 However, some people opposed Stephen. They were Jews from a group
\add that regularly met together in a Jewish meeting place that was\add*
{\add that people\add*} called the Freedmen's Meeting Place. \add Those people were
from\add* Cyrene and Alexandria \add cities\add* and \add also\add* from Cilicia and Asia
\add provinces\add*. They all began to argue with Stephen. 
\v 10 But they were not able ◄to refute \add what he said/to prove that what he said was
wrong\add*►, \add because God's\add* Spirit enabled him to speak very wisely.
\s Acts 6:11-14 
\s People persuaded some men to falsely accuse Stephen. 
\p
\v 11 Then they secretly persuaded \add some\add* men to \add falsely accuse Stephen. Those men
said\add*, “We\add (exc)\add* heard him say bad things about Moses and God.”
\v 12 So, \add by saying that\add*, they made the \add other Jewish\add* people
angry\add at Stephen, including\add* the elders and the teachers of the
\add Jewish\add* laws. Then \add they all\add* seized Stephen and took him to the Jewish Council.
\v 13 They \add also\add* brought in some men who accused him falsely
\add about several things\add*. They said, “This fellow continually says bad things about this holy Temple and about the laws
\add that Moses received from God\add*. 
\v 14 Specifically, we\add (exc)\add* have heard him say that this Jesus from Nazareth
\add town\add* will destroy this Temple and will tell us to obey different customs than Moses
\add taught our ancestors\add*.” 
\s Acts 6:15 
\s The people saw Stephen's face shining like the face of an angel.
\p
\v 15 When all \add the people\add* who were sitting in the Council
\add room heard that, and as they\add* all stared at Stephen, they saw that his face was
\add shining\add* [SIM] like the face of an angel.
