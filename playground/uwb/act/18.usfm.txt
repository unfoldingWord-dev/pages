\s Acts 18:1-4 
\s In Corinth, Paul helped many people to become believers. 
\p
\v 1 After that, Paul left Athens \add city\add* and went to Corinth
\add city\add*. 
\v 2 There he met a Jew whose name was Aquila, who grew up in Pontus
\add province\add*. Aquila and his wife Priscilla had recently come from
\add Rome, in\add* Italy\add . They had previously left Rome\add* because Claudius,
\add the Roman Emperor\add*, had ordered that all the Jews must leave Rome. Paul went to see Aquila and Priscilla.
\v 3 Those two made tents \add to earn\add* \add money\f + \ft Or: a living\add* \f*. Paul also made tents, so he stayed with them and they
all worked together. 
\v 4 Every Sabbath, Paul \add went\add* to the Jewish meeting place, where he spoke forcefully to both Jews and non-Jews. He
repeatedly tried to persuade them \add that Jesus is the Messiah\add*.
\s Acts 18:5-8 
\s Paul helped many non-Jews become believers. 
\p
\v 5 Then Silas and Timothy arrived there from Macedonia province. After they arrived, Paul
\add did not make tents anymore. He\add* used all his time preaching
\add the message about Jesus in the Jewish meeting place\add*. He continued to tell the Jews
\add that\add* the Messiah they knew about was Jesus. 
\v 6 But the Jews began to oppose Paul and to say evil things about him. So he shook
\add the dust from\add* his clothes \add to show them that they were displeasing God.
Then\add* he said to them, "If God punishes you, it will be your \f + \ft synecdoche \f* own fault \f + \ft metonymy \f*, not mine! From now on I will go
\add and preach\add* to non-Jewish people!" 
\v 7 So Paul left \add the worship house\add* and went into a house that was next to it,
\add and preached there\add*. Titius Justus, the owner of the house, was a non-Jewish man who had accepted what the Jews
believe. 
\v 8  \add After that\add*, the ruler of the Jewish meeting place,
\add whose name was\add* Crispus, and all of his family \f + \ft metonymy \f* believed in the Lord
\add Jesus\add*. Many other people in Corinth who listened \add to
Paul\add* also believed \add in Jesus\add*. Then they were baptized.
\add But there were people who still opposed Paul and his preaching\add*.
\s Acts 18:9-11 
\s Jesus commanded Paul to continue speaking about him, so Paul did that.
\p
\v 9 One night Paul had a vision in which the Lord \add Jesus\add* said to him, "Do not be afraid
\add of those who oppose you\add*. Instead, you should continue speaking
\add to people about me\add*. Do not stop, 
\v 10 because I \add will help\add* you and no one will be able to harm
you\add \f + \ft singular \f* here. Keep telling them about me\add*, because there are many people in this city who will
\add believe in\add* me." 
\v 11 So Paul stayed in Corinth for a year and a half, teaching the people the message from God
\add about Jesus\add*. 
\s Acts 18:12-17 
\s Gallio refused to judge Paul. 
\p
\v 12 When Gallio was the \add Roman\add* governor of Achaia \add province\add*, the Jewish
\add leaders\add* \f + \ft synecdoche \f* there got together and seized Paul. They took him before the governor
\add and accused him\add*, 
\v 13 saying, "This man is teaching people \add a false religion, leading
them\add* to worship God in ways that are contrary to our \add Jewish\add* laws."
\v 14 When Paul was about to speak \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add to defend himself\add*, Gallio said to the Jews, "If this man had acted
deceitfully or disobeyed \add any of our Roman\add* laws, I would listen
\add patiently\add* to what you Jews \add want to tell me\add*. 
\v 15 However, you are merely arguing about words and names and your own
\add Jewish\add* laws, so you yourselves need to resolve this. I refuse to judge these things!"
\v 16 After Gallio \add had said that\add*, he \add commanded some
soldiers\f + \ft Or: guards \f*\add* that \add they\add* expel those \add Jewish
leaders\add* from the courtroom. 
\v 17 Then \add the mob\add* grabbed the leader of the Jewish meeting place, Sosthenes. They beat him, right there in front of
the courthouse. But Gallio did nothing about it. 
\s Acts 18:18-21 
\s At Ephesus, Paul parted from Priscilla and Aquila. 
\p
\v 18 Paul stayed on with the believers in Corinth for many days\f + \ft Or: some time \f*. Then he left the believers there, and went with
Priscilla and \add her husband\add* Aquila. They went down to Cenchrea,
\add a port city\add*. There Paul had his head shaved {\add someone\add* shave his head} in order to partially complete a vow
that he had taken. Then they got on a ship and sailed for Syria \add province\add*.
\v 19 They arrived at Ephesus \add city\add*, and Priscilla and Aquila stayed there.
\p \add Before Paul left Ephesus\add*, he entered the Jewish meeting place and lectured to the Jews.
\v 20 They asked him to stay longer, but he refused. 
\v 21 But, as he left, he told them, "I will come back, if God wills\f + \ft Or: desires \f*
\add me to do that\add*." Then, \add because he wanted to be in Jerusalem to finish completing that
vow\add*, he got on\add a ship that\add* sailed from Ephesus. 
\s Acts 18:22-23 
\s Paul visited Jerusalem, then he went on to Antioch in Syria and then he returned to visit the believers throughout Galatia
and Phrygia. 
\p
\v 22 When the ship arrived at Caesarea, \add a port city\add*, Paul
\add got off. He\add* went up \add to Jerusalem\add* and greeted the believers there. Then he went back down to Antioch
\add city in Syria province\add*. 
\p
\v 23 Paul spent some time \add with the believers\add* there. Then he left Antioch and traveled to several towns
\add that he had visited previously\add* in Galatia and Phrygia \add provinces\add*. He taught all of the believers more
\add of the message from God about Jesus\add*. 
\s Acts 18:24-26 
\s Priscilla and Aquila instructed Apollos about the gospel. 
\p
\v 24  \add While Paul was traveling in Galatia and Phrygia\add*, a Jewish man whose name was Apollos came to Ephesus. He was a
native of Alexandria \add city\add*. He \add spoke eloquently\add* and he knew the Scriptures thoroughly.
\v 25  \add Other believers\add* had taught him \add some things\add* about how the Lord
\add Jesus desires that people\add* should conduct themselves, and he taught those things very enthusiastically
\add to people. He had heard\add* some of the things that Jesus did and said, and he taught those facts accurately
\add to people. However, he was teaching incompletely about Jesus,
because\add* he knew only what John \add the Baptizer had taught people whom
he\add* baptized. 
\v 26 Apollos went to the Jewish meeting place, and he told the people there very confidently the things that he had learned.
When Priscilla and Aquila heard what he taught, they invited him
\add to their home\add*. There they explained more accurately to him the way
\add that\add* God \add gives people eternal life\add*. 
\s Acts 18:27-28 
\s Apollos helped believers in Achaia. 
\p
\v 27 When Apollos decided that he would like to go to Achaia \add province\add*, the believers in Ephesus told him that it
would be good for him to do that. So they wrote a letter to the believers
\add in Achaia saying that they\add* should welcome Apollos. \add So Apollos got on a ship and went to
Corinth\add*. After he arrived, he greatly helped those whom \add God\add* had kindly enabled to believe
\add in Jesus\add*. 
\v 28 Apollos was vigorously arguing publicly with \add the leaders
of\add* the Jews while many other people listened. \add By quoting\add* from the Scriptures, he proved to them that Jesus was
the Messiah.
