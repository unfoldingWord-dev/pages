\s Acts 2:1-4 
\s The Holy Spirit came and enabled the disciples to speak other languages.
\p
\v 1 On the day when \add the Jews were celebrating\add* Pentecost
\add festival\add*, the \add believers\add* were all together in one place
\add in Jerusalem\add*. 
\v 2 Suddenly \add they heard\add* a noise \add coming\add* from the sky
\add that sounded\add* like a strong wind. Everyone in the entire house where they were sitting heard the noise.
\v 3 Then they saw \add what looked\add* like flames of fire. These flames separated
\add from one another\add*, and \add one of them\add* came down on
\add the head of\add* each of the believers. 
\v 4 Then all of the believers were completely controlled\f + \ft Or: empowered \f* by the Holy Spirit {the Holy Spirit completely
controlled\f + \ft Or: empowered \f* all of the believers}, and he enabled them to begin speaking other languages \f + \ft metonymy \f*
\add that they had not learned\add*. 
\s Acts 2:5-13 
\s Jews from many places were amazed to hear their native languages spoken by the believers.
\p
\v 5 At that time \add many\add* Jews were staying in Jerusalem \add to celebrate Pentecost festival. They were people
who\add* always tried to obey\add the Jewish\add* laws. \add They had
come\add* from many different \f + \ft hyperbole \f* countries. 
\v 6 When they heard that \add loud\add* noise \add like a wind\add*, a crowd came together
\add to the place where the believers were\add*. The crowd was amazed\f + \ft Or: did not know what to think \f*, because each of them was
hearing \add one of\add* the believers speaking in that person's own language.
\v 7 They were completely amazed, and they said \add to each other\add*, “All these men who are speaking have \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\add always\add* resided in Galilee \add district, so they would not know our
languages\add*. 
\v 8 ◄\add We(inc) do not understand\add* how these men can speak our own native languages!\f + \ft Or: How \f* can these men speak our own
native languages?► \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add But\add* all of us hear them \add doing
that\add*! 
\v 9  \add Some of us are from the regions of\add* Parthia and Media and Elam, and
\add others of us\add* reside \add in the regions of\add* Mesopotamia, Judea, Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia.
\v 10 There are some from Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt, and the regions in Libya
\add that are\add* near Cyrene \add city\add*. \add There are others of
us\add* who are \add here\add* visiting \add Jerusalem\add* from Rome.
\v 11  \add They include native\add* Jews as well as non-Jews who have accepted what we Jews believe. And others of us are from
Crete \add Island\add* and from \add the region of\add* Arabia. \add So how is it that these
people\add* are speaking our languages \f + \ft metonymy \f*, telling us \add about\add* the great\f + \ft Or: the mighty things \f*
\add that\add* God has done?” 
\v 12 All \add those people\add* were amazed, and did not know what to think
\add about what was happening\add*. So they asked one another, “What does this mean?”
\v 13 But \add some\add* of them made fun of\f + \ft Or: laughed at \f* \add those who believed in
Jesus\add*. They said, “\add These people are talking like this because\add* they have drunk too much new wine!”
\s Acts 2:14-21 
\s Peter said that the prophet Joel foretold what the Holy Spirit would do.
\p
\v 14 So Peter stood up with the \add other\add* eleven \add apostles\add* and spoke loudly to the
\add crowd of\add* people, saying, “\add My\add* fellow Jews and you
\add others\add* who are staying in Jerusalem, listen to me, all of you, and I will explain to you what is happening!
\v 15  \add Some of\add* you think that \add we(exc) are drunk\add*, but we are not drunk. It is
\add only\add* nine o'clock in the morning, \add and people here never get drunk at this
time\add* in the day! 
\v 16 Instead, \add what has happened to us is\add* the \add miraculous\add* thing that the prophet Joel wrote about
\add long ago\add*. \add Joel wrote\add*: 
\p God says, 
\v 17 ‘During the last\f + \ft Or: final \f* days \add before I judge all people\add*, I will give my Spirit abundantly\f + \ft Or: generously \f* to people
\f + \ft synecdoche \f* everywhere. \add As a result\add*, your sons and daughters will tell
\add people\add* messages from me, the young men among you will see visions
\add from me\add*, and the old men among you will have dreams \add that I will give
them\add*. 
\v 18 During those days I will abundantly\f + \ft Or: generously \f* give my Spirit
\add even\add* to men and women believers \add who are\add* my slaves\f + \ft Or: servants \f*, so they can tell
\add people\add* messages from me. 
\v 19 I will cause amazing things to happen in the sky, and I will do miracles on the earth that will show
\add that I am powerful\add*. \add Here\add* on the earth \f + \ft chiasmus \f* I
\add will cause wars with\add* blood, fire and thick\f + \ft Or: dark \f* smoke \add everywhere\add*.
\v 20  \add In the sky\add* the sun will \add appear\add* dark \add to
people\add* and the moon \add will appear\add* red \add to them. Those things will
happen\add* before the important and splendid\f + \ft Or: amazing \f* day \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add when
I\add*, the Lord \add God, will come to judge everyone\add*. 
\v 21  \add Before that time\add*, all those who ask \add me\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*
\add to save them from the guilt of their sins\add* will be saved
{\add I\add*, the Lord, will save all those who ask \add me\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*
\add to save them from the guilt of their sins\add*.}’ ” 
\s Acts 2:22-24 
\s Peter said, “You killed Jesus but God caused him to live again.”
\p
\v 22  \add Peter continued\add*, “\add My fellow\add* Israelites, listen to me!
\add When\add* Jesus from Nazareth \add town lived\add* among you, God proved to you
\add that he had sent him\add* by enabling him to do many amazing miracles that showed that
\add he was from God\add*. You yourselves know \add that this is
true\add*. 
\v 23  \add Even though you knew that\add*, you put this man \add Jesus\add* into the hands of his enemies.
\add However\add*, God had already planned for that, and he knew all about it. Then you urged men \f + \ft synecdoche \f* who do not obey
\add God's\add* law to kill Jesus. They did that by nailing him to a cross.
\v 24 He suffered terribly \add when he died, but God\add* did not let him continue to be dead, because it was not possible for
him \f + \ft personification \f* to remain dead. God caused him to become alive again.”
\s Acts 2:25-28 
\s David foretold that the Messiah would rejoice about becoming alive again.
\p
\v 25 “\add Long ago King\add* David wrote \add what\add* the Messiah
\add said\add*, 
\p I knew \add that\add* you, Lord \add God, would always\add* near me. You are right beside \f + \ft metonymy \f* me, so I will not be afraid
of \add those who want to harm me\add*. 
\v 26 Because of that I \f + \ft synecdoche \f* joyfully praise \add you, O God\add*. And I am completely confident that
\add you(sg) will\add* ◄\add cause my body\add* to become alive \add again\add*\f + \ft Or:  \f*\add raise me from the
dead\add*►. 
\v 27 You will not allow my spirit to remain in the place where the dead are. You will not
\add even\add* let my body decay, \add because\add* I am devoted to you and always obey
\add you\add*. 
\v 28 You have told me \add that you will cause my body\add* to become alive
\add again\add*. You will make me very happy \add because\add* you will be with me
\add forever\add*.” 
\s Acts 2:29-31 
\s Peter explained that David wrote that the Messiah would become alive again.
\p
\v 29  \add Peter\add* continued, “My fellow Jews, I can tell you confidently that
\add our royal\add* ancestor, \add King\add* David, died, and that his
\add body\add* was buried {that \add people\add* buried his \add body\add*}. And the place
\add where they\add* buried his body is \add still\add* here today.
\v 30 So \add we(inc) know that David was not speaking those words about himself.
But\add* because he was a prophet, \add he spoke about the Messiah\add*. David knew that God had strongly promised him that he
would cause one of his descendants to become king \f + \ft metonymy \f* like David was king. \f + \ft Or: to
\add be the Messiah who would\add* rule \add God's people\add* like David had ruled
\add them\add*.) 
\v 31 David knew beforehand \add what God would do\add*, so he \add was able
to\add* say that God would cause the Messiah to live again \add after he
died\add*. He said that God would not let the Messiah remain in the place of the dead, nor let his body decay.”
\s Acts 2:32-35 
\s Peter said, “Jesus has abundantly given us the Holy Spirit, shown by what you see and hear.”
\p
\v 32 “\add After\add* this \add man\add* Jesus \add had died\add*, God caused him to become alive
\add again\add*. All of us(exc), \add his followers\add*, have seen
\add and tell people\add* that Jesus has become alive again. 
\v 33 God has greatly honored Jesus \add by causing him to rule\add* right beside him \f + \ft metonymy \f*
\add in heaven\add*. Jesus has received the Holy Spirit from \add God\add* his Father,
\add just like\add* God promised. \add So\add* Jesus has generously\f + \ft Or: abundantly \f* given us the Holy Spirit,
\add and he has shown that by\add* what you are seeing and hearing.
\v 34  \add We(inc) know that David was not speaking about himself\add* because David did not go up into heaven
\add as Jesus did\add*. \add Besides that\add*, David himself said
\add this about the Messiah\add*: 
\q The Lord \add God\add* said to my Lord \add the Messiah\add*, ‘Reign here beside me,
\v 35 while I completely defeat \f + \ft metonymy \f* your enemies.’ ” 
\s Acts 2:36 
\s Peter said, “Know surely that God has made this Jesus both Lord and Messiah.”
\p
\v 36  \add Peter concluded\add*, “So I \add want you and\add* all
\add other\add* Israelites \f + \ft metonymy \f* to acknowledge that God has caused this Jesus to be both
\add our\add* Lord\f + \ft Or: Ruler \f* and the Messiah. \add But God considers
that\add* you are the ones who nailed Jesus to a cross.” 
\s Acts 2:37-40 
\s Peter told them to repent, and said that believers would baptize them.
\p
\v 37 When the people heard what \add Peter's said\add*, they felt very guilty \f + \ft idiom \f*. So they asked him and the other apostles,
“Fellow-countrymen, what should we\add (exc)\add* do \add so that God will forgive
us\add*?” 
\p
\v 38 Peter \add answered\add* them, “Each of you should turn away from your sinful behavior. Then
\add we(exc \f*\add* will baptize you, if \add you now believe\add* in Jesus Christ. Then
\add God\add* will give you the Holy Spirit. 
\v 39  \add God\add* has promised \add to do that\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* for you and your descendants, and for all
\add others who believe in him\add*, even those who \add live\add* far away
\add from here\add*. The Lord our God \add will give his Spirit\add* to everyone whom he invites
\add to become his people\add*!” 
\v 40 Peter spoke much more \add and\add* spoke strongly\f + \ft Or: forcefully \f* to them. He pleaded with them,
“\add Ask God\add* to save you \add so that he will not punish you when he
punishes\add* these evil people \add who have rejected Jesus\add*!”
\s Acts 2:41-42 
\s Many people became believers and joined the other believers. 
\p
\v 41 So the people who believed Peter's message were baptized. There were about three thousand
\add of those\add* \f + \ft synecdoche \f* \add who\add* joined the group \add of believers\add* that day.
\v 42 They continually obeyed what the apostles taught, and they very frequently met together
\add with the other believers\add*. And they continually ate \add together and celebrated the Lord's
Supper\add*, and continually prayed \add together\add*. 
\s Acts 2:43-47 
\s The apostles worked miracles, all the believers shared everything, and the Lord helped them.
\p
\v 43 All the people \f + \ft synecdoche \f* \add who were in Jerusalem\add* were greatly reverencing
\add God because\add* the apostles were frequently doing many kinds of miraculous things.
\v 44 All of those who believed \add in Jesus\add* were united \add and regularly
met\add* together. They were also sharing everything that they had with one another.
\v 45  \add From time to time some of\add* them sold \add some of\add* their land and
\add some of the other\add* things that they owned, and they would give
\add some of\add* the money \add from what they sold\add* to others
\add among them\add*, according to what they needed. 
\v 46 Every day they continued meeting together in the temple \add area\add*. And every day they gladly and generously shared
their food \f + \ft synecdoche \f* \add with each other\add*, as they ate together
\add and celebrated the Lord's Supper\add* in their houses. 
\v 47  \add As they did so\add*, they were praising God, and all the
\add other\add* people \add in Jerusalem\add* were \add thinking\add* favorably about them.
\add As those things were happening\add*, every day the Lord \add Jesus\add* increased the number of people who were being
saved {whom he was saving} \add from the guilt of their sins\add*.
