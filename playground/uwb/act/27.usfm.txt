\c 27  
\s Acts 27:1-8 
\s Paul and other prisoners sailed from Caesarea to Crete. 
\p
\v 1 When \add the Governor and those who advised him\add* decided that it was time for
us\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* to get on a ship and go to Italy, they put Paul and some other prisoners into the hands\f + \ft Or: care \f* of an army
captain whose name was Julius. \add He was the one who would guard us on the
journey\add*. Julius was \add an officer\add* in charge of \add a group
of\add* a hundred \add soldiers that people called\add* 'the Emperor Augustus Group.'
\v 2 So we got on a ship that had come from Adramyttium \add city in Asia province. The
ship\add* was going to \add return there, stopping at\add* cities along the coast of Asia
\add province\add*. Aristarchus, \add a fellow believer who was\add* from Thessalonica
\add city\add* in Macedonia \add province\add*, went with us. 
\v 3 The day after \add the ship sailed\add*, we arrived at Sidon
\add city\add*. Julius kindly told Paul that he could go and see his friends
\add who lived there\add*, so that they could give him whatever he might need.
\add So Paul visited the believers there\add*. 
\v 4 Then the ship left \add Sidon\add*, but the winds were blowing against
us\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add*, so \add the ship\add* went along \add the north\add* side of Cyprus
\add Island\add*, the side that is sheltered \add from the wind\add*.
\v 5 After that, we crossed over the sea close to the coast of Cilicia and Pamphylia
\add provinces. The ship\add* arrived at Myra \add city, which is\add* in Lycia
\add province\add*. \add We got off the ship there\add*. 
\v 6 In Myra, \add people told\add* Julius that a ship \add was there that had
come\add* from Alexandria \add city\add* and would \add soon\add* sail to Italy. So he arranged for us to get
\add on that ship\add*, \add and we left\add*. 
\v 7 We sailed slowly for several days and finally arrived close to the coast
\add of Asia province\add*, near Cnidus \add town. After that\add*, the wind
\add was very strong and\add* did not allow the ship to move straight ahead
\add westward. So instead\add*, we sailed \add southward\add* along the side of Crete
\add Island that is\add* sheltered \add from the wind\add*, and we passed
\add near Cape\add* Salmone. 
\v 8  \add The wind was still strong, and it prevented the ship from moving ahead
fast\add*. So we moved slowly along the coast \add of Crete\add*, and we arrived at a harbor that was called Fair Havens, near
Lasea town. 
\s Acts 27:9-20 
\s Paul warned them not to travel on, but the ship's officials decided to go on anyway.
\p
\v 9 Much time had passed, so it would have been dangerous if we\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* had traveled
\add farther\add* by ship \add because after that time of the year\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*
\add the sea often became very stormy\add*. So Paul said to the men
\add on the ship\add*, 
\v 10 "Men, I perceive that \add if we\f + \ft inclusive \f* travel by ship\add* now, it will be disastrous for us. A storm may destroy the ship
and the cargo, and possibly we will drown." 
\v 11 But the officer \add did not listen to\add* what Paul said. Instead, he decided to do what the pilot
\add of the ship\add* and the owner of the ship advised. 
\v 12 The harbor where the ship had stopped was not a good place to remain during the winter
\add when the weather frequently becomes stormy. So most of the people on the ship decided that we\f + \ft exclusive \f* should leave there,
because they hoped that we\add* could stay at Phoenix \add port\add* during the winter, if we could possibly arrive there. That
harbor was open to the sea in two directions, \add but the strong winds did not blow
there\add*. 
\v 13 Then a gentle wind began to blow \add from the south\add*, and the
\add crew members\add* thought that they could travel as they had decided
\add to do. So\add* they lifted \add the anchor up out of the sea\add*, and the ship sailed
\add westward\add* along the \add southern\add* shore of Crete \add Island\add*.
\v 14 But after a while, a wind that was very strong blew across the island
\add from the north side and hit the ship. That wind was called\add*
{\add People\add* called that wind} "the Northeast Wind." 
\v 15 It blew strongly against the \add front of\add* the ship. The result was that we could not keep going in the direction
\add in which we had been going\add*. So the sailors let the wind move the ship in the direction
\add that the wind\add* was blowing. 
\v 16 The ship then passed a small island named Cauda. We passed along the side
\add of the island that\add* sheltered \add the ship from the wind\add*. Then
\add while the ship was moving along\add*, the sailors lifted the lifeboat up
\add out of the water\add* and tied it \add on the deck. But the strong wind made
it\add* difficult even to do that. 
\v 17-18 After the sailors \add hoisted\f + \ft Or: lifted \f*\add* the lifeboat onto the ship, they tied ropes around the ship's hull to
strengthen the ship. The sailors were afraid that, \add because the wind was pushing the
ship\add*, it might run onto the sandbanks off the coast of Libya to the south
\add and get stuck there. So\add* they lowered the largest sail \add so that the ship would move slower. Even
so\add*, the wind continued to move the ship along. \add The wind and the
waves\add* continued to toss the ship about roughly, so on the next day the sailors began to throw overboard the things that
the ship was carrying. 
\v 19 On the third \add day after the stormy wind had begun to blow\add*, the sailors\f + \ft Or: we \f* \f + \ft metonymy \f* threw overboard
\add most of\add* the sails, ropes, and poles, \add in order to make the ship
lighter\add*. 
\v 20 The wind continued to blow very strongly, \add and the sky was full of dark
clouds\add* day and night. We could not see the sun or the stars for many days,
\add so we could not determine where we were. And the wind\add* continued to blow violently. So
we\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* finally thought that we would drown in the sea.
\s Acts 27:21-26 
\s Paul told them that an angel from God said that they would all survive.
\p
\v 21 None of us on the ship had eaten for many days. \add Then one
day\add*, Paul stood up in front of us and said, "\add Friends\add*, you should have listened to me
\add when I said\add* that we\add \f + \ft inclusive \f*\add* should not sail from Crete. Then we would have been safe, and the ship and its
cargo would be in good condition \f + \ft litotes \f*. 
\v 22 But now, I urge you, do not be afraid, because none of us will die.
\add The storm\add* will destroy the ship but not us. 
\v 23 I \add know this\add*, because last night God, the one to whom I belong and whom I serve,
\add sent\add* an angel \add who came and\add* stood by me. 
\v 24 The angel said to me, 'Paul, do not be afraid! You\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* must
\add go to Rome\add* and stand before the Emperor there \add so that he can judge
you\add*. I want you to know that God has granted to you \add that\add* all those who are traveling by ship with you
\add will also survive\add*.' 
\v 25 So cheer up, \add my\add* friends, because I believe that God will make this happen, exactly as
\add the angel\add* told me. 
\v 26 However, \add the ship\add* will crash on some island, \add and\add*
we\add \f + \ft inclusive \f*\add* will go ashore \add there\add*." 
\s Acts 27:27-32 
\s Paul thwarted some sailors who tried to sneak ashore in the lifeboat.
\p
\v 27 On the fourteenth night \add after the storm had begun, the
ship\add* was still being blown {the wind was still blowing \add the
ship\add*} across the Adriatic sea. About midnight, the sailors sensed that the ship was getting close to land.
\v 28 So they lowered \add a rope\add* to measure how deep \add the water
was\add*. When they pulled the rope up again, they measured it and saw that the water was 120 ft.\f + \ft Or: 37 meters \f* deep. They went a
little farther and lowered the rope again. \add That time\add*, they saw that the water was
\add only\add* about 90 ft.\f + \ft Or: 28 meters \f* deep. 
\v 29 They were afraid that the \add ship\add* might go onto some rocks, so they threw out four anchors from the
\add ship's\add* stern\f + \ft Or: back \f* and continued to wish\f + \ft Or: pray \f* that it would soon be dawn
\add so that they could see where the ship was going\add*. 
\v 30 Some of the sailors were planning to escape from the ship, so they lowered the lifeboat into the sea. In order
\add that no one would know what they planned to do\add*, they pretended
\add that\add* they wanted to lower some anchors from the \add ship's\add* front\f + \ft Or: bow \f*.
\v 31 But Paul said to the army officer and soldiers, "If the sailors do not stay in the ship, you have no hope of being
saved." 
\v 32 So the soldiers cut the ropes and let the lifeboat fall into the water.
\s Acts 27:33-38 
\s Paul urged them to eat some food, so they did and then lightened the ship.
\p
\v 33 Just before dawn, Paul urged everyone\add on the ship\add* to eat some food. He said, "For the past fourteen days you
have been waiting and watching and not eating anything. 
\v 34 So, \add now\add* I urge you to eat some food. We\add \f + \ft inclusive \f*\add* need to do that in order to stay alive. I
\add tell you to do that because I know that\add* none of you will drown \f + \ft idiom \f*."
\v 35 After Paul had said that, while everyone was watching, he took some bread and thanked God
\add for it. Then he broke the bread and began to eat some of it\add*.
\v 36 The \add rest of us\add* became encouraged, so we\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* all ate some food.
\v 37 Altogether there were 276 of us \f + \ft synecdoche \f* on the ship. 
\v 38 When everyone had eaten as much as they wanted, they threw the grain
\add that the ship was carrying\add* into the sea, and this made the ship lighter.
\s Acts 27:39-41 
\s The waves began to break up the ship after it struck a shoal.
\p
\v 39 At dawn, \add we\f + \ft exclusive \f* could see\add* land, \add but the sailors\add* did not recognize
\add the place\add*. However, they could see that there was a bay and
\add a wide area of\add* sand at the water's edge. They planned that, if it was possible, they would steer the ship onto
\add the beach\add*. 
\v 40  \add So some of the sailors\add* cut the anchor \add ropes
and\add* let the anchors fall into the sea. At the same time, \add other
sailors\add* untied the \add ropes that\add* fastened the rudders,
\add so that they could steer the ship again\add*. Then \add the
sailors\add* raised the sail at the front\f + \ft Or: bow \f* of the ship so that the wind
\add would blow the ship forward\add*, and the ship headed towards the shore.
\v 41 But the ship hit a sandbank. The front of the ship stuck there and could not move, and big waves beat against the back of
the ship and it began to break apart. 
\s Acts 27:42-44 
\s The officer saved Paul and commanded all to go to the shore, so they did that.
\p
\v 42 The soldiers said \add to one another, "Let's\add* kill \add all\add* the prisoners
\add on the ship\add*, so that they will not \add be able to\add* swim
\add away and\add* escape." \add They planned to do that because they were
sure\add* that officials \add would order them to be executed if they let the prisoners
escape\add*. 
\v 43 But \add Julius\add*, the army captain, wanted to save Paul, so he stopped the soldiers from doing what they planned to
do. Instead, he \add commanded\add* first that everyone who could swim should jump into the water and swim to land.
\v 44  \add Then he told\add* the others \add to hold\add* on to planks or pieces from the ship
\add and go towards shore. We\f + \ft exclusive \f* did what he said, and\add* in that way all of us arrived safely on land.
