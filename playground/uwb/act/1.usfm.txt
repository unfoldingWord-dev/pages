\v 1  \add Dear\add* Theophilus, 
\p In my first book \add that I wrote for you\add*, I wrote about many of the things that Jesus did and taught
\v 2 until the day on which he was taken {\add God\add* took him} up
\add to heaven\add*. Before \add he went to heaven\add*, saying what the Holy Spirit
\add told him\add*, he told the apostles whom he had chosen \add the things that he wanted them to
know\add*. 
\v 3 After he had suffered \add and died on the cross\add*, \add he became alive
again\add*. As he appeared to them \add often\add* during \add the
next\add* forty days, the apostles saw him many times. He proved to them in many ways that he was alive again. He talked
\add with them\add* about \add how\add* God would rule \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add the lives of people who accepted him as their
king\add*. 
\s Acts 1:4-5 
\s Jesus commanded his apostles to wait for the Holy Spirit. 
\p
\v 4  \add One time\add* while he was with them, he told them, "Do not leave Jerusalem
\add yet\add*. Instead, wait \add here\add* until my Father sends
\add his Spirit\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add to you\add*, as he promised \add to
do\add*. You have heard me speak \add to you\add* about that. 
\v 5 John baptized people in water\add because they said that they wanted to change their
lives\add*, but after a few days \f + \ft litotes \f* \add God\add* will put the Holy Spirit within you
\add to truly change your lives\add*." 
\s Acts 1:6-9 
\s Jesus said that they would tell about him everywhere, and then he ascended to heaven.
\p
\v 6 One day when the \add apostles\add* met together \add with Jesus\add*, they asked him, "Lord, will
you\add (sg)\add* now become the King \f + \ft metaphor \f* over \add us\add* Israelite people
\add like King David, who ruled long ago\add*?" \f + \ft Or: "Lord, will
you\add (sg \f*\add* now \add defeat the Romans and\add* restore the kingdom
\add to us\add* Israelite people?") 
\v 7 He replied to them, "You do not \add need\add* to know the time
\add periods\add* and days \add when that will happen\add*. My Father alone has decided
\add when he will make me king\add*. 
\v 8 But \add you do need to know that\add* the Holy Spirit will make you
\add spiritually\add* strong when he comes to live in you. Then you will
\add powerfully\add* tell people about me in Jerusalem and in all
\add the other places in\add* Judea \add district\add*, in Samaria
\add district\add*, and in places far away all over \f + \ft idiom \f* the world."
\v 9 After he said that, he was taken {\add God\add* took him} up
\add to heaven\add*, while they were watching. \add He went up into\add* a cloud \f + \ft personification \f*, which prevented them from seeing him
\add anymore\add*. 
\s Acts 1:10-11 
\s Angels told the apostles that Jesus would return later. 
\p
\v 10 While \add the apostles\add* were \add still\add* staring towards the sky as he was going up, suddenly two men who were
wearing white clothes stood beside them. \add They were angels\add*.
\v 11 One\add of\add* them said, "You men from Galilee \add district\add*, you do not need to stand
\add here any longer\add* looking up at the sky!\f + \ft Or: why do you still stand
\add here\add* looking up at the sky? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add Some day\add* this same Jesus, whom
\add God\add* took from you up to heaven, will come back \add to
earth\add*. He will return in the same manner as you \add just now\add* saw him when he went up to heaven,
\add but he will not return now\add*." 
\s Acts 1:12-14 
\s The apostles and other believers often prayed together. 
\p
\v 12 Then \add after the two angels left\add*, the apostles returned to Jerusalem from Olive
\add Tree\add* Hill, which was about a half mile\f + \ft Or: one kilometer \f* \f + \ft metonymy \f* from Jerusalem.
\v 13 When they entered \add the city\add*, they went into the upstairs room
\add in the house\add* where they were staying. \add Those who were there
included\add* Peter, John, James, Andrew, Philip, Thomas, Bartholomew, Matthew,
\add another\add* James \add the son\add* of Alphaeus, Simon who belonged to the group that wanted to expel the Romans, and
Judas \add the son\add* of \add another man named\add* James. 
\v 14 All these apostles agreed concerning the things about which they continually were praying
\add together. Others who prayed with them\add* included the women
\add who had accompanied Jesus\add*, Mary who was Jesus' mother, and his
\add younger\add* brothers. 
\s Acts 1:15-17 
\s Peter told them why someone must replace Judas. 
\p
\v 15 During those days Peter stood up among his fellow believers. There were
\add at that place\add* a group of about 120 of \add Jesus' followers\add*. He said,
\v 16 "My fellow believers, \add there are words that King\add* David wrote \f + \ft metonymy \f* in the Scriptures long ago that needed to be
fulfilled {to happen \add as he said they would\add*}. The Holy Spirit,
\add who knew that Judas would be the one who would fulfill those
words\add*, told David what to write. 
\v 17  \add Although\add* Judas had been chosen {\add Jesus\add* had chosen Judas}, along with
\add the rest of\add* us\add (exc)\add* to serve \add as an apostle\add*, Judas was the person who guided the people who seized
Jesus." 
\s Acts 1:18-19 
\s How Judas died. 
\p
\v 18  \add The Jewish leaders\add* gave Judas money when he \add promised
to\add* treacherously\f + \ft Or: wickedly \f* \add betray Jesus. Later Judas returned that money to
them\add*. When Judas \add hanged himself\add*, his body fell down
\add to the ground\add*. His abdomen burst open, and all his intestines spilled out.
\add So\add* the \add Jewish leaders\add* bought a field \add using\add* that money.
\v 19 All the people who reside in Jerusalem heard \add about that\add*, so they called that field according to their own
\add Aramaic\add* language, Akeldama, which means 'Field of Blood,'
\add because it was where someone bled and died\add*. 
\s Acts 1:20 
\s Peter quoted from the Psalms about Judas. 
\p
\v 20  \add Peter also said\add*, "\add I perceive that what happened to Judas is like what the writer
of\add* Psalms\add desired to happen\add*: 'May his house become deserted, and may there be no one to live in it.' \f + \ft Or:
'\add Judge him, Lord, so that neither he nor\add* anyone \add else\add* may live in his house! \f*' And it seems that
\add these other words that David wrote also refer to Judas:\add* 'Let someone else take over his work as a leader.'Â "
\s Acts 1:21-22 
\s Peter concluded that they needed to choose a man to replace Judas.
\p
\v 21 "So it is necessary \add for us apostles\add* to choose a man
\add to replace Judas. He must be one who\add* accompanied \f + \ft metonymy \f* us all the time when the Lord Jesus was with us.
\v 22  \add That would be\add* from \add the time when\add* John
\add the Baptizer\add* baptized \add Jesus\add* until the day when Jesus was taken {when
\add God\add* took Jesus} from us up \add to heaven\add*. He must be one who saw Jesus alive again
\add after he died\add*." 
\s Acts 1:23-26 
\s Jesus' followers prayed and then chose Matthias to replace Judas.
\p
\v 23 So the \add apostles and other believers\add* suggested \add the names of two men who qualified. One man
was\add* Joseph, who was called {whom people called} Barsabbas \f + \ft Or: Joseph Barsabbas \f* who
\add also\add* had the \add Roman\add* name Justus. The other man was Matthias.
\v 24-25 Then they prayed like this: "Lord \add Jesus\add*, Judas stopped being an apostle.
\add He died and\add* went to the place where he \add deserved to
be\add* \f + \ft euphemism \f*. \add So we(exc) need to choose someone\add* to replace
\add Judas in order\add* that he can serve \add you(sg) by becoming\add* an apostle.
You\add (sg)\add* know what everyone is really like. So \add please\add* show us which of these two men you have chosen."
\v 26 Then they cast lots \add to choose between the two of\add* them, and the lot fell for Matthias. \f + \ft Or: Then
\add one of\add* the \add apostles\add* shook \add in a container\add* small objects\f + \ft Or: stones \f*
\add that\add* they \add had marked to determine which man God had
chosen\add*. And the small object\f + \ft Or: stone \f* \add that they had marked\add* for Matthias fell
\add out of the container\add* \f*. So Matthias was considered {they considered Matthias}
\add to be an apostle\add* along with the \add other\add* eleven apostles.
