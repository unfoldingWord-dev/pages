\c 5  
\s Acts 5:1-2 
\s Ananias pretended to give the apostles all the money from selling a field.
\p
\v 1 But there was one of\add the believers\add* whose name was Ananias, and whose wife's name was Sapphira. He
\add also\add* sold some land. 
\v 2 He kept for himself some of the money \add he had received for the
land\add*, and his wife knew that he had done that. Then he brought the rest of the money and presented it to the apostles
\f + \fk metonymy \f*. 
\s Acts 5:3-6 
\s People were terrified when they saw or heard that Ananias had died.
\p
\v 3 Then Peter said, “Ananias, you\add (sg)\add* let Satan completely control you \f + \fk metonymy \f* so that
you\add (sg) tried to\add* deceive the Holy Spirit \add and us(exc)\add*. ◄That
was\add terrible!/Why did you do such a terrible thing\add*?► \f + \fk rhetorical question \f*
\add You\add* have kept for yourself some of the money you\add (sg)\add* received for
\add selling\add* the land, \add pretending that you(sg) were giving us all of
it\add*. 
\v 4 Before you\add (sg)\add* sold that land, you truly owned \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* it. And after you sold it, you could \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* certainly still
have used the money any way you wanted \add to\add*. So why did you\add (sg)
ever\add* think \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* about doing this \add wicked\add* thing? You were not
\add merely trying to\add* deceive us! No, \add you tried to deceive\add* God
\add himself!\add*” 
\v 5 When Ananias heard that, \add immediately\add* he fell down dead. So all
\add who were there\add* who heard \add about Ananias' death\add* became terrified \f + \fk personification \f*.
\v 6 Some young men came in, wrapped his \add body\add* \add with a
sheet\add*, and carried it out \add and\add* buried it. 
\s Acts 5:7-11 
\s Sapphira also died because she lied, and some men buried her beside her husband.
\p
\v 7 About three hours later, his wife came in\add , but\add* she did not know what had happened.
\v 8  \add As\add* Peter \add showed her the money\add* that\add Ananias had
brought\add*, he asked her, “Tell me, is this the amount \add of money you two received
for\add* the land you sold?” She said, “Yes, that's \add what we(exc)
received\add*.” 
\v 9 So Peter said to her, “\add You both did a terrible thing!\add* You two agreed \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* to try to determine if you could do
that without the Spirit of the Lord \add God\add* revealing \add to anyone that you two tried to deceive
them!\add* Listen! \add Do you(sg) hear the\add* footsteps \f + \fk synecdoche \f* of the men who buried your husband? They are right outside
this door, and they will carry your \add corpse\add* out \add to bury it,
too\add*!” 
\v 10 Immediately Sapphira fell down dead at Peter's feet. Then the young men came in. When they saw that she was dead, they
carried her \add body\add* out and buried it beside her husband's
\add body\add*. 
\p
\v 11 So all the believers \add in Jerusalem\add* became greatly frightened \f + \fk personification \f*
\add because of what God had done to Ananias and Sapphira. And\add* all
\add the others\add* who heard \add people tell about\add* those things also
\add became greatly frightened\add*. 
\s Acts 5:12-16 
\s The apostles healed many people, and many people believed in Jesus.
\p
\v 12  \add God was enabling\add* the apostles to do many amazing miracles among the people. All the believers were meeting
together regularly \add in the temple courtyard\add* at \add the place
called\add* Solomon's Porch. 
\v 13 All of the other people \add who had not yet believed in Jesus\add* were afraid to associate with the believers,
\add because they knew that if they did anything evil, God would punish them, as well as revealing it to the
believers\add*. However, those people continued to greatly respect the believers.
\v 14 Many more men and women started believing in the Lord \add Jesus\add*, and they joined the
\add group of\add* believers. 
\v 15  \add The apostles were doing amazing miracles\add*, so \add people\add* were bringing those who were sick into the
streets and laying them on stretchers and mats, in order that \add when\add* Peter came by
\add he would touch them, or\add* at least his shadow might come upon some of them
\add and heal them\add*. 
\v 16 Crowds of people were also coming \add to the apostles\add* from the towns near Jerusalem. They were bringing their sick
\add relatives/friends\add* and those who were being tormented/troubled by evil spirits {whom evil spirits were
tormenting/troubling}, and \add God\add* healed all of them. 
\s Acts 5:17-21a 
\s Jewish leaders jailed the apostles, but an angel freed them to teach people.
\p
\v 17 Then the high priest and all who were with him, who were members of the
\add local\add* Sadducee \add sect in Jerusalem\add*, became very jealous
\add of the apostles, because many people were accepting the apostles'
message\add*. 
\v 18 So they commanded the Temple guards to seize the apostles and put them in the public jail.
\v 19  \add The guards did that\add*, but during the night an angel from the Lord
\add God\add* opened the jail doors and brought the apostles outside!
\add The guards were not aware of what the angel had done\add*. 
\v 20 Then the angel said \add to the apostles\add*, “Go to the Temple
\add courtyard\add*, stand there, and tell the people all about \add how God can give them
eternal\add* life!” 
\v 21 So having heard this, about dawn they entered the Temple \add courtyard\add* and began to teach the people again
\add about Jesus\add*. 
\s Acts 5:21b-24 
\s The Jewish leaders were perplexed because the apostles were not in jail.
\p Meanwhile, the high priest and those who were with him summoned the other Jewish Council members. Altogether they made up
the entire Council of Israel. \add After they all gathered together\add*, they sent
\add guards\add* to the jail to bring in the apostles. 
\v 22 But when the guards arrived at the jail, they discovered that the apostles were not there. So they returned to the
Council, and \add one of\add* them reported, 
\v 23 “We\add (exc)\add* saw that the jail \add doors\add* were very securely locked, and the guards were standing at the
doors. But when we opened \add the doors and went in to get those
men\add*, none \add of them was\add* inside \add the jail\add*!”
\v 24 When the captain of the temple guards and the chief priests heard that, they became greatly
perplexed\add , wondering\add* what might result from all this. 
\s Acts 5:25-26 
\s After finding them, the leaders brought the apostles back to question them.
\p
\v 25 Then someone came \add from the Temple courtyard\add* and \add excitedly\add* reported to them, “Listen
\add to this! Right now\add* the men whom you put in jail are standing in the Temple
\add courtyard\add* and they are teaching the people \add about Jesus\add*!”
\v 26 So the captain \add of the Temple guards\add* went \add to the Temple
courtyard\add* with the officers, and they brought the apostles \add back to the Council room. But
they\add* did not treat them roughly, because they were afraid that the people would
\add kill them by\add* throwing stones at them \add if they hurt the
apostles\add*. 
\s Acts 5:27-33 
\s Peter and the other apostles said that they must obey God. 
\p
\v 27 After \add the captain and his officers\add* had brought \add the apostles to the Council
room\add*, they commanded them to stand in front of the Council members, and the high priest questioned them.
\v 28 He said to them\add accusingly\add*, “We\add (exc)\add* strongly commanded you not to teach people about that man \f + \fk metonymy \f*
\add Jesus\add*! But \add you have disobeyed us, and\add* you have taught people all over Jerusalem
\add about him!\add* Furthermore, you are trying to make it seem that
we\add (exc)\add* are the ones who are guilty \f + \fk metonymy \f* for that man's death!”
\v 29 But Peter, \add speaking for himself\add* and the other apostles, replied,
“We\add (exc)\add* have to obey \add what\add* God \add commands us to
do\add*, not what \add you\add* people \add tell us to do\add*! 
\v 30 God considers that you are the ones who killed Jesus by nailing him to a cross! But God, whom our ancestors
\add worshipped\add*, ◄caused Jesus to become alive again after he died/raised Jesus from the dead►.
\v 31 God has greatly honored Jesus. \add He has taken him up to heaven! He has authorized
him\add* to be the one who will save us and to rule \add over our lives! God did
this\add* so that he might enable \add us\add* Israelites \f + \fk metonymy \f* to turn away from
\add our\add* sinful behavior and \add that he might\add* forgive
\add us for our sins\add*. 
\v 32 We\add (exc)\add* tell people about these things \add that we know happened to
Jesus\add*, and the Holy Spirit, whom God has sent to \add us\add* who obey him, is also confirming
\add that these things are true\add*.” 
\v 33 When the Council members heard those words, they became very angry
\add with the apostles\add*, and they wanted to kill them. 
\s Acts 5:34-40 
\s After beating the apostles, they followed Gamaliel's advice and released them.
\p
\v 34 But \add there was a Council member\add* named Gamaliel. He was a Pharisee, and one who taught people the
\add Jewish\add* laws, and all the \add Jewish\add* people respected him. He stood up in the Council and told
\add guards\add* to take the apostles out \add of the room\add* for a short time.
\v 35  \add After the guards had taken the apostles out\add*, he said to the other Council members, “Fellow Israelites, you
need to think carefully about what you want to do to these men, \add and I will tell you
why\add*. 
\v 36 Some years ago \add a man named\add* Theudas rebelled \add against the Roman
government\add*. He told people that he was an important person, and about four hundred men joined
\add him. But he was killed\add* {\add soldiers\add* killed him} and all those who had been accompanying him were scattered.
\add So they\add* were not able to do anything \add that they had
planned\add*. 
\v 37 After that, during the time when they were ◄writing down names of the people/taking the census►
\add in order to tax people, a man named\add* Judas from Galilee
\add province\add* rebelled \add against the Roman government\add*. He persuaded some people to accompany him. But
\add soldiers\add* killed him, too, and all those who had accompanied him went off in different directions.
\v 38 So now I say \add this\add* to you: Do not harm these men! Release them! I say this because if
\add this is just something\add* that humans have planned, they will not be able to do it. They will fail,
\add like Theudas and Judas did\add*! 
\v 39 But, if God \add has commanded them to do it\add*, you will not be able to prevent them
\add from doing it, because\add* you will find out that you are opposing God!” The other members of the Council accepted what
Gamaliel said. 
\v 40 They told the \add temple guards to bring the apostles and beat/flog them. So the
guards\add* brought them \add into the Council room\add* and beat/flogged them. Then the Council members commanded them not to
speak to people about \f + \fk metonymy \f* Jesus, and they released the apostles.
\s Acts 5:41-42 
\s The apostles rejoiced and continued to tell others about Jesus.
\p
\v 41 So the apostles went out from the Council. They were rejoicing, because
\add they knew God\add* had honored them \add by letting people\add* disgrace them because they were followers \f + \fk metonymy \f* of Jesus.
\v 42 And every day \add the apostles went to\add* the temple \add area\add* and to various
\add people's\add* houses, \add and\add* they continued \f + \fk litotes \f* teaching
\add people\add* and telling \add them\add* that Jesus is the Messiah.
