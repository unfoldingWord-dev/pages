\s Acts 12:1-4 
\s Herod had James killed and Peter put in prison. 
\p
\v 1 It was about this time that King Herod \add Agrippa sent soldiers\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* who seized
\add and put in prison\add* some of the \add leaders\add* of the congregation
\add in Jerusalem. He did that\add* because he wanted to make the believers suffer.
\v 2 He commanded \add a soldier\add* to cut off the head of \add the
apostle\add* James, the \add older\add* brother of \add the apostle\add* John.
\v 3 When Herod realized that he had pleased the \add leaders of
the\add* Jewish people by \add doing that\add*, he commanded \add soldiers\add* to arrest Peter
\add in order to kill him\add*, too. This happened during the festival
\add when the Jewish people ate\add* bread \add that\add* did not have yeast.
\v 4 After \add they\add* seized Peter, they put him in prison. They arranged for four groups of soldiers to guard Peter. Each
\add group\add* had four soldiers. \add Every three hours a different group began to guard him while the others
rested\add*. Herod wanted to bring Peter out \add of prison and judge
him\add* in front of the \add Jewish\add* people after the Passover\add Festival was finished. He then planned to command
soldiers to execute Peter\add*. 
\s Acts 12:5-11 
\s An angel freed Peter from prison. 
\p
\v 5 So \add for several days\add* Peter was kept {they kept Peter} in prison. But the
\add other believers\add* in the congregation at \add Jerusalem\add* were praying earnestly to God
\add that he would help\add* Peter. 
\v 6 The night \add before\add* Herod planned to bring Peter out
\add from prison to have him executed\add* publicly, Peter was sleeping
\add in the prison\add* between two soldiers, with two chains binding his arms
\add to the arms of the soldiers. Two other\add* soldiers were guarding the prison doors.
\v 7 Suddenly an angel \add from\add* the Lord \add God\add* stood
\add beside Peter\add*, and a \add bright\add* light shone in his cell. The angel poked Peter in the side and woke him up and
said, "Get up quickly!" \add While Peter was getting up\add*, the chains fell off from his wrists.
\add However, the soldiers were not aware of what was happening\add*.
\v 8 Then the angel said to him, "Put on your clothes and sandals!" So Peter did. Then the angel said to him, "Fasten your
belt\f + \ft Or: girdle \f* \add around you\f + \ft singular \f*\add* and put on your sandals!" So Peter did that. Then the angel told him, "Wrap your cloak
around you and follow me!" 
\v 9 So, \add after Peter put on his cloak and sandals\add*, he followed
\add the angel\add* out \add of the prison cell\add*, but he had no idea that what the angel was doing was really happening. He
thought \add that he\add* was seeing a vision. 
\v 10 Peter and the angel walked by the soldiers who were guarding the two
doors\add , but the soldiers did not see them. Then\add* they came to the iron gate
that\add led\add* out into the city. The gate opened by itself, and Peter and the angel walked out
\add of the prison\add*. After they had walked \add a ways\add* along one street, the angel suddenly disappeared.
\v 11 Then Peter \add finally\add* realized that \add what had\add*
\add happened to him was not a vision, but\add* it had really happened. So he said
\add to himself\add*, "Now I really know that the Lord \add God\add* sent an angel
\add to help me\add*. He rescued me from what Herod planned to do \f + \ft metonymy \f*
\add to me\add* and \add also\add* from all the things that the Jewish
\add leaders\add* \f + \ft synecdoche \f* expected \add that Herod would do to me\add*."
\s Acts 12:12-17 
\s Peter reported to the other believers. 
\p
\v 12 When Peter realized \add that God had rescued him\add*, he went to Mary's house. She was the mother of John whose other
name was Mark. Many \add believers\add* had assembled there, and they were praying
\add that God would help Peter somehow\add*. 
\v 13 When Peter knocked at the outer entrance, a servant girl named Rhoda came to find out
\add who was outside the door\add*. 
\v 14  \add When Peter answered her\add*, she recognized his voice, but she was so happy
\add and excited\add* that she did not open the door! Instead, she ran back
\add into the house\add*. She \add excitedly\add* announced \add to the other
believers\add* that Peter was standing outside the door. 
\v 15 But \add one of\add* them said to her, "You\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* are crazy!" But she continued saying that it was
\add really true. Then\add* they repeatedly said, "\add No\add*,
\add it cannot be Peter\add*. It is \add probably\add* the angel
\add who was guarding\add* him\add who has come\add* \f + \ft Or: It is the angel
\add who has guarded\f + \ft Or: protected \f*\add* him, \add and he has come to tell us
that\add* Peter \add has died\add*. \f*" 
\v 16 But Peter continued knocking \add on the door. So when someone
finally\add* opened the door, they saw that it was Peter, and they were completely amazed!
\v 17 Peter motioned with his hand for them to be quiet. Then he told them exactly how the Lord
\add God\add* had led him out of the prison. He \add also\add* said, "Tell James, the
\add leader\add* of our \add congregation\add*, and our \add other\add* fellow believers what has happened." Then
\add Peter\add* \add left and\add* went away to another town. 
\s Acts 12:18-19 
\s Herod commanded soldiers to execute the guards. 
\p
\v 18 The next morning the soldiers \add who had been guarding\add* Peter became terribly distressed,
\add because they did not know\add* what had happened to him. 
\v 19 Then Herod \add heard about it\add*. So he \add commanded soldiers\add* to search for Peter, but they did not find him.
Then he questioned the soldiers \add who had been guarding Peter\add*, and asked them,
"\add How did Peter get away when you were there guarding him?\add*"
\add But they could not explain it. So\add* he commanded them to be led away
\add to be executed\add* {\add other soldiers\add* to lead them away
\add to execute them\add*}. \add Afterwards\add*, Herod went from Judea
\add province\add* down to Caesarea \add city\add*, where he stayed
\add for some time\add*. 
\s Acts 12:20-23 
\s An angel caused Herod to die. 
\p
\v 20 King Herod had been furiously angry with the people \add who
lived\add* in Tyre and Sidon \add cities. Then\add* one day some men
\add who represented them\add* came unitedly \add to Caesarea in order to meet
with\add* Herod. They persuaded Blastus, who was one of Herod's important officials, to tell
\add Herod\add* that the people \add in their cities\add* wanted to make peace
\add with him. They wanted to be able to trade with the people that Herod
ruled\add*, because they needed to buy food from those regions. \add Herod had commanded the people in the areas he ruled to
stop selling food to the people in those cities\add*. 
\v 21 On the day that Herod had planned to\add meet with them\add*, he put on very expensive clothes that showed that he was
king\f + \ft Or: his royal robes \f*. Then he sat on his throne\f + \ft Or: chair from which he ruled
\add people\add* \f*, and \add formally\add* addressed \add all\add* the people
\add who had gathered there\add*. 
\v 22 Those who \add were listening to him\add* shouted repeatedly,
"\add This man who\add* is speaking is a god, not a man!" 
\v 23 So, because Herod \add let the people praise him\add* instead of praising God, immediately an angel
\add from\add* the Lord \add God\add* caused Herod to become seriously ill
\add . Many\add* worms ate his intestines, and \add soon\add* he died
\add very painfully\add*. 
\s Acts 12:24-25 
\s Many people heard God's message and became believers. Barnabas and Saul returned to Antioch from Jerusalem.
\p
\v 24  \add The believers\add* continued telling God's message to people in many places, and
\add the number of people who believed in Jesus\add* was continually increasing\f + \ft Or: there were continually more and more people
who were believing in Jesus \f*. 
\p
\v 25 When Barnabas and Saul finished \add delivering the money to help the Jewish believers in
Judea\add*, they left Jerusalem and returned \add to Antioch city, in Syria
province\add*. They took John, whose other name was Mark, with them.
