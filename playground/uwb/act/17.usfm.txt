\s Acts 17:1-4 
\s In Thessalonica, Paul convinced many people that Jesus is the Messiah.
\p
\v 1 Paul and Silas traveled through Amphipolis and Apollonia \add towns\add* and arrived at Thessalonica
\add city\add*. There was a Jewish meeting place there. 
\v 2 On the Sabbath\f + \ft Or: On the Jewish rest day \f* Paul went into the meeting house, as he usually did. For three weeks
\add he went there\add* on each Jewish day of rest. Referring to the Scriptures
\add about the Messiah\add*, he spoke to the people who were there.
\v 3 He explained and showed that \add the prophets wrote that\add* the Messiah needed to die and to become alive again\f + \ft Or: to be
raised from the dead \add afterwards\add* \f*. He told them: "This man Jesus, whom I am telling you about, is our Messiah.
\add He died and became alive again, just like the prophets predicted\add*."
\v 4 Some of the Jews \add there\add* were persuaded by {believed}
\add what Paul had said\add* and began to associate with Paul and Silas. There were also many non-Jewish people there who
worshipped God and many important women \add who also believed the message about
Jesus\add*, and they began to associate with Paul and Silas. 
\s Acts 17:5-9 
\s Some Jews there incited people to oppose Paul and Silas. 
\p
\v 5 But \add some leaders of\add* the Jews there in Thessalonica became jealous
\add because many people believed what Paul taught\add*. So they went to the public square and persuaded some lazy men
\add who were loitering there\add* to follow them. \add In this way, the leaders
of\add* the Jews gathered a crowd and incited them to become noisy and start a riot
\add against Paul and Silas\add*. Those \add Jews and others\add* ran to the house of
\add a man named\add* Jason. \add He was the man who had invited Paul and Silas to stay at his
house\add*. They wanted to bring Paul and Silas outside to where the crowd
\add of people was waiting\add*. 
\v 6 They discovered that Paul and Silas were not there, but they found Jason
\add and grabbed him\add*. They dragged him and some of the \add other\add* believers to where the city officials\f + \ft Or: authorities \f*
and \add many other people were gathered\add*. The men \add who had brought
Jason\add* shouted, "Those \add two\add* men have caused trouble \f + \ft idiom \f* everywhere \f + \ft hyperbole \f*
\add they have gone\add*. Now they have come to our city, 
\v 7 and \add this fellow\add* Jason invited them to stay at his house. All the people
\add of this sect\add* oppose what our Emperor has decreed. They say that another person, whose name is Jesus, is
\add the real\add* king!" 
\v 8 When the crowd of people \add that had gathered\add* and the city authorities heard that, they became very angry and
excited. 
\v 9  \add They wanted to put the believers in jail. But instead\add*, the officials made Jason and the other
\add believers\add* pay a fine and told them that they \add would give the money back to them if Paul and Silas did not cause
any more trouble\add*. Then the authorities let Jason and those other believers go.
\s Acts 17:10-12 
\s In Berea, Paul helped many Jews and non-Jews to believe in Jesus.
\p
\v 10  \add So\add* that same night, the believers sent Paul and Silas
\add out of Thessalonica\add* to Berea \add town\add*. When Paul and Silas arrived there, they went to the Jewish meeting
place, \add on a day when people had gathered there\add*. 
\v 11 The \add Jews\add* in Thessalonica had not been very willing to listen to God's message, but the
\add Jews\add* who lived in Berea were very willing to listen, so they listened very eagerly to the message
\add about Jesus\add*. Every day they read the Scriptures \add for
themselves\add* to find out if what Paul said \add about the Messiah\add* was true.
\v 12 As a result, many of the Jewish people believed \add in Jesus\add*, and also some of the important non-Jewish women and
many non-Jewish men \add believed in him\add*. 
\s Acts 17:13-15 
\s Jews from Thessalonica incited people to oppose Paul. 
\p
\v 13 But then the Jews in Thessalonica heard \add people tell them\add* that Paul
\add was\add* in Berea and that he was preaching the message from God
\add about Jesus\add*. So they went to Berea and \add told people there that what Paul was teaching was not true.
Thus\add*, they caused many of those people to get angry \add at
Paul\add*. 
\v 14 So \add several of\add* the believers \add in Berea\add* took Paul to the coast
\add to go to another province\add*. But Silas and Timothy stayed in Berea.
\v 15 When Paul and the other men \add arrived at the coast, they got on a ship
and\add* went to Athens \add city\add*. Then Paul said \add to the men who had come with
him\add*, "Tell Silas and Timothy to come to me \add here in Athens\add* as soon as they can." Then those men left
\add Athens and returned to Berea\add*. 
\s Acts 17:16-17 
\s In Athens, idols distressed Paul, so he talked to many people about Jesus.
\p
\v 16 In Athens, Paul waited for Silas and Timothy \add to arrive. In the meantime, he walked around in the city.
He\add* became very distressed\f + \ft Or: disturbed \f* because he saw that throughout \f + \ft hyperbole \f* the city there were many idols.
\v 17 So he went to the Jewish meeting place and talked \add about
Jesus\add* with the Jews, and also with the Greeks who had accepted what the Jews believe. He also went to the public
square\f + \ft Or: center \f* every day and talked to the people \add whom he met\add* there.
\s Acts 17:18 
\s When Paul talked about Jesus, he perplexed some teachers. 
\p
\v 18 Paul met some teachers who liked to talk about what people should believe.
\add People called\add* some of them Epicureans and \add they called\add* others Stoics. They told Paul
\add what they believed\add*, and they asked him \add what he believed.
Then\add* some of them said \add to one another\add*, "This ignorant person is just talking nonsense \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*!" Others said,
"\add We(exc) think\add* that he is teaching people about foreign
gods\f + \ft Or: \add new\add* gods that we\add (exc)\add* have not heard about \f*." They said that because Paul was telling them that Jesus
\add had died and\add* had become alive again \add afterwards. They had not heard that message
before\add*. 
\s Acts 17:19-21 
\s Athens Council members asked Paul to explain what he had been teaching.
\p
\v 19 So they took him to the place where the city council met. \add When they
arrived\add* there, they said to Paul, "\add Please\add* tell us, what is this new message that
you\add (sg)\add* are teaching people? 
\v 20 You are teaching some things that startle us\add (exc)\add*, so we want to know what they mean."
\v 21  \add They said that, because\add* the people of Athens and also the people from other regions who lived there
continually talked about what was new \add to them\add*, or they listened to
\add others tell\add* what was new. 
\s Acts 17:22-31 
\s Paul told them about the God whom they did not know. 
\p
\v 22 Then Paul stood up before the men of the city council and said, "Citizens of Athens, I see that you are very
religious\f + \ft Or: think that it is very important to worship many gods \f*.
\v 23 I \add say that\add* because, while I was walking along and observing the objects
\add that represent different gods that\add* you worship, I even saw an altar that had these words
\add that someone had\add* carved \add on it: THIS HONORS\add* THE GOD
\add THAT WE(exc)\add* DO NOT KNOW. So now I will tell you about
\add that God\add* whom you worship but you do not know. 
\p
\v 24 He is the God who made the world and everything in it. Because he rules over all
\add beings in\add* heaven and \add on\add* earth, he does not dwell in shrines that people have made.
\v 25 He does not need to have anything made for him by people \f + \ft metonymy \f* {to have people \f + \ft metonymy \f* make \f + \ft metonymy \f* anything for him},
because everything that exists belongs to him. He is the one who causes
us\add (inc)\add*\f + \ft Or: all people \f* to live and breathe, and \add he gives
us\add* all the things \add that we(inc) need\add*. 
\p
\v 26  \add In the beginning\add*, God created one couple, and from them God produced all the ethnic groups\f + \ft Or: the nations \f* that
now live everywhere on the earth. He also decided where each ethnic group of people should live and how long they should live
\add there\add*. 
\v 27 He wanted people to realize that they need him. Then maybe they would seek for him and find him.
\add God wants us to seek him\add*, although he is \add really\add* close \f + \ft litotes \f* to each one of us.
\v 28 As someone has said, '\add It is only\add* because he enables us that
we\add (inc)\add* live and move and do \add what we do\add*.' And, as some of your own poets have said,
'We\add (inc)\add* are God's children.' 
\p
\v 29 Therefore, because we are God's children, we\add (inc)\add* should not think that he is anything like an image
\add that people have made\add* of gold or silver or stone. Those images are designed and skillfully made {People design and
make those images}, \add but they are not alive\add*. 
\v 30 During the times when people did not know \add what God wanted them to
do\add*, he did not \add immediately\add* punish \add them for what they
did\add*. But now God commands all people everywhere to turn away from their evil behavior.
\v 31  \add He tells us\add* that on a certain day that he has chosen he is going to judge
\add all of us(inc) people in\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* the world. He has appointed a
\add certain\add* man to judge \add us, and that man will judge each of
us\add* fairly\f + \ft Or: justly \f*. God has shown to all \add people that he has appointed that man to judge
everyone\add*, because God caused him to become alive again after he had died\f + \ft Or: raised him from the dead \f*."
\s Acts 17:32-34 
\s Some Council members believed in Jesus. 
\p
\v 32 When the men of the council heard \add Paul say\add* that \add a
man\add* had become alive again after he had died\f + \ft Or: \add someone\add* had been raised from the dead \f*, some of them laughed
scornfully. But others said, "We\add (exc)\add* would like you\add (sg)\add* to tell us more about this, some other time."
\v 33 After they said that, Paul departed from the council \add meeting\add*.
\v 34 However, some of the people there went along with Paul and became believers. Among those
\add who believed in Jesus\add* was a member of the council whose\add name
was\add* Dionysius. Also, an \add important\add* woman whose name was Damaris and some other people
\add who had heard Paul's message also believed in Jesus\add*.
