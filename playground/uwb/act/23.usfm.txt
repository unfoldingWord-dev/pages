\c 23  
\s Acts 23:1-5 
\s Paul apologized for unknowingly denouncing the high priest. 
\p
\v 1 Paul looked straight at the Jewish council members and said: “My fellow Jews, all my life I have lived respecting our God,
and I do not know of anything that I have done that I knew was wrong/evil.”
\v 2 When Ananias the high priest \add heard what Paul said\add*, he commanded the men who were standing near Paul to hit him
on the mouth. 
\v 3 Then Paul said to Ananias, “God will punish you\add (sg) for
that\add*, you hypocrite \f + \fk metaphor \f*! You sit there and judge me, using the laws that
\add God gave Moses\add*. But you \add yourself\add* disobey those laws, because you commanded me to be struck
{\add these men\add* to strike me} \add without having proved that I have done anything that is
wrong!\add*” 
\v 4 The men who were standing near Paul \add rebuked him. They\add* said, “Are not
you\add (sg)\add* afraid to insult God's \add servant, our\add* high priest?”
\v 5 Paul replied, “My fellow Jews, I \add am sorry that I said that\add*. I did not know that the man
\add who told one of you to hit me\add* is the high priest. \add If I had known that, I would not have insulted our high
priest\add*, because I \add know that\add* it is written {\add that
Moses\add* wrote} \add in our Jewish law\add*, ‘Do not speak evil of any of your rulers!’”
\s Acts 23:6-10 
\s The commander rescued Paul from the Council members. 
\p
\v 6 Paul realized that some of the \add Council members\add* were Sadducees and others were Pharisees. So,
\add in order to cause the Pharisees and Sadducees to argue among themselves instead of accusing
him\add*, he called out loudly in the Council \add hall\add*, “My fellow Jews, I am a Pharisee, like my father was. I have been
put {\add You\add* have put me} on trial \add here\add* because I confidently expect that
\add some day God\add* will ◄cause people who have died to become alive again/raise people from the dead►.”
\v 7 When he said that, the Pharisees and Sadducees started to argue with one another
\add about whether people who have died will become alive again or
not\add*. 
\v 8 The Sadducees believe that after people die, they will not become alive again. They also believe that there are no angels
and no \add other kinds of\add* spirits. But the Pharisees believe
\add that all people who have died will one day become alive again. They also
believe\add* that there are \add angels and other kinds of spirits\add*.
\v 9 So they ◄were divided/did not agree with each other►, and they began shouting at one another
\add as they argued\add*. Some of the teachers of the laws that \add God gave
Moses\add* who were Pharisees stood up. One of them said, “We\add (exc)\add* think that this man has done nothing wrong.”
Another said, “Maybe an angel or some \add other\add* spirit \add really\add* spoke to him
\add and what he says is true\add*.” 
\v 10 Then the \add Pharisees and Sadducees\add* argued even more loudly
\add with one another\add*. As a result, the commander ◄was afraid/thought► that they would tear Paul to pieces. So he
\add commanded\add* soldiers to go down \add from the barracks\add* and forcefully take Paul away from the Council members and
bring him up into the barracks. \add So the soldiers did that\add*.
\s Acts 23:11 
\s The Lord revealed that Paul would tell people about him in Rome.
\p
\v 11 That night, \add in a vision Paul saw\add* the Lord \add Jesus come
and\add* stand near him. The Lord said \add to him\add*, “Be courageous!
You\add (sg)\add* have told people \add here\add* in Jerusalem about me, and you must tell people in Rome
\add about me\add*, too.” 
\s Acts 23:12-15 
\s Some Jews plotted to kill Paul. 
\p
\v 12 The next morning \add some\add* of the Jews \f + \fk metonymy \f* \add who hated
Paul\add* met secretly and talked \add about how they could kill
him\add*. They promised \add themselves\add* that they would not eat or drink anything until they had killed him. They asked
God to curse them \add if they did not do what they promised\add*.
\v 13 There were more than forty men who planned to do that. 
\v 14 They went to the chief priests and \add Jewish\add* elders and told them, “God has heard us promise/vow that
we\add (exc)\add* will not eat \add or drink\add* anything until
we\add (exc)\add* have killed Paul. 
\v 15 So \add we request that\add* you go to the commander and ask him, on behalf of the whole Jewish Council, to bring Paul
down to us \add from the barracks\add*. Tell the commander that you want to question Paul some more. But
we\add (exc)\add* will be waiting to kill Paul while he is on the way here.”
\s Acts 23:16-22 
\s Paul's nephew warned that some Jews had plotted to kill Paul.
\p
\v 16 But the son of Paul's sister heard what they were planning to do, so he went into the barracks and told Paul.
\v 17  \add When Paul heard that\add*, he called one of the officers and said to him,
“\add Please\add* take this young man to the commander, because he needs to tell him something
\add important\add*.” 
\v 18 So the officer took Paul's nephew to the commander. The officer said to the commander, “That prisoner, Paul, called me
and said, ‘Please take this young man to the commander, because he needs to tell him something
\add important\add*.’” 
\v 19 The commander took the young man by the hand, led him off by himself, and asked him, “What do
you\add (sg)\add* need to tell me?” 
\v 20 He said, “\add There are some\add* \f + \fk synecdoche \f* Jews who have planned to ask
you\add (sg)\add* to bring Paul before their Council tomorrow. They will say that they want to ask him some more questions.
\add But that is not true\add*. 
\v 21 Do not do what they ask you\add (sg)\add* to do, because there are more than forty
\add Jewish\add* men who will be hiding and waiting \add to attack Paul when he passes by on the way to the
Council\add*. They even promised/vowed to God that they will not eat or drink anything until they have killed Paul. They are
ready \add to do it\add*, and right now they are waiting for you\add (sg)\add* to agree
\add to do what they are asking you to do\add*.” 
\v 22 The commander said to \add Paul's\add* young nephew, “Do not tell anyone that
you\add (sg)\add* have told me \add about their plan\add*.” Then he sent the young man away.
\s Acts 23:23-35 
\s Many soldiers escorted Paul safely to Governor Felix at Caesarea.
\p
\v 23 Then the commander called two of his officers and told them, “Get a group of two hundred soldiers ready
\add to travel\add*. Take along seventy soldiers riding horses, and two hundred other soldiers carrying spears.
\add All of you must be ready\add* to leave at nine o'clock tonight, to go
\add down\add* to Caesarea \add city\add*. 
\v 24 And take along horses for Paul \add and those accompanying
him\add* to ride, and safely escort him to \add the palace of\add* Governor Felix.”
\v 25 Then the commander wrote a letter \add to send to the governor\add*. This is what he wrote:
\v 26 “\add I am\add* Claudius Lysias \add writing to you\add*. You, Felix, are our governor whom
we\add (exc)\add* respect, \add and I sincerely send you\add* my greetings.
\v 27 I \add have sent you(sg)\add* this man, \add Paul, because
certain\add* Jews seized him and were about to kill him. But I heard
\add someone tell me\add* that he is a Roman citizen, so I and my soldiers went and rescued him.
\v 28 I wanted to know what those Jews were saying that he had done wrong, so I took him to their Jewish Council.
\v 29 I listened \add while they asked this man questions and he answered
them\add*. The things \add they\add* accused him about were entirely concerned with their
\add Jewish\add* laws. But Paul has not disobeyed any of our \add Roman\add* laws.
\add So our officials\add* should not execute him or \add even\add* put him in prison \f + \fk metonymy \f*.
\v 30  \add Someone\add* told me that some \f + \fk synecdoche \f* Jews were secretly planning to kill this man, so I immediately sent him to
you, \add so that you(sg) may give him a fair trial there\add*. I have also
\add commanded\add* the Jews who have accused him to \add go there to Caesarea
and\add* tell you\add (sg) what they are accusing him about\add*.”
\p
\v 31 So the soldiers did what \add the commander commanded\add* them,
\add taking this letter with them\add*. They \add got Paul and\add* took him with them during the night
\add down\add* to Antipatris \add city\add*. 
\v 32 The next day, the foot soldiers returned to the barracks \add in
Jerusalem\add* and the soldiers who rode horses went on with Paul.
\v 33 When the men escorting Paul arrived in Caesarea, they delivered the letter to the governor, and they delivered Paul to
the governor. \add Then the horsemen returned to Jerusalem\add*.
\v 34 The governor read the letter and then he said to Paul, “What province are
you\add (sg)\add* from?” \add Paul answered\add*, “I am from Cilicia
\add province\add*.” 
\v 35 Then the governor said, “When the people who have accused you\add (sg)\add* arrive, I will listen
\add to what each of you says\add* and then I will judge your case.” Then he
\add commanded\add* that Paul be guarded {\add soldiers\add* to guard Paul} in the palace that King Herod
\add the Great had built\add*.
