\c 19  
\s Acts 19:1-7 
\s Paul helped some men to become real believers in Jesus. 
\p
\v 1 While Apollos was at Corinth, Paul \add left the places in Phrygia and
Galatia\add* provinces where he had been visiting, and traveled through
\add Asia province\add* back to Ephesus. He met some people \add who said that
they\add* were believers. 
\v 2 He asked them, "Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed
\add God's message\add*?" They answered, "No, we\add (exc) did not\add*. We have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit."
\v 3 So Paul asked, "So when you were baptized, what \add were you
showing\add*?" They replied, "\add We were showing\add* that we\add (exc)\add* believed what John
\add the Baptizer\add* taught." 
\v 4 Paul said, "John baptized people who turned away from their sinful behavior. He
\add also\add* told the people to believe in the one who would come after he
\add had come\add*, and that was Jesus." 
\v 5 So, when those men heard that, they were baptized \add to affirm that they
believed\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* in the Lord Jesus. 
\v 6 After that, Paul placed his hands on their heads\add one by
one\add*, and the \add power of the\add* Holy Spirit came upon\add each
of\add* them. The \add Holy Spirit\add* enabled them to speak in various languages \f + \ft metonymy \f*
\add that they had not learned\add*, and they also spoke messages
\add that the Holy Spirit\add* revealed to them. 
\v 7 There were about twelve men \add whom Paul baptized and who received the power of the Holy
Spirit\add*. 
\s Acts 19:8-10 
\s Paul helped many people in Asia province to hear the gospel. 
\p
\v 8 For three months after that, Paul entered the Jewish meeting place
\add in Ephesus on each\add* Sabbath\f + \ft Or: Jewish \f* day of rest, and he spoke boldly. He convincingly taught
\add the people\add* about how God wanted to rule \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add their
lives\add*. 
\v 9  \add A few of the people in the meeting house believed the message about
Jesus\add*. But some of the people would not believe that message and did not want to
\add continue to\add* hear it. While many people were listening, they said many bad things about the way
\add for people to receive eternal life about which Paul was preaching\add*. So Paul left them and took the believers with him
\add to meet in another place\add*. He taught every day in a lecture hall
\add that a man whose name was\add* Tyrannus \add lectured in\f + \ft Or: owned \f*\add*.
\v 10 For two years Paul continued to teach people in that building. In this way, most of \f + \ft hyperbole \f* the Jews and non-Jews who lived
in Asia \add province\add* heard the message about the Lord \add Jesus\add*.
\s Acts 19:11-12 
\s God enabled Paul to do amazing miracles. 
\p
\v 11 Also, God gave Paul the power \f + \ft metonymy \f* to do amazing miracles.
\v 12  \add If those who were sick could not come to Paul, handkerchiefs or aprons that Paul had touched would be taken
and\add* placed on the sick people {\add others\add* would take \add and place
on\add* the sick people handkerchiefs or aprons that Paul had touched}. As a result, those sick people would people become
well, and evil spirits that troubled people would leave. 
\s Acts 19:13-17 
\s People honored Jesus' name, after Jewish exorcists misused it and failed.
\p
\v 13 There were also some Jews who traveled around \add to\add* various
places\add , and\add* they commanded the evil spirits in those places to depart
\add from them. Certain ones of those Jews once\add* tried to command the evil spirits to come out of people by saying "I
command you by the authority \f + \ft metonymy \f* of the Lord Jesus, the man about whom Paul preaches, to come out!"
\v 14 There were seven men who were doing that. They were sons of a man named Sceva, a Jew,
\add who called himself\add* a chief priest. 
\v 15 But \add one day as they were doing that\add*, the evil spirit
\add refused to come out of that person. Instead, he\add* said to them, "I know Jesus, and I know
\add that he has authorized\add* Paul \add to expel demons\add*. But no one has authorized
you\add to do anything to me!\add*\f + \ft Or: who authorized you \add to do anything to
me\add*? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*" 
\v 16  \add After saying that, suddenly\add* the man who was controlled by the evil spirit jumped on the seven Jewish men,
\add one after another\add*, knocked all of them down, and beat each of them severely. He tore off their clothes and wounded
them, causing them to bleed. So, \add greatly frightened, they all\add* ran out of the house.
\v 17 All the people who lived in Ephesus, both Jews and non-Jews, heard what had happened. So they were afraid \f + \ft metonymy \f*. They
honored the Lord Jesus \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add because they realized that he was very
powerful\add*. 
\s Acts 19:18-22 
\s Many believers confessed their former sins and burned their books of magic.
\p
\v 18  \add At that time\add*, while other believers were listening, many believers confessed the evil things that they had
been doing. 
\v 19 Several of those who had \add previously\add* practiced sorcery gathered up their scrolls
\add that told how to work\add* magic and burned them in a public place. When people added up how much those scrolls had cost,
they realized that altogether the amount was fifty thousand valuable silver coins.
\p
\v 20 As a result, many more people heard \f + \ft metonymy \f* the message about the Lord
\add Jesus\add*, and the message powerfully \add changed their lives\add*.
\p
\v 21 After those things had happened, Paul decided that he wanted to go to Jerusalem, but he decided that
\add first\add* he would visit \add the believers in\add* Macedonia and Achaia
\add provinces again\add*. Paul said, "After I have been to Jerusalem, I must also go to Rome."
\v 22 He sent two of his helpers, Timothy and Erastus, ahead to Macedonia. But Paul stayed a little longer
\add in Ephesus city\add*, in Asia \add province\add*. 
\s Acts 19:23-24 
\s Demetrius made silver shrines of the goddess Artemis. 
\p
\v 23  \add Soon after that\add*, some of the people there tried to make a lot of \f + \ft litotes \f* trouble for the people who believed the
way \add God revealed for us(inc) to receive eternal life\add*. 
\v 24 There was a man there whose name was Demetrius who made little images out of silver.
\add They were models\add* of the temple of \add a goddess whose name
was\add* Artemis. Demetrius and the other men \add who made those little
images\add* earned a lot of \f + \ft litotes \f* money \add from selling those images\add*.
\s Acts 19:25-31 
\s Demetrius incited people to shout and to riot. 
\p
\v 25 Demetrius called a meeting of his workmen and also of others who made the little silver images. He said to them, "Men,
you know that we\add (inc)\add* earn a lot of money doing our kind of work.
\v 26 Also, you know that \add this fellow\add* Paul has persuaded many people who live in Ephesus
\add to no longer buy the images that we make. Now even the people
from\add* many other towns in our province \add no longer want to buy what we
make\add*. This fellow tells people that the gods that we have made
\add and worship\add* are not gods \add and that we should not worship
them\add*. 
\v 27  \add If people continue to listen to him\add*, soon they will ruin our business. Besides, they will no longer think that
they should \add come to\add* the temple of Artemis \add to worship her.
People\add* all over our Asia \add province\add* and everywhere \f + \ft hyperbole \f* else worship
\add our great\add* goddess \add Artemis. Soon people\add* may no longer consider that Artemis is great!"
\v 28 All the men there were very angry \add at Paul\add* when they heard what Demetrius said. They began to shout, "The
goddess Artemis of us Ephesians is very great!" 
\v 29 Many of the other people in the city heard the shouting and went
\add and joined the crowd. They also became angry at Paul\add* and began shouting.
\add Several of\add* the people seized Gaius and Aristarchus, two men
\add from Macedonia\add* who had been traveling with Paul \add . Then the whole crowd of people ran, dragging those men along
with them\add*, to the city stadium. 
\v 30 Paul also wanted to go \add to the stadium and speak to\add* the people, but the other believers would not let him go
there. 
\v 31 Also, some government officials of that province who were friends of Paul
\add heard what was happening\add*. So they sent someone to tell him
\add urgently\add* not to go into the stadium. 
\s Acts 19:32-34 
\s The crowd shouted, "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!" 
\p
\v 32 The crowd of people \add in the stadium\add* continued shouting. Some shouted one thing, and some shouted something else.
But most of them did not even know what the meeting was about! 
\v 33 One of the \add Jews there was named Alexander. Some of\add* the Jews pushed him to the front of the stadium,
\add so that he could speak to the crowd of people\add*. So Alexander motioned with his hands to the crowd,
\add wanting them to be quiet\add*. He wanted to tell them that \add the
Jews\add* were not responsible \add for the riot\add*. 
\v 34 But \add many of the non-Jewish people\add* knew that Alexander was a Jew.
\add They also knew that the Jews did not worship the goddess Artemis. So the non-Jews
there\add* unitedly \add and\add* repeatedly shouted for about two hours, "Great is
\add the goddess\add* Artemis \add whom we(inc)\add* Ephesians \add worship\add*!"
\s Acts 19:35-41 
\s The city secretary quieted, warned and dismissed the crowd. 
\p
\v 35 Then the city secretary made the crowd stop shouting, and he said to them, "My fellow-citizens, everyone in the world
knows \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* that \add we(inc) people who live in\add* Ephesus \add city\add* guard the temple
\add where we worship\add* the great \add goddess\add* Artemis. Also,
\add everyone knows that we(inc) watch over\add* the \add sacred\add* image
\add of our goddess\add* that fell down from heaven! 
\v 36 Of course everyone knows that, and no one can say that these things are not true. So you should be quiet now. Do not
suddenly do anything foolish\f + \ft Or: that will cause us trouble \f*. 
\v 37 You \add should not\add* have brought these \add two\add* men
\add here, because they have not done anything evil\add*. They have not gone into our temples and taken things
\add from there\add*. And they have not spoken evil of our goddess.
\v 38 Therefore, if Demetrius and his fellow-workmen want to accuse anyone
\add about anything bad, they should do it in the right way\add*. There are courts
\add that you can go to when you want to accuse someone\add*, and there are judges
\add there who have been appointed by the government\add* {\add whom the government has
appointed\add*}. You can accuse \add anyone there\add*. 
\v 39 But if you want to ask about something else, \add you should
ask\add* for \add other officials to\add* resolve it when \add those\add* officials legally assemble.
\v 40  \add And this is certainly not a legal meeting! Resolve this
legally\add* because, if \add we(inc) do\add* not, I am afraid \add that the
governor\add* will hear about all this noise\add that you have made\add* and will say that
we\add (inc)\add* were trying to rebel \add against the government\add*. If he would ask me what you were all shouting about, I
would not be able to give him an answer." 
\v 41 That is what the city secretary said \add to the crowd\add*. Then he told them all to go
\add home. So they left\add*.
