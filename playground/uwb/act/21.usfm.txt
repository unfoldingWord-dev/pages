\c 21  
\s Acts 21:1-3 
\s Paul, Luke and his other companions traveled from Miletus to Tyre.
\p
\v 1  \add After\add* we said goodbye to the elders \add from Ephesus\add*, we
\add got on the ship and\add* traveled on the water to Cos\add Island, where the ship stopped for the
night\add*. The next day we went \add in the ship\add* from Cos to Rhodes
\add Island, where the ship stopped again. The day after\add* that we went to Patara
\add town, where the ship stopped. This was on Patara Island\add*.
\v 2  \add At Patara we left that ship, and someone told us that\add* there was a ship that would be going to Phoenicia
\add region. So\add* we got on that ship, and it left. 
\v 3  \add We traveled over the sea until\add* we could see Cyprus\add Island\add*. We passed to the south of the island and
continued sailing until we arrived at \add Phoenicia region, in\add* Syria
\add province\add*. We arrived at Tyre\add city. The ship was going to stay there several days, because its
workers\add* had to unload the cargo. 
\s Acts 21:4-6 
\s At Tyre, believers warned Paul not to go to Jerusalem, but he went on.
\p
\v 4  \add Someone told us\add* where the believers in Tyre lived, so
we\add (exc) went and\add* stayed with them for seven days. Because
\add God's\add* Spirit revealed to them ◄\add that people would cause Paul to suffer\f + \ft Or: Paul \f* would
suffer\add*► \add in Jerusalem\add*, they told Paul that he should not go there.
\v 5 But when it was time \add for the ship to leave again\add*, we
\add prepared to\add* continue going \add to Jerusalem\add*. When we left
\add Tyre\add*, all the men and their wives and children went with us
\add to the edge of the sea\add*. We all knelt down there on the sand\f + \ft Or: shore \f* and prayed.
\v 6 After we all said goodbye, Paul and we \add his companions\add* got on the ship, and the
\add other\add* believers returned to their own homes. 
\s Acts 21:7-9 
\s Paul and his companions sailed from Tyre to Caesarea. 
\p
\v 7 After we\add (exc)\add* left Tyre, we continued on \add that
ship\add* to Ptolemais \add city\add*. There were believers there, and we greeted them and stayed with them that night.
\v 8 The next day we left \add Ptolemais\add* and sailed to Caesarea
\add city\add*, where we stayed in the home of Philip, who \add spent his
days\add* telling others how to become disciples of Jesus. He was one of the seven
\add men whom the believers in Jerusalem had chosen to care for the
widows\add*. 
\v 9 He had four daughters who were not married. Each of them \add frequently\add* spoke messages that the Holy Spirit had
revealed to them. 
\s Acts 21:10-14 
\s The believers could not persuade Paul from going on to Jerusalem.
\p
\v 10 After \add we(exc) had been in Philip's house for\add* several days, a believer whose name was Agabus came down from
Judea \add district\add* and arrived \add in Caesarea\add*. He \add frequently\add* spoke messages that the Holy Spirit had
told him. 
\v 11 Coming over to where we were, he took off Paul's belt. Then he tied his own feet and hands with it and said, “The Holy
Spirit says, ‘The Jewish \add leaders\add* \\f + \\ft synecdoche \\f* in Jerusalem will tie up
\add the hands and feet of\add* the owner of this belt, like this, and they will put him in the hands of non-Jewish people
\add as a prisoner\add*.’” 
\v 12 When \add the rest of\add* us heard that, we and \add other\add* believers there repeatedly pled with Paul, “Please do
not go up to Jerusalem!” 
\v 13 But Paul replied, “◄Please stop crying and trying to discourage me \\f + \\ft idiom \\f*
\add from going!\add*\f + \ft Or: Why \f* are you crying and trying to discourage me \\f + \\ft idiom \\f*
\add from going\add*?► \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* I am willing to be put {\add for people\add* to put me} in prison and also to be killed
{\add for them\add* to kill me} in Jerusalem because I \add serve\add* \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* the Lord Jesus.”
\v 14 When \add we(exc) realized that\add* he was determined \add to go to
Jerusalem\add*, we did not try \add any longer\add* to persuade him
\add not to go\add*. We said, “May ◄the Lord \add God\add* do what he wants\f + \ft Or: the \f* Lord's will be done►!”
\s Acts 21:15-16 
\s Paul and other believers went from Caesarea to Jerusalem. 
\p
\v 15 After those days \add in Caesarea\add*, we\add (exc)\add* prepared
\add our things\add* and \add left to\add* go \add by land\add* up to Jerusalem.
\v 16 Some of the believers from Caesarea also went with us. They took us to stay in the house of
\add a man whose name was\add* Mnason. He was from Cyprus \add Island\add*, and he had believed
\add in Jesus\add* when people were first beginning to hear the message
\add about him\add*. 
\s Acts 21:17-26 
\s Paul agreed with church leaders to perform a Jewish purifying ritual.
\p
\v 17 When we arrived in Jerusalem, \add a group of\add* the believers greeted us happily.
\v 18 The next day Paul and the rest of us went to speak with James,
\add who was the leader of the congregation there\add*. All of the
\add other\add* leaders\f + \ft Or: elders \f* \add of the congregation in Jerusalem\add* were also there.
\v 19 Paul greeted them, and then he reported all of the things that God had enabled him to do among the non-Jewish people.
\v 20 When they heard that, James and the other elders said, “Praise the Lord!” Then
\add one of\add* them said to Paul, “Brother\f + \ft Or: Friend \f*, you\add (sg)\add* know that there are very many thousands of
us\add (inc)\add* Jewish people \add here\add* who have believed
\add in the Lord Jesus\add*. Also, you know that we\add (inc)\add* all continue very carefully to obey the laws
\add that Moses gave us\add*. 
\v 21  \add But our fellow Jewish believers\add* have been told {have heard
\add people say\add*} that when you are among non-Jews, you tell the Jewish believers who live there that they should stop
obeying \add the laws\add* \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* ◄\add of\add* Moses\f + \ft Or:  \f*\add that\add*
Moses\add received from God\add*►. \add People say that\add* you tell
\add those Jewish believers\add* not to circumcise their sons and not to practice our
\add other\add* customs. \add We(exc) do not believe that this is
true\add*. 
\v 22 But our fellow \add Jewish\add* believers will certainly hear that you have arrived,
\add and they will be angry with you\add*. So \add you\add* need to do something \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f*
\add to show them that what they heard about you is not true\add*.
\v 23 So you should do what we suggest to you. There are four men among us who have strongly promised
\add to God\add* about \add something\add*. 
\v 24 Go with these men \add to the Temple\add* and \add ritually\add* purify yourself along with them. Then,
\add when it is time for them to offer the sacrifices for that ritual\add*, pay for what they offer
\add as sacrifices\add*. After that, they can shave their heads \add to show that they have done what they promised to do. And
when people see you in the courts of the Temple with those men\add*, they will know that what they have been told {what people
have told them} about you is not true. Instead, all of them will know that you obey all our Jewish laws
\add and rituals\add*. 
\v 25 As for the non-Jewish believers, \add we elders here in Jerusalem have
talked\add* about \add which of our laws\add* they \add should obey,
and\add* we\add (exc)\add* wrote them \add a letter, telling them\add* what we decided.
\add We wrote\add* that they should not eat meat that people have offered as a sacrifice to any idol,
\add that they should not eat\add* blood \add from animals\add* and that
\add they should not eat\add* meat from animals \add that people have killed
by\add* strangling\add them. We also told them that\add* they should not have sex with someone to whom they are not married.”
\v 26 So Paul \add agreed to do what they asked\add*, and the next day he took the
\add four\add* men, and together they ritually purified themselves. After that, Paul went to the Temple
\add courts and\add* told \add the priest\add* what day they would
\add finish\add* purifying themselves \add ritually\add* and when
\add they\add* would offer \add the animals as sacrifices\add* for each of them.
\s Acts 21:27-30 
\s Some Jews seized Paul in the Temple courts. 
\p
\v 27-29 When the seven days \add for purifying themselves\add* were nearly finished, Paul
\add returned\add* to the Temple \add courtyard\add*. Some Jews from Asia
\add province\add* saw him there, \add and they were very angry at
him\add*. On another day they had seen Paul \add walking around\add* in Jerusalem with Trophimus, who was a non-Jew. Their laws
did not permit non-Jews to be in the Temple, and they thought that Paul had brought Trophimus into the Temple
\add courtyard that day. So\add* they called out to many other Jews
\add who were in the Temple courtyard\add* to \add help them\add* seize \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* Paul. They shouted, “Fellow Israelites, come and
help \add us to punish this\add* man! This is the one who is \add constantly\add* teaching people wherever
\add he goes that they\add* should despise the \add Jewish\add* people.
\add He teaches people that they should no longer obey\add* the laws
\add of Moses\add* nor respect this holy \add Temple\add*. He has even brought non-Jews here into
\add the court of\add* our Temple, causing God to consider it no longer holy!”
\v 30  \add People\add* throughout \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* the city heard that there was trouble
\add at the Temple courtyard\add*, and they came running there. They grabbed Paul and dragged him outside of the Temple
\add area\add*. The gates \add to the Temple courtyard were shut\add*
{\add The Temple guards\add* shut the doors \add to the Temple courts\add*} immediately,
\add so that the people would not riot inside the Temple area\add*.
\s Acts 21:31-32 
\s Roman soldiers ran to where those Jews were trying to kill Paul.
\p
\v 31 While they were trying to kill Paul, someone \add ran to the fort near the
Temple\add* and told the Roman commander that many \\f + \\ft hyperbole \\f* people \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* in Jerusalem were rioting
\add at the Temple\add*. 
\v 32 The commander quickly took some officers and \add a large group
of\add* soldiers and ran to \add the Temple area where\add* the crowd was. When the crowd of people
\add who were yelling and beating Paul\add* saw the commander and the soldiers
\add coming\add*, they stopped beating him. 
\s Acts 21:33-40 
\s After the commander arrested Paul, soldiers carried him towards the fort.
\p
\v 33 The commander came to \add where Paul was and\add* seized him. He
\add commanded soldiers\add* to fasten a chain to \add each of\add* Paul's
\add arms\add*. Then he asked \add the people in the crowd\add*, “Who is this man, and what has he done?”
\v 34 Some of the many people there were shouting one thing, \add and\add* some were shouting something else. Because they
continued shouting so loudly, the commander could not understand
\add what they were shouting. So\add* he \add commanded\add* that Paul be taken
{\add the soldiers\add* to take Paul} into the barracks \add so that he could question him
there\add*. 
\v 35  \add The soldiers\add* led Paul to the steps \add of the barracks\add*, but many people continued to follow them, trying
to kill \add Paul. So the commander told\add* the soldiers to carry Paul
\add up the steps into the barracks\add*. 
\v 36 The crowd that followed kept shouting, “Kill him! Kill him!”
\p
\v 37 As Paul was about to be taken {\add the soldiers\add* were about to take Paul} into the barracks, he said
\add in Greek\add* to the commander, “May I speak to you?” The commander said, “◄I am surprised that you can speak the Greek
\add language\add*!\f + \ft Or: Can \f* you\add (sg)\add* speak the Greek \add language\add*?►” \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f*
\v 38 “◄I \add thought\add* that you\add (sg)\add* were that fellow\f + \ft Or: Are \f* you not that fellow► from Egypt \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* who wanted to
rebel \add against the government not long ago\add*, and who took four thousand violent terrorists
\add with him\add* out into the desert, \add so that we could not catch
him\add*?” 
\v 39 Paul answered, “\add No, I am not!\add* I am a Jew. I \add was
born\add* in Tarsus, which is an important \\f + \\ft litotes \\f* city in Cilicia
\add province\add*. I request that you\add (sg)\add* let me speak to the people.”
\v 40 Then the commander permitted Paul \add to speak. So\add* Paul stood on the steps and motioned with his hand
\add for the crowd to be quiet. And after\add* the people in the crowd became quiet, Paul spoke to them in
\add their own\add* Hebrew language \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f*.
