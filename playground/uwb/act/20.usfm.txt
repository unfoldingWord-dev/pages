\c 20  
\s Acts 20:1-6 
\s After being in Macedonia and Greece, Paul went to Troas. 
\p
\v 1 After the people at Ephesus had stopped rioting, Paul summoned the believers. He encouraged them
\add to continue to trust in the Lord Jesus. Soon\add* after that, he told them “Goodbye” and left to go to Macedonia
\add province\add*. 
\v 2  \add After he arrived\add* there, he visited \add each town where there were
believers\add* and encouraged them. Then he arrived in Greece \add province\add*,
\add which is also called Achaia\add*. 
\v 3 He stayed there for three months. Then he planned to return to Syria by ship, but
\add he heard that\add* some of the Jews \f + \fk synecdoche \f* \add in that area\add* were planning to kill him
\add as he traveled. So\add* he decided instead to go \add by land, and he
traveled\add* again through Macedonia. 
\v 4 The men who were going to travel with him \add to Jerusalem
were\add* Sopater, \add who was\add* a son of Pyrrhus, who grew up in Berea
\add town;\add* Aristarchus and Secundus, who were from Thessalonica
\add city;\add* Gaius, \add who was\add* from Derbe \add town;\add* Timothy,
\add who was from Galatia province;\add* and Tychicus and Trophimus who were from Asia
\add province\add*. 
\v 5 Those \add seven\add* men went ahead of \add Paul and me, Luke, by ship from Macedonia,
so\add* they got to Troas \add before we did and\add* waited for
\add the two of\add* us there. 
\v 6  \add But we two(exc) traveled by land as far as\add* Philippi
\add city\add*. After the Jewish festival \add when they eat\add* unleavened bread, we got on a ship
\add that was going from\add* the port near \add Philippi to Troas
city\add*. After five days we\add (exc)\add* arrived at Troas and we met the other men who had traveled there
\add ahead of us\add*. Then we \add all\add* stayed in Troas for seven days.
\s Acts 20:7-12 
\s At Troas, Paul encouraged believers by resurrecting Eutychus.
\p
\v 7 ◄On Sunday evening/On the evening of the first day of the week►,
we\add (exc) and the other believers there\add* gathered together to celebrate the Lord's Supper
\add and to eat other food\add* \f + \fk synecdoche \f*. Paul spoke to the believers. He continued teaching them until midnight, because he was
planning to leave \add Troas\add* the next day. 
\v 8 Many \add oil\add* lamps were burning in the upstairs room in which
we\add (exc)\add* had gathered, \add so the fumes caused some people to become
sleepy\add*. 
\v 9 A young man whose name was Eutychus was there. He was seated on
\add the sill of\add* an \add open\add* window\add on the third story of the
house\add*. As Paul continued talking for a long time, Eutychus became sleepier and sleepier. Finally, he was sound/really
asleep. He fell \add out of the window\add* from the third story down
\add to the ground. Some of the believers went down\add* immediately and picked him up.
\add But he was\add* dead. 
\v 10 Paul \add also\add* went down. He lay down and stretched out on top of the young man and put his arms around him. Then he
said \add to the people who were standing around\add*, “Do not worry, he is alive
\add again now!\add*” 
\v 11 Then Paul, \add along with the others\add*, went upstairs again and they ate the Lord's Supper and other food \f + \fk synecdoche \f*.
Afterwards, Paul conversed with the believers until dawn. Then he left.
\v 12 The \add other\add* people took the young man \add home\add*, and were greatly encouraged because he was alive
\add again\add*. 
\s Acts 20:13-16 
\s Paul and his companions traveled from Troas to Miletus. 
\p
\v 13 We then went to the ship. Paul did not get on the ship \add with us in
Troas\add*, because he preferred to go \add more quickly\add* overland to Assos
\add town\add*. The rest of us got on the ship and sailed for Assos.
\v 14 We\add (exc)\add* met Paul in Assos. He got on \add the ship\add* with us, and we sailed to Mitylene
\add town\add*. 
\v 15 The day after \add we reached Mitylene\add*, we \add sailed from there
and\add* arrived \add at a place\add* near Kios\add Island\add*. The day after that, we sailed to
Samos\add Island\add*. The next day we \add left Samos and\add* sailed to Miletus
\add town\add*. 
\v 16  \add Miletus was just south of Ephesus city\add*. Paul had
\add earlier\add* decided that he would not get on a ship that would stop at Ephesus, because he did not want to spend
\add several\add* days in Asia \add province\add*. If possible, he wanted to arrive in Jerusalem by the
\add time of the\add* Pentecost festival, \add and the time of that festival was
near\add*. 
\s Acts 20:17-21 
\s Paul reminded the Ephesian elders how he had conducted himself and had taught them.
\p
\v 17  \add When the ship arrived at\add* Miletus, Paul sent \add a
messenger\add* to Ephesus to ask the elders of the congregation to come to talk with him.
\p
\v 18 When the elders arrived, Paul said to them, “You personally know how I
\add conducted myself among you the entire time\add* that I was with you, from the first day when I arrived
\add here\add* in Asia \add province until the day I left\add*. 
\v 19  \add You know how\add* I was serving the Lord \add Jesus\add* very humbly and how I sometimes wept
\add about people. You also know how\add* I suffered because the Jews \f + \fk synecdoche \f*
\add who were not believers often\add* tried \add to harm me\add*.
\v 20 You also know that, as I preached \add God's message\add* to you, I never left out anything that would help you. You know
that I taught you \add God's message\add* when many people were present, and I
\add also went to your\add* homes and taught it there. 
\v 21 I preached both to Jews and to non-Jews, telling them \add all\add* that they must turn away from their sinful
behavior\add . I also told them they should\add* believe in our Lord Jesus.”
\s Acts 20:22-31 
\s Paul told them that they would never see him again. 
\p
\v 22 “And now note this: I am going to Jerusalem, because \add God's\add* Spirit has clearly shown me that I must go there. I
do not know what will happen to me \add while I am there\add*. 
\v 23 But I do know that in each city \add where I have stopped\add*, the Holy Spirit has ◄told
me/\add caused the believers to\add* tell me► that \add in Jerusalem\add* people will put me in prison \f + \fk personification \f* and will cause me
to suffer \f + \fk personification \f*. 
\v 24 But I do not care even if people kill me, if first I am able to finish the work \f + \fk metaphor \f* that the Lord Jesus has told me
\add to do. He appointed me\add* to tell people the good message that God
\add saves us\add* by doing for us what we do not deserve. 
\v 25 I have preached to you the message about how God desires to rule
\add people's lives\add*. But now I know that today is the last time that you fellow believers will see me \f + \fk synecdoche \f*.
\v 26 So I want you all to understand that if anyone \add who has heard me
preach\add* dies \add without trusting in Jesus\add*, it is not my fault \f + \fk metonymy \f*,
\v 27 because I told you \f + \fk litotes \f* everything \f + \fk hyperbole \f* that God has planned for
us\add (inc)\add*. 
\v 28  \add You leaders\add* must continue to believe and obey \add God's message. You must also
help\add* all the other believers \f + \fk metaphor \f* for whom the Holy Spirit has caused you to be responsible \f + \fk metonymy \f*. Watch over \f + \fk metaphor \f*
yourselves and the other believers \add as\add* a shepherd\add watches over his
sheep\add*. God bought them with the blood \add that flowed from\add* his
\add Son's body on the cross\add*. 
\v 29 I know \add very well\add* that after I leave, \add people who
teach\add* \f + \fk metaphor \f* \add false doctrines\add* will come among you and will do great harm to the believers.
\add They will be like\add* fierce wolves \add that kill the sheep\add*.
\v 30 Even in your own group of believers there will be some who will deceive
\add other\add* believers by teaching them messages that are false. They will teach those messages so that some people
\add will believe them and\add* will become their followers. 
\v 31 So watch out \add that none of you stops believing the true message about our Lord
Jesus\add*! Remember that day and night for \add about\add* three years I repeatedly taught you that message, and warned you
with tears\add in my eyes not to believe any other message\add*.”
\s Acts 20:32-35 
\s Paul entrusted them to God and to the message about God's goodness.
\p
\v 32 “\add Now as I leave you\add* I ask God to protect you and to keep you believing the message
\add that he saves us(inc)\add* by doing for us what we do not deserve.
\add If you continue believing\add* the message \add that I told
you\add*, you will become \add spiritually mature\add*, and God will give you the blessings that he has promised to give to all
of those who belong to him. 
\p
\v 33  \add As for myself\add*, I have not desired anyone's money \f + \fk metonymy \f* or
\add fine\add* clothing. 
\v 34 You yourselves know that I have worked \add with my hands\add* \f + \fk metonymy \f* to earn the money that my companions and I needed.
\v 35 In everything that I did, I showed you that we\add (inc)\add* should work hard in order
\add to have enough money\add* to give some to those who are needy.
We\add (inc)\add* should remember that our Lord Jesus himself said, ‘You are happy when people give you what you need, but God
will be happy with you when you give other people what they need.’ ”
\s Acts 20:36-38 
\s Paul prayed with them and they sadly bade him farewell. 
\p
\v 36 When Paul had finished speaking, he knelt down with all of the elders and prayed.
\v 37 They all cried a lot, and they hugged Paul and kissed him.
\v 38 They were especially sad because he had said that they would never see him \f + \fk synecdoche \f* again. Then they
\add all\add* went with him to the ship.
