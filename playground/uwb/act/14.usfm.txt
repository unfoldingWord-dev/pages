\s Acts 14:1-3 
\s Paul and Barnabas preached the gospel and performed miracles in Iconium.
\p
\v 1 At Iconium Paul and Barnabas went as usual into the Jewish meeting place and spoke very convincingly
\add about the Lord Jesus\add*. As a result, many Jews and also non-Jews believed
\add in Jesus\add*. 
\v 2 But \add some of\add* the Jews refused to believe \add that message,
and\add* told the non-Jews not to believe it. They told the non-Jewish people that the message
\add about Jesus\add* was not true. As a result, \add some of\add* the non-Jews became angry towards the believers
\add there\add*. 
\v 3 So Paul and Barnabas spent considerable time there speaking boldly for the Lord, and the Lord Jesus enabled them to do
many miracles. In this way he showed \add people\add* that the message about how the Lord saves us in a way that we do not
deserve is true. 
\s Acts 14:4-7 
\s Before people could attack the apostles, they escaped to Lystra and Derbe.
\p
\v 4 The people \add who lived\add* in \add Iconium\add* city strongly disagreed with each other
\add concerning the message about Jesus\add*. Some of them agreed with the Jews \f + \fr synecdoche \f*
\add who did not believe that message\add*. Others agreed with the
\add two\add* apostles. 
\v 5 Then the non-Jewish people and the Jewish \add leaders\add* \f + \fr synecdoche \f*
\add who opposed Paul and Barnabas\add* talked among themselves about how they could mistreat Paul and Barnabas. Some of the
important men in that city agreed to help them. Together, they decided that they would
\add kill Paul and Barnabas by\add* throwing stones at them. 
\v 6 But Paul and Barnabas heard about that, so they quickly went away to Lycaonia
\add district. They went\add* to Lystra and Derbe \add towns in that
district\add* and to the area surrounding \add those towns\add*.
\v 7  \add While they were\add* in that area, they continually told the people the message
\add about the Lord Jesus\add*. 
\s Acts 14:8-10 
\s God enabled Paul to heal a lame man. 
\p
\v 8  \add Once while Paul was preaching to people\add* in Lystra, a man was sitting there who was crippled in his legs. When
\add his mother\add* bore him he had crippled legs, so he was never able to walk.
\v 9 He listened as Paul was speaking \add about the Lord Jesus\add*. Paul looked directly at him and could see
\add in the man's face\add* that he believed that \add the Lord Jesus\add* could make him well.
\v 10 So Paul called out \add to him\add*, “Stand up!” \add When the man heard
that\add*, he \add immediately\add* jumped up and began to walk \add normally\add*.
\s Acts 14:11-18 
\s The apostles stopped the people from worshipping them. 
\p
\v 11 When the crowd saw what Paul had done, \add they thought that Paul and
Barnabas\add* ◄\add were/must be\add*► \add the gods that they worshipped\add*. So they shouted
\add excitedly\add* in their \add own\add* Lycaonia language, “\add Look! These people
are\add* the gods \add that we(inc) worship! They\add* have made themselves look like people and have come down
\add from the sky/heaven to help us\add*!” 
\v 12 They began to say that Barnabas was \add probably the chief god, whose name
was\add* Zeus. And \add they began to say that\add* Paul was Hermes,
\add the messenger/spokesman for the other gods. They mistakenly thought
that\add* because Paul was the one who had been speaking. 
\v 13 Just outside \add the gates of\add* the city there was a temple
\add where the people worshipped Zeus. The priest who was there heard what Paul and Barnabas had done, so he
came\add* to the city gate, where many people had already gathered. He brought
\add two\add* bulls with wreaths \add of flowers around their necks\add*. The priest and the other people wanted to kill the
bulls \add as part of a ceremony\add* to worship Paul and Barnabas.
\v 14 But when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard about that,
\add and understood that the people thought that they were gods and wanted to sacrifice the bulls to worship
them\add*, they \add were very distressed\add*, so they tore their own clothes. They rushed among the people, shouting,
\v 15 “Men, ◄you must not kill those bulls \add to worship us(dl)!\add*/why are you doing this?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*
\add We are not gods!\add* We are just human beings like you! We have come to tell you some good news!
\add We have come to tell you about\add* the God who is all-powerful. He wants you to stop worshipping other gods, because they
cannot help you. This true God made the heaven/sky and the earth and the oceans and everything in it.
\v 16 In the past, all of you non-Jewish people \add worshipped whatever gods that you wanted
to\add*. God let you worship them, \add because you did not know
him\add*. 
\v 17 But he has shown us \f + \fr litotes \f* \add that\add* he acts kindly\add toward
us(inc)\add*. He is the one who causes it to rain and causes crops to grow. He is the one who gives you plenty of food, and
makes you very happy.” 
\v 18 The people heard what \add Paul\add* said, but they still thought that they should sacrifice those bulls to worship Paul
and Barnabas. \add But finally, the people decided not to do it\add*.
\s Acts 14:19-20a 
\s Some Jews incited people to stone Paul at Lystra. 
\p
\v 19  \add However\add*, after that, some Jews came from Antioch and Iconium and persuaded many of the people of Lystra
\add that the message Paul had been telling them\add* was not true. The people
\add who believed what those Jews said became angry with Paul. They let the
Jews\add* throw stones at him \add until he fell down, unconscious\add*. They
\add all\add* thought that he was dead, so they dragged him outside the city
\add and left him lying there\add*. But some of the believers \add in Lystra had followed them outside the
city\add*. 
\v 20 They came and stood around Paul, \add where he was lying on the
ground\add*. And Paul \add became conscious! He\add* stood up and went back into the city
\add with the believers\add*. 
\s Acts 14:20b-23 
\s The apostles revisited believers and appointed leaders. 
\p The next day, Paul and Barnabas \add left Lystra town and\add* traveled to Derbe
\add town\add*. 
\v 21 They \add stayed there several days and they kept telling\add* the people the good message
\add about Jesus\add*. Many people became believers. After that, Paul and Barnabas
\add started on their way back. They\add* went again to Lystra. \add Then they went from
there\add* to Iconium, and \add then they went\add* to Antioch \add in Pisidia
province\add*. 
\v 22  \add In each town\add*, they helped the believers \f + \fr synecdoche \f* to become strong
\add spiritually\add*, and they urged them to keep on trusting in
\add the Lord Jesus\add*. They told \add the believers\add*, “It is necessary that
\add we endure\add* people often persecuting us\add (inc)\add* before we enter the place where God will rule
\add over us forever\add*.” 
\v 23 Paul and Barnabas appointed leaders for each congregation.
\add And before Paul and Barnabas left each town, they gathered the believers together and spent some
time\add* praying and ◄fasting/not eating any food►. Then Paul and Barnabas entrusted the
\add leaders and other believers\add* to the Lord \add Jesus\add*, in whom they had believed,
\add in order that he would care for them\add*. 
\s Acts 14:24-28 
\s Paul and Barnabas reported to the believers at Syrian Antioch.
\p
\v 24 After Paul and Barnabas had traveled through Pisidia \add district\add*, they went
\add south\add* to Pamphylia \add district\add*. 
\v 25  \add In that district\add*, they \add arrived\add* at Perga
\add town and\add* preached God's message \add about the Lord Jesus to the people there.
Then\add* they went down \add to the seacoast\add* at Attalia \add town\add*.
\v 26 There they got on a ship and went back to Antioch \add city in Syria
province\add*. That was the place where Paul and Barnabas had been appointed {where
\add believers\add* had sent Paul and Barnabas} to go \add to other
places\add* and preach. \add Antioch was the place where the believers\add* had asked God to kindly help Paul and Barnabas in
the work that they had now completed. 
\v 27 When they arrived in Antioch, they called the believers together. Then Paul and Barnabas told them all that God had
helped them to do. \add Specifically, they told them how God\add* had enabled \f + \fr idiom \f*
\add many\add* non-Jewish people to believe \add in Jesus\add*. 
\v 28 Then Paul and Barnabas stayed in Antioch with the \add other\add* believers for several months.
