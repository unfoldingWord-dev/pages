\s Acts 10:1-8 
\s Obeying an angel, Cornelius sent men to summon Peter. 
\p
\v 1  \add There was\add* a man \add who lived\add* in Caesarea \add city\add* whose name was Cornelius. He was an officer who
commanded 100 men in a large group of \add Roman\add* soldiers from Italy.
\v 2 He always tried to do what would please God; he and his entire household \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f*
\add were non-Jews who\add* habitually worshipped God. He sometimes gave money to help poor
\add Jewish\add* people, and he prayed to God regularly. 
\p
\v 3  \add One day\add* at about three o'clock in the afternoon \add Cornelius
saw\add* a vision. He clearly saw an angel whom God \add had sent\add*. The angel came into
\add his room\add* and said to him, “Cornelius!” 
\v 4 Cornelius stared at the angel and became terrified. Then he asked
\add fearfully\add*, “Sir, what do you\add (sg)\add* want?” The angel answered him,
“You\add (sg)\add* have pleased God because you have been praying
\add regularly to him\add* and you often give money to \add help\add* poor
people\add . Those things have been\add* like a sacrifice \add to
God\add*. 
\v 5 So now command some men to go to Joppa \add city\add* and \add tell them
to\add* bring back a man named Simon whose other name is Peter. 
\v 6 He is staying with a man, \add also\add* named Simon, who makes leather. His house is near the ocean.”
\v 7 When the angel who spoke to Cornelius had gone, he summoned two of his household servants and a soldier who served him,
one who also worshipped God. 
\v 8 He explained to them everything \add that the angel had said.
Then\add* he told them to go to Joppa \add to ask Peter to come to
Caesarea\add*. 
\s Acts 10:9-16 
\s Peter's vision. 
\p
\v 9 About noon the next day those \add three men\add* were traveling
\add along the road\add* and were coming near \add Joppa. As they were approaching
Joppa\add*, Peter went up on the \add flat\add* housetop to pray.
\v 10 He became hungry and wanted something to eat. While someone was preparing the food,
\add Peter\add* saw \add this\add* vision: 
\v 11 ◄He saw heaven open\f + \ft Or: He \f* saw an opening in the sky► and something like a large sheet was being lowered
\add to the ground\add*. \add It was tied at\add* its four corners
\add with ropes\add*. 
\v 12 Inside the sheet were all kinds of creatures. \add These included animals and birds that the Mosaic laws forbade Jews to
eat\add*. Some had four feet, others crawled on the ground, and others were wild birds.
\v 13 Then \add he heard\add* God \\f + \\ft synecdoche \\f* say to him, “Peter, stand up, kill
\add and cook some of these\add* and eat \add their meat\add*!” 
\v 14 But Peter replied, “Lord, surely you\add (sg)\add* do not \add really want me to do
that\add* I have never eaten any \add meat\add* that \add our Jewish law
says\add* is unacceptable to God or \add something that we(exc)\add* must not eat!”
\v 15  \add Then Peter heard\add* \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* God talk to him a second time. He said,
“\add I am\add* God, \add so\add* if I have made something acceptable
\add to eat\add*, do not say that it is not acceptable \add to eat\add*!”
\v 16  \add This happened\add* three \add times, so he knew that he had to think carefully about what it might
mean\add*. Immediately \add after God had said that the third time\add*,
◄\add the\add* sheet \add with the animals and birds\add* was the pulled back into
heaven\f + \ft Or:  \f*\add someone\add* pulled the sheet \add with the animals and
birds\add* up into the sky again►. 
\s Acts 10:17-23a 
\s The Holy Spirit commanded Peter to go with the non-Jewish men.
\p
\v 17 While Peter was trying to understand what that vision meant, the men who had been sent by Cornelius {whom Cornelius had
sent} \add arrived. They asked people how to get to\add* Simon's house.
\add So they found his house\add* and were standing outside the gate.
\v 18 They called and were asking if a man named Simon, whose other name was Peter, was staying there.
\v 19 While Peter was still trying to understand \add what\add* the vision
\add meant\add*, \add God's\add* Spirit said to him, “Listen! Three men
\add are here who\add* want to see you. 
\v 20 So get up and go downstairs and go with them! Do not think that
you\add (sg)\add* should not go with them \add because of their being
non-Jews\add*, because I have sent them \add here\add*!” 
\v 21 So Peter went down to the men and said to them, “\add Greetings!\add* I am
\add the man\add* you are looking for. Why have you come?” 
\v 22 One of them replied, “Cornelius, who is a \add Roman\add* army officer,
\add sent us here\add*. He is a righteous man who worships God, and all of the Jewish people \\f + \\ft hyperbole \\f*
\add who know about him\add* say that he is a very good man. An angel ◄who was sent from God\f + \ft Or: whom \f* God sent► said to him, ‘Tell
some men to \add go to Joppa to see Simon Peter and\add* bring him here, so that
you\add (sg)\add* can hear what he has to say.’” 
\v 23 So Peter \add said that he would go with them, and then he\add* invited them into
\add the house\add* and told them that they could stay \add there that
night\add*. 
\s Acts 10:23b-26 
\s Peter went with the men and met Cornelius. 
\p The next day Peter got ready and went with the men. Several of the believers from Joppa went with him.
\v 24 The day after that, they arrived in Caesarea \add city\add*. Cornelius was waiting for them. He had also invited his
relatives and close friends \add to come, so they were there in his house
too\add*. 
\v 25 When Peter entered the house, Cornelius met him and bowed low in front of him to worship him.
\v 26 But Peter \add grasped Cornelius by the hand and\add* lifted him to his feet. He said, “Stand up!
\add Do not reverence\f + \ft Or: worship \f* me\add*! I myself am only human, \add like
you\add*!” 
\s Acts 10:27-29 
\s Peter asked why they had sent for him. 
\p
\v 27 While he was talking to Cornelius, Peter \add and the others\add* entered
\add a large room inside the house\add*. Peter saw that many people had gathered together
\add there\add*. 
\v 28 Then Peter said to them, “You all know that any \add of us\add* Jews think we are disobeying
\add our Jewish\add* laws if we\add (exc)\add* associate with a non-Jewish person or
\add if we even\add* visit him. However, God has shown me \add in a
vision\add* that I should not say about anyone that God will not accept him.
\v 29 So when you sent \add some men\add* to ask me to come \add here\add*, I came
\add right away. I\add* did not say that I could not go \add with non-Jewish people. So, please tell
me\add*, why have you asked me to come \add here\add*?” 
\s Acts 10:30-33 
\s Cornelius told about his vision. 
\p
\v 30 Cornelius replied, “About this time four days ago I was praying
\add to God\add* in my house, \add as I regularly do\add* at three o'clock in the afternoon. Suddenly a man whose clothes
\add shone\add* brightly stood in front of me, 
\v 31 and said, ‘Cornelius, when you\add (sg)\add* have prayed, you have been heard by God {God has heard
\add when\add* you\add (sg)\add* have prayed \add to him\add*}. He has also noticed that you have
\add often\add* given money to \add help\add* poor people, \add and he is pleased with
that\add*. 
\v 32 So now, send \add messengers to go\add* to Joppa city\add , in
order\add* to ask Simon whose other name is Peter to come \add here\add*. He is staying near the ocean in a house that belongs
to \add another\add* man named Simon, who makes leather. \add When Simon Peter comes, he will tell you a message from
God\add*.’ 
\v 33 So I immediately sent \add some men who asked\add* you\add (sg) to come
here\add*, and I \add certainly\add* thank you for coming. Now we\add (exc)\add* all are gathered
\add here, knowing that\add* God is with us, in order to hear all the things that the Lord
\add God\add* has commanded you \add to say. So please speak to us\add*.”
\s Acts 10:34-38 
\s Peter reminded them of what they knew about Jesus. 
\p
\v 34 So Peter began to speak \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* to them. He said, “\add Now\add* I understand that it is true that God does not favor only
certain groups \add of people\add*. 
\v 35 Instead, from every group of people he accepts \add everyone
who\add* honors him and who does what pleases him. 
\v 36  \add You know\add* the message that God sent to \add us\add* Israelites.
\add He\add* proclaimed \add to us the good news that he\add* would cause
\add people\add* to have peace \add with him\add* because of what Jesus Christ
\add has done\add*. This \add Jesus is not Lord only over us Israelites.
He\add* is \add also the\add* Lord \add who rules\add* over all \add people\add*.
\v 37 You know what \add he\add* did throughout the land of Judea, beginning in Galilee. He began
\add to do those things\add* after John had been proclaiming\add to people that they should turn away from their sinful
behavior before\add* he baptized them. 
\v 38 You know that God gave \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* his Holy Spirit to Jesus, \add the
man\add* from Nazareth \add town\add*, and gave him the power \add to do miracles. You also
know\add* how Jesus went to many places, always doing good deeds and healing
\add people. Specifically\add*, he was continually healing all the people whom the devil was causing to suffer.
\add Jesus was able to do those things\add* because God was always helping him.”
\s Acts 10:39-43 
\s Peter said that God would forgive the sins of all who believe in Jesus.
\p
\v 39 “We \add apostles\add* tell people about all the things that
\add we saw Jesus\add* do in Jerusalem and in the \add rest of\add* Israel.
\add The leaders in Jerusalem\add* had him killed by being nailed to a cross.
\v 40 However, God caused him to become alive again on the third day
\add after he had died\add*. God \add also\add* enabled \add some of
us(exc)\add* to see him \add so that we would know that he was alive
again\add*. 
\v 41 God\add did\add* not \add let\add* all the \add Jewish\add* people see him. Instead, he had chosen us
\add apostles\add* beforehand to see \add Jesus after he became alive
again\add* and to tell others \add about him\add*. We \add apostles are the
people\add* who ate meals with him ◄after he had become alive \add again\add*\f + \ft Or: after \f* he had risen from the dead►.
\v 42 God commanded us to preach to the people and tell them that Jesus is the one whom he has appointed to
\add some day\add* judge \add everyone. He will judge all\add* those who will
\add still\add* be living and all those who will have died \add by that
time\add*. 
\v 43 All of the prophets \add who wrote about the Messiah long ago\add* told
\add people\add* about him. \add They wrote\add* that if people believe in the Messiah \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f*, God would forgive
\add them for\add* their sins, because of what \add the Messiah would
do\add* for them.” 
\s Acts 10:44-48 
\s The Holy Spirit came down on the non-Jewish believers. 
\p
\v 44 While Peter was still speaking those words, suddenly the Holy Spirit ◄came down on\f + \ft Or: began \f* to control► all
\add those non-Jewish people\add* who were listening to the message.
\v 45 The Jewish believers who had come with Peter \add from Joppa\add* were amazed that
\add God\add* had generously given the Holy Spirit to the non-Jewish people, too.
\v 46  \add The Jewish believers knew that God had done that\add* because they were hearing those people speaking languages
\\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* \add that they had not learned\add* and telling how great God is.
\v 47 Then Peter said \add to the other Jewish believers who were
there\add*, “\add God\add* has given them the Holy Spirit just like
\add he gave him\add* to us \add Jewish believers\add*, so ◄surely all of you would agree that
\add we(exc)\add* should baptize these people!\f + \ft Or: would \f* any of you forbid that these people should be baptized?► \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f*”
\v 48 Then Peter told those \add non-Jewish\add* people that they should be baptized
\add to show that they had believed\add* \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* in the \add Lord\add* Jesus Christ.
\add So they baptized all of them. After they were baptized\add*, they requested that Peter stay
\add with them\add* several days. \add So Peter and the other Jewish believers did
that\add*.
