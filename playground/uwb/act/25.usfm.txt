\s Acts 25:1-5 
\s Festus told the Jews to go and accuse Paul at Caesarea. 
\p
\v 1 Festus, \add who was now the governor\add* of the province, arrived in Caesarea, and three days later he went up to
Jerusalem. 
\v 2 In Jerusalem, the chief priests and \add other\add* Jewish leaders formally told
\add Festus\add* about \add the things that they said\add* that Paul
\add had done that were wrong\add*. 
\v 3 They urgently asked Festus to do something for them. \add They asked him to command
soldiers\add* to bring Paul to Jerusalem, \add so that Festus could put him on trial
there\add*. But they were planning that some \add of them\add* would hide
\add near the road\add* and wait \add for Paul\add* and kill him when he was traveling
\add to Jerusalem\add*. 
\v 4 But Festus replied, “Paul is in Caesarea, and is being guarded
{\add soldiers\add* are guarding him} \add there\add*. I myself will go down to Caesarea in a few days.
\v 5 Choose some of your leaders to go there with me. \add While they are
there\add*, they can accuse Paul of the wrong things that you say that he has done.”
\s Acts 25:6-12 
\s Paul appealed to Caesar, so Festus agreed to that. 
\p
\v 6 After Festus had been \add in Jerusalem\add* eight or ten days, he went back down to Caesarea.
\add Several of the Jewish leaders also went there\add*. The next day Festus
\add commanded\add* that Paul be brought {someone to bring Paul} to him
\add in the assembly hall\add* so that he could judge him. 
\v 7  \add After\add* Paul was brought to \add the assembly hall\add*, the Jewish
\add leaders\add* from Jerusalem gathered around him \add to accuse
him\add*. They told \add Festus\add* that Paul had committed many crimes. But they could not prove
\add that Paul had done the things about which they accused him\add*.
\v 8 Then Paul \add spoke\add* to defend himself. He said, “I have done nothing wrong against the laws of
us\add (exc)\add* Jews, and I have not disobeyed the rules concerning our Temple. I have also done nothing wrong against your
government \f + \ft metonymy \f*.” 
\v 9 But Festus wanted to please the Jewish \add leaders, so\add* he asked Paul, “Are
you\add (sg)\add* willing to go up to Jerusalem so that I can listen as these men accuse you
\add there\add*?” 
\v 10 But Paul \add did not want to do that. So\add* he said \add to
Festus\add*, “\add No\add*, I \add am not willing to go to Jerusalem!\add* I am
\add now\add* standing before you, and you\add (sg)\add* are the judge
\add whom the Roman\add* Emperor \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add has authorized. This is the
place\add* where I should be judged {where you should judge me}. I have not wronged the Jewish people
\add at all\add*, as you know very well. 
\v 11 If I had done something bad \add for which I\add* should be executed
{\add concerning which the law said that they\add* should execute me}, I would not plead
\add with them that they\add* not kill me. But none of these things about which they accuse me is
\add true, so\add* no one can \add legally\add* surrender me to \add these
Jews\add*. So I formally request that the emperor \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add should judge me at
Rome\add*.” 
\v 12 Then after Festus conferred with the \add men who regularly\add* advised him, he replied to Paul,
“You\add (sg)\add* have formally requested \add that I should send
you\add* to the emperor \add in Rome. So I will arrange for\add* you to go
there\add in order that he can judge you\add*.” 
\s Acts 25:13-22 
\s Festus told King Agrippa about Paul. 
\p
\v 13 After several days, King \add Herod\add* Agrippa arrived at Caesarea, along with
\add his younger sister\add* Bernice. They had come to \add formally\add* welcome Festus
\add as the new Governor of the province\add*. 
\v 14 King Agrippa and Bernice stayed many days in Caesarea. While
\add they were\add* there, Festus told Agrippa about Paul. He said to the king, “There is a man here whom Felix kept in
prison\add while he was governor\add*. He left him\add there when his time as governor
ended\add*. 
\v 15 When I went to Jerusalem, the chief priests and \add the other\add* Jewish elders told me that this man had done many
things \add against their laws\add*. They asked me to condemn him
\add to be executed\add* {judge him \add so that people could kill
him\add*}. 
\v 16 But I told them that when someone has been accused \add of a crime,
we\add* Romans do not immediately condemn that person\f + \ft Or: declare that person to be guilty \f*. First, we
\add command\add* him to stand before the people who are accusing him and to say whether or not he has done those things.
\add After that, the judge will decide what to do with\add* him.
\v 17 So those Jews came \add here to Caesarea\add* when I came. I did not delay. The day after
\add we(exc) arrived\add*, after I sat down at the place where I make decisions, I
\add commanded\add* that Paul be brought {\add soldiers\add* to bring Paul} into
\add the courtroom\add*. 
\v 18 The Jewish leaders did accuse him, but the things about which they accused him were not any of the
\add evil\add* crimes about which I thought \add they would accuse
him\add*. 
\v 19 Instead, what they argued about with him were some teachings that
\add some\add* Jews believe \add and others do not believe. They
argued\add* about a man whose name was Jesus who had died, \add but the man they were accusing, whose name
is\add* Paul, kept saying, ‘Jesus is alive again.’ 
\v 20 I did not know what questions to ask \add them, and I did not know how to
judge\add* concerning their dispute. So I asked Paul, ‘Are you\add (sg)\add* willing to go
\add back\add* to Jerusalem and have the dispute \add between you and these
Jews\add* judged there {and \add let me\add* judge there the dispute
\add between you and these Jews\add*}?’ 
\v 21 But Paul answered, ‘\add No\add*. I \add am not willing to go to
Jerusalem!\add* I \add want you(sg) to\add* request that the emperor
\add in Rome\add* judge my affair, \add and I will wait here as a prisoner until
then\add*.’ So I have \add commanded\add* that Paul be guarded {\add soldiers\add* to guard Paul} here until I can send him to
the emperor \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add in Rome\add*.” 
\v 22 Then Agrippa said to Festus, “I myself would like to hear what that man
\add says\add*.” Festus answered, “\add I will arrange for\add* you\add (sg)\add* to hear him tomorrow.”
\s Acts 25:23-27 
\s Festus asked King Agrippa to tell him what to write to Caesar about Paul.
\p
\v 23 The next day Agrippa and Bernice came very ceremoniously to the assembly hall. Some
\add Roman\add* commanders and prominent men in \add Caesarea\add* came with them. Then, Festus told an officer to bring Paul.
So after the officer \add went\add* \add to the prison and\add* brought him,
\v 24 Festus said, “King Agrippa, and all \add the rest of you\add* who are here, you see this man. Many \f + \ft hyperbole \f* Jews in
Jerusalem and also those here \add in Caesarea\add* appealed to me, screaming that
we\add (exc)\add* should not let him live any longer. 
\v 25 But \add when I asked them to tell me what he had done, and they told
me\add*, I found out that he had not done anything for which he should be executed
{\add anyone should\add* execute him}. However, he has asked that our emperor
\add should judge his case\add*, so I have decided to send him to Rome.
\v 26 But I do not know what specifically I should write to the emperor concerning him. That is why I have brought him here. I
\add want\add* you all \add to hear him speak\add*, and I especially want
you\add (sg)\add*, King Agrippa, to hear him. Then, after we\add (inc)\add* have questioned him, I may know what I should write
\add to the emperor about him\add*. 
\v 27 It seems to me \add that it would be\add* unreasonable to send a prisoner
\add to the emperor in Rome without my\add* specifying the \add things about which
people\add* are accusing him.”
