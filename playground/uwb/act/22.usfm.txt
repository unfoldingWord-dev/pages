\c 22  
\s Acts 22:1-16 
\s Paul defended his believing in Jesus, but the Jews wanted to kill him.
\p
\v 1 Paul said, "\add Jewish\add* elders and my other fellow Jews, listen to me now while I reply to
\add those who are accusing me\add*!" 
\v 2 When the crowd of people heard Paul speaking to them in \add their
own\add* Hebrew language, they became even more quiet and really listened. Then Paul said to them,
\v 3 "I am a Jew, \add as are all of you\add*. I was born in Tarsus
\add city\add*, in Cilicia \add province\add*, but I grew up here in Jerusalem.
\add When I was young, for many years\add* I studied the laws \add that Moses gave to our
ancestors\add*. I was taught by \add the famous teacher\add* Gamaliel \f + \ft metonymy \f*
\f + \ft Or:\add The famous teacher\add* Gamaliel taught \f + \ft metonymy \f* me \f*. \add I have\add* carefully
\add obeyed those laws, because\add* I have wanted to obey God. I
\add am sure that\add* many of you also carefully obey \add those
laws\add*. 
\v 4  \add That is why\add* I previously persecuted those who believe the message
\add that people call\add* the Way \add that Jesus taught. I continually looked for
ways\add* to kill \add them. Whenever I found\add* men or women \add who believed that
message\add*, I \add commanded that\add* they should be seized and thrown
\f + \ft Or:\add people to\add* seize them and throw them \f* into jail. 
\v 5 The high priest knows this, and so do the \add other respected men who belong to our
Jewish\add* Council. They gave me letters to \add take to\add* their fellow Jews in Damascus
\add city. By means of those letters, they authorized me to\add* go to there and find people who believed in
\add Jesus. They had written in the letters that I was to bring those
people\add* as prisoners to Jerusalem, so that they would be punished here
\f + \ft Or:\add the leaders here\add* could punish them \f*. 
\p \add So I went on my way to Damascus\add*. 
\v 6 About noon, I and my companions were getting near Damascus. Suddenly a bright light from the sky flashed all around me.
\v 7  \add The light was so bright that\add* I fell to the ground. Then I heard the voice
\add of someone\add* speaking to me \add from up in the sky. The one who was speaking to me
said\add*, 'Saul! Saul! Why do you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* do things to harm me?'
\v 8 I answered, 'Who are you, Sir?' He replied, 'I am Jesus from Nazareth. I
\add am the one\add* whom you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* are harming \add by doing things to harm my
followers\add*.' 
\v 9 The men who were \add traveling\add* with me saw the \add very
bright\add* light, \add and they heard a voice\add*, but they did not understand what the voice said to me.
\v 10 Then I asked, 'Lord, what \add do you want\add* me to do?' The Lord told me, 'Get up and go into Damascus!
\add A man\add* there will tell you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* all that I have planned for you to do.'
\v 11  \add After that, I could not see\add*, because the \add very
bright\add* light had caused me to become blind. So my companions took me by the hand and led me until
\add we\f + \ft exclusive \f* arrived\add* in Damascus. 
\v 12  \add A couple of days\add* later, a man whose name was Ananias came to
\add see\add* me. He was a man who \add greatly respected God and\add* carefully obeyed
\add our Jewish\add* laws. All the Jews living in Damascus said good things about him.
\v 13 He came and stood beside me and said to me, '\add My\add* friend Saul, see
\add again\add*!' Instantly I could see! I saw him \add standing there beside
me\add*. 
\v 14 Then he said: 'The God whom \add we\f + \ft inclusive \f* worship and\add* whom our ancestors
\add worshipped\add* has chosen you and will show you what he wants
\add you to do. He has allowed you\add* to see the righteous one,
\add the Messiah\add*, and you have heard him speaking \add to you\add*.
\v 15 He wants you to tell people everywhere what you have seen and heard
\add from him\add*. 
\v 16 So now do not delay!\f + \ft Or: why delay? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* Stand up, let \add me\add* baptize you, and by praying to the Lord
\add Jesus ask God\add* to forgive you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* for your sins!' "
\s Acts 22:17-22 
\s Paul told about the Lord's commanding him to go to non-Jewish people.
\p
\v 17 "Later, I returned to Jerusalem. \add One day\add* I went to the Temple courtyard. While I was praying there, I saw a
vision \add in which\add* 
\v 18 I saw the Lord speaking to me. He said to me, '\add Do not stay
here!\add* Leave Jerusalem immediately, because the people \add here\add* will not believe\f + \ft Or: listen to \f* what
you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* tell \add them\add* about me!' 
\v 19 But I \add protested and\add* said to him, 'Lord, they know that I went to many of our meeting houses looking for people
who believe in you. I was putting in jail those \add whom I found\add* who believed in you, and I was even beating them.
\v 20  \add They remember that\add* when Stephen was killed \f + \ft metonymy \f* \f + \ft Or:when people killed ( metonymy ) Stephen \f* because he told people
about you, I stood there \add watching it all\add* and approving
\add what they were doing\add*. I \add even\add* guarded the outer garments that those who were murdering him
\add had thrown aside\add*! \add So if I stay here, the fact that I have changed how I think about you will surely impress
those leaders of our people\add*.' 
\v 21 But the Lord said to me, 'No, \add do not stay here\add*! Leave
\add Jerusalem, because\add* I am going to send you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* far away
\add from here\add* to non-Jewish people!' " 
\v 22 The people listened \add quietly\add* to what Paul was saying until
\add he mentioned the Lord sending him to non-Jewish people\add*. Then they began shouting
\add angrily\add*, "Kill him! \add He does not deserve to live any
longer\add*!" \add They said that because they could not believe that God would save anyone except
Jews\add*. 
\s Acts 22:23-29 
\s Paul said that he was a Roman citizen, so soldiers did not flog him.
\p
\v 23 While they continued shouting, \add "Kill him!"\add* they took off their cloaks and threw dust into the air,
\add which showed how angry they were\add*. 
\v 24 So the commander \add commanded\add* that Paul be taken \f + \ft Or:\add soldiers\add* to take Paul \f* into the barracks. He told
\add the soldiers\add* that they should strike Paul with a whip \add that had pieces of bone\f + \ft Or: metal \f* on the end of
it\add*, in order to make him tell what he had done that made the Jews shout so angrily.
\add So the soldiers took Paul into the barracks\add*. 
\v 25 Then they stretched his arms out \add and tied them\add* so that they could whip him
\add on his back. But\add* Paul said to the officer who was standing nearby
\add watching\add*, "\add You\f + \ft singular \f* should think carefully about this!\add* You will certainly be \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* acting unlawfully if you
whip me, a Roman \add citizen whom\add* no \add one has put on trial
and\add* condemned!" 
\v 26 When the officer heard that, he went to the commander and reported it to him. He said
\add to the commander\add*, "This man is a Roman \add citizen\add*! Surely you would not
\add command us to whip him\add*!\f + \ft Or: Do you really want \add us to whip
him\add*? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*" 
\v 27 The commander \add was surprised when he heard that. He himself\add* went
\add into the barracks\add* and said to Paul, "Tell me, are you\add \f + \ft singular \f*
really\add* a Roman \add citizen\add*?" Paul answered, "Yes, I \add am\add*."
\v 28 Then the commander said, "\add I am also a Roman citizen\add*. I paid a lot of money to become a
\add Roman\add* citizen." Paul said, "But I was born a \add Roman\add* citizen,
\add so I did not need to pay anything\add*." 
\v 29 The soldiers \add were about to whip Paul and to ask him questions about what he had done. But when they heard what Paul
said, they\add* left him immediately. The commander also became afraid, because he realized that Paul was a Roman
\add citizen\add* and that he had \add illegally commanded soldiers
to\add* tie up Paul's \add hands\add*. 
\s Acts 22:30 
\s The commander's soldiers brought Paul to the Jewish Council. 
\p
\v 30  \add The commander still\add* wanted to know exactly why the Jews were accusing Paul. So the next day he
\add told the soldiers to\add* take the chains off Paul. He also summoned the chief priests and the
\add other Jewish\add* Council \add members\add*. Then he took Paul
\add to where the Council was meeting\add* and \add commanded\add* him to stand before them.
