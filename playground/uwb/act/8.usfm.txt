\p
\v 1-2 Then some men who revered God buried Stephen's body in a tomb, and they mourned greatly and loudly for him.
\p On that same day \add people\add* started severely persecuting the believers
\add who were living\add* in Jerusalem. So most \add of the believers\add* fled
\add to other places\add* throughout Judea and Samaria \add provinces\add*. The apostles were the only
\add believers who remained in Jerusalem\add*. 
\v 3 While they were killing Stephen, Saul was there approving that they should kill Stephen. So Saul
\add also\add* began trying to destroy the group of believers. He entered houses one by one, he dragged away men and women
\add who believed in Jesus\add*, and then he \add arranged for\add* them to be put in prison.
\s Acts 8:4-8 
\s Many Samaritans heeded Philip's words and rejoiced. 
\p
\v 4 The believers who had left Jerusalem went to different places, where they continued preaching the message about Jesus.
\v 5  \add One of those believers whose name was\add* Philip went down
\add from Jerusalem\add* to a city in Samaria \add province\add*. There he was telling
\add the people that Jesus is\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* the Messiah. 
\v 6 Many people there heard Philip \add speak\add* and saw the miraculous things that he was doing. So they all paid close
attention to\f + \ft Or: listened carefully to \f* his words. 
\v 7 For \add example, when Philip commanded\add* evil spirits who controlled many people
\add that they should come out of them\add*, they came out, while those spirits screamed. Also, many people who were paralyzed
and \add many others\add* who were lame were healed. 
\v 8 So \add many people\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* in that city greatly rejoiced.
\s Acts 8:9-13 
\s Philip baptized many Samaritans, including a sorcerer. 
\p
\v 9 There was a man in that city whose name was Simon. He had been practicing sorcery for a long time and he had been amazing
the people in Samaria \add province by doing that\add*. He continually claimed that he was a great\f + \ft Or: important \f* person.
\v 10 All the people there, both ordinary and important people, listened to him.
\add Various ones of\add* them were saying, "This man works in extremely powerful ways
\add because\add* God has caused him to be a great \add person\add*."
\v 11 They continued to listen to him carefully, because for a long time he had astonished them by practicing sorcery.
\v 12 But then they believed Philip's \add message\add* when he preached to them about
\add how\add* God desires to rule \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add the lives of people who believe in
him\add*, and about Jesus being the Messiah \f + \ft metonymy \f*. Both the men and the women who believed in Jesus were baptized.
{\add Philip\add* was baptizing both the men and the women \add who had come to believe in
Jesus\add*}. 
\v 13 Simon himself believed \add Philip's message\add* and, after he was baptized {after
\add Philip\add* baptized him}, he began to constantly accompany Philip. Simon was continually amazed because he often saw
\add Philip\add* doing many kinds of miraculous things. 
\s Acts 8:14-17 
\s Samaritan believers received the power of the Holy Spirit. 
\p
\v 14 When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that \add many people\add* \f + \ft personification \f*
\add throughout\add* Samaria \add district\add* had believed the message from God
\add about Jesus\add*, they sent Peter and John there. 
\v 15 When Peter and John arrived in Samaria, they prayed for those
\add new believers\add* in order that the Holy Spirit's \add power\add* would come to them.
\v 16  \add Peter and John realized that\add* the Holy Spirit had not yet begun to empower any of them. They had been baptized
{\add Philip\add* had baptized them} \add because they had believed\add* in \f + \ft metonymy \f* the Lord Jesus,
\add but they did not know about the Holy Spirit\add*. 
\v 17  \add Then Peter and John\add* placed their hands on \add the heads
of\add* each person, and they received the \add power of\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* the Holy Spirit.
\s Acts 8:18-24 
\s Peter denounced Simon the sorcerer. 
\p
\v 18 Simon saw \add things that convinced him\add* that \add God\add* had given the Spirit's
\add power to people\add* as a result of the apostles placing their hands on them. So he offered
\add to give\add* money to the apostles, 
\v 19 saying, "Enable me also to do what \add you are doing\add*, so that everyone on whom I place\f + \ft Or: put \f* my hands may receive the
Holy Spirit's \add power\add*." 
\v 20 But Peter said to him, "May you\add (sg)\add* and your money go to hell, because you
\add mistakenly\add* think that you can buy \add from us\add* what God
\add alone\add* gives to \add people\add*! 
\v 21  \add God\add* has not authorized you to have any part of this ministry of giving
\add the Holy Spirit's power\add*, because he knows that you are not thinking rightly! \f + \ft Or: because he knows that you are
thinking completely wrongly. \f* 
\v 22 So stop thinking wickedly \add like\add* that, and plead that the Lord, if he is willing, will forgive you
\add for what\add* you \add wickedly\add* thought\f + \ft Or: planned \f* \add to
do\add*! 
\v 23  \add Turn away from your evil ways\add*, because I perceive that
you\add (sg)\add* are extremely envious of \add us\add*, and you
\add are\add* a slave of your \add continual desire to do evil! God will certainly punish you
severely!\add*" 
\v 24 Then Simon answered, "Pray to the Lord \add God\add* that \add he\add* will not do to me what you just said!"
\s Acts 8:25 
\s Peter and John preached to many Samaritans. 
\p
\v 25 After \add Peter and John\add* told \add people there\add* what they knew personally
\add about the\add* Lord\add Jesus\add* and declared to them the message about Jesus, they both returned to Jerusalem.
\add Along the way\add* they preached the good message \add about Jesus to
people\add* in many villages in Samaria \add province\add*. 
\s Acts 8:26-28 
\s Philip met an Ethiopian official. 
\p
\v 26  \add One day\add* an angel whom the Lord \add God\add* had sent commanded Philip, "Get ready and go south along the road
that extends from Jerusalem to Gaza." \add That was\add* a road in a desert area.
\v 27 So Philip got ready and went \add along that road\add*. Suddenly he met a man from Ethiopia
\add country. He was\add* an important official who took care of all the funds for the queen
\add of\add* Ethiopia. \add In his language people called their queen\add* Candace. This man had gone to Jerusalem to worship
\add God\add*, 
\v 28 and he was returning \add home\add* and was seated \add riding\add* in his chariot.
\add As he was riding\add*, he was reading \add out loud from\add* what the prophet Isaiah
\add had written\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add long ago\add*. 
\s Acts 8:29-31 
\s The official could not understand what he was reading. 
\p
\v 29  \add God's\add* Spirit told Philip, "Go near to that chariot and keep walking close to
\add the man who is riding in\add* it!" 
\v 30 So Philip ran \add to the chariot and kept running close to
it\add*. Then he heard the official reading what the prophet Isaiah
\add had written\add*. He asked the man, "Do you\add (sg)\add* understand what you are reading?"
\v 31 He answered Philip, "\add No!\add* I cannot possibly\add understand
it\add* if \add there is\add* no one to explain it to me!\f + \ft Or: How can I
\add understand it\add* if \add there is\add* no one to explain it to me? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*"
\s Acts 8:31b-35 
\s Philip preached about Jesus to the official. 
\p Then the man said to Philip, "Please come up \add and\add* sit beside me."
\add So Philip did that\add*. 
\v 32 The part of the Scriptures that the official was reading was this:
\q He will \add be silent when\add* they lead him away to kill him
\q \add like when people lead\add* a sheep \add away to kill it\add*.
\q As a young sheep is silent when its wool is being cut off {someone cuts off its wool},
\add similarly\add* he will not protest \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add when people cause him to
suffer\add*. 
\q
\v 33 When he will be humiliated by being accused falsely {people will humiliate
him\add by accusing him falsely\add*}, 
\q \add the rulers\add* will not consider him innocent\f + \ft Or: will consider him guilty \f*.
\q No one will possibly be able to tell about his descendants, because he will be killed {people will kill him} without him
having\add any descendants\add* on the earth. 
\p
\v 34 The official asked Philip \add concerning these words that he was
reading\add*, "Tell me, who was the prophet writing about? \add Was he
writing\add* about himself or about someone else?" 
\v 35 So Philip replied \f + \ft metonymy \f* to him and began \add to explain\add* that Scripture passage. He told him the good message about
\f + \ft metonymy \f* Jesus. \add So the official understood and believed in Jesus\add*.
\s Acts 8:36-39 
\s Philip baptized the official. Then the Spirit took Philip away.
\p
\v 36-37 While they were traveling along the road, they came to \add a place where there was a pond
of\add* water \add near the road\add*. Then the official said \add to
Philip\add*, "Look, \add there is a pond of\add* water! I would like you to baptize me, because I do not know of anything that
would prevent me from being baptized {prevent \add you\add* from baptizing me.}\f + \ft Or: Do you know of anything that would prevent me
from being baptized {prevent \add you\add* from baptizing me}? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*"
\v 38 So the official told \add the driver\add* to stop the chariot. Then both Philip and the official went down into the
\add pond of\add* water, and \add Philip\add* baptized him. 
\v 39 When they came up out of the water, suddenly God's Spirit took Philip away. The official never saw Philip again. But
\add although he never saw Philip again\add*, the official continued going along the road, very happy
\add that God had saved him\add*. 
\s Acts 8:40 
\s Philip preached in towns from Azotus to Caesarea. 
\p
\v 40 Philip then realized \add that the Spirit had miraculously taken him
to\add* Azotus \add town\add*. While he traveled around \add in that
region\add*, he continued proclaiming the message \add about Jesus\add* in all the towns
\add between Azotus and Caesarea. And he was still proclaiming\add* it when he finally arrived in Caesarea
\add city\add*.
