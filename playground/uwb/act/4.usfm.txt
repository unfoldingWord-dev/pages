\c 4  
\s Acts 4:1-4 
\s Jewish leaders arrested Peter and John, but many people became believers.
\p
\v 1  \add Meanwhile, in the temple courtyard, there were some\add* priests, the officer who was in charge of the temple
police, and \add also some\add* \f + \ft synecdoche \f* Sadducee \add sect members\add*. These men came to Peter and John while the two of them
were speaking to the people. 
\v 2 These men were very angry, because the \add two\add* apostles were teaching the people
\add about Jesus\add*. What they were telling them was that because
\add God caused Jesus to become alive again\f + \ft Or: God raised\add* Jesus
\add from the dead\add* \f*, \add God\add* would cause other people who had died to become alive again.
\v 3 So those officials seized Peter and John. Then they put them in jail.
\add They had to wait\add* until the next day \add to question Peter and
John\add*, because it was already evening \add and it was contrary to their Jewish law to question people at
night\add*. 
\v 4 However, many people who had heard the message \add from Peter\add* believed
\add in Jesus\add*. \f + \ft Or: But many people had \add already\add* believed
\add in Jesus, because\add* they had heard the message \add from
Peter\add*. \f* So the number of men \add who believed in Jesus\add* increased to about five thousand.
\s Acts 4:5-7 
\s Jewish leaders questioned Peter and John about healing the lame man.
\p
\v 5 The next day \add the high priest summoned\add* the \add other\add* chief priests, the teachers of the
\add Jewish\add* laws, and the other members \add of the Jewish Council, and
they\add* gathered together \add in one place\add* in Jerusalem.
\v 6 Annas, \add the former\add* high priest, Caiaphas \add who was the new high
priest\add*, \add two other former high priests whose names were\add* John and Alexander, and other men who were related to the
high priest \add were there\add*. 
\v 7 They \add commanded guards to\add* bring Peter and John into the courtroom \f + \ft metonymy \f* and have them stand in front of them.
\add Then one of\add* the leaders questioned \add the two of\add* them, saying, "Who
\add do you two claim\add* gave you the power \add to heal this man\add*? And who authorized \f + \ft metonymy \f* you to do this \f + \ft doublet \f*?"
\s Acts 4:8-12 
\s Peter told them that Jesus healed the man and only Jesus could save people.
\p
\v 8 So as the Holy Spirit completely controlled Peter, he said to them, "You
\add fellow Israelites\add* who rule us and \add all of you other\add* elders,
\add listen\add*! 
\v 9 Today you are questioning us concerning our performing a good deed for a man who was crippled, and you asked us how he
became healed. 
\v 10 So \add we\f + \ft exclusive \f* want\add* you and all \add of our other\add* fellow Israelites to know this: It is because Jesus the
Messiah \f + \ft metonymy \f* from Nazareth healed him that this man is able to stand before you.
\add God considers that\add* it was you who nailed Jesus to a cross, but God caused him to become alive again.
\v 11  \add In the Psalms this was written about the Messiah:\add*
\q He is \add like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* the stone that was rejected by the builders \f + \ft Or:that the builders rejected \f*.
\q But that stone became the most important stone in the building
\add that they were building\add*. 
\p \add Jesus is that stone, and\add* you \add are those builders who threw away the stone that was the most important
one\add*. 
\v 12 So he alone can save us \f + \ft metonymy \f*. \add God\add* has sent only one person \f + \ft metonymy \f* into the world who can save us
\add from the guilt of our sins, and that person is Jesus!\add*"
\s Acts 4:13-14 
\s The Jewish leaders realized that Peter and John had been associating with Jesus.
\p
\v 13 The \add Jewish leaders\add* realized that Peter and John were not afraid
\add of them\add*\f + \ft Or: spoke boldly \f*. They also learned that the two men were ordinary people who had not studied in schools. So the
leaders were amazed, and they realized that these men had associated with Jesus.
\v 14 They also saw the man who had been healed standing there with
\add the two of\add* them, so they were not able to say anything
\add to oppose Peter and John\add*. 
\s Acts 4:15-18 
\s The Jewish leaders commanded the two apostles to stop teaching people about Jesus.
\p
\v 15 So the \add Jewish leaders\add* commanded \add guards\add* to take Peter, John, and the man outside of the room
\add where those leaders were meeting. After they did so\add*, the leaders talked with each other
\add about Peter and John\add*. 
\v 16  \add Being frustrated, one after another\add*, said, "There is really nothing that we can do to
\add punish\add* these \add two\add* men!\f + \ft Or: How can we\add \f + \ft inclusive \f*\add* do anything to
\add punish\add* these \add two\add* men? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* Almost everyone \f + \ft hyperbole \f* who is living in Jerusalem knows that they have done an
amazing miracle, so we cannot tell people that it did not happen!
\v 17 However, \add we\add* must not allow other people to hear about
\add this miracle\add*. So we must tell these men that \add we will punish them if
they\add* continue to tell other people about this \f + \ft metonymy \f* man \add who they say gave them the power to do
it\add*." 
\v 18 So the Jewish leaders \add commanded guards\add* to bring the two apostles
\add into that room again. After they did so\add*, they \add commanded\add* them both that they should never speak about Jesus,
and they should not teach \add anyone about him\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add again\add*.
\s Acts 4:19-20 
\s Peter and John said that they needed to continue speaking about Jesus.
\p
\v 19 But Peter and John replied, "Would God think that it is right
\add for us two\add* to obey you and not \add to obey\add* him? \add We\f + \ft exclusive \f* will
let\add* you decide \add what you think is proper\add*. 
\v 20  \add But as for us, we cannot obey you\add*. We will not stop telling people about the things that
we\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* have seen \add Jesus do\add* and what we have heard
\add him teach\add*." 
\s Acts 4:21-22 
\s The Jewish leaders threatened to punish Peter and John and then released them.
\p
\v 21-22 Then the \add Jewish leaders\add* again told \add Peter and
John\add* not to disobey them. But all the people \add there\add* were praising God about what had happened
\add to the lame man. They leaders knew that only God could have enabled Peter and
John\add* to miraculously heal the man, because the man was more than forty years old
\add and he was lame when his mother bore him. They also knew that the people would become angry if they punished the two
apostles\add*. So, because they could not decide how to punish Peter and John,
\add they finally\add* let them go. 
\s Acts 4:23-28 
\s The believers talked to God about those who opposed him and them.
\p
\v 23 After Peter and John had been released, they went to the other believers and reported all that the chief priests and
\add other Jewish\add* elders had said to them. 
\v 24 When they heard that, they \add all\add* agreed as they prayed to God, and
\add one of\add* them prayed, "O Lord! You\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* made the sky, the earth and the oceans, and everything in them.
\v 25 The Holy Spirit caused our ancestor, \add King\add* David \f + \ft metonymy \f*, who served you, to write these words:
\q \add It is ridiculous\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* that the non-Jews became angry and the Israelite people planned uselessly
\add against God\add*. 
\q
\v 26 The kings in the world prepared to fight\add God's Ruler\add*, and the
\add other\add* rulers assembled together \add with them\add* to oppose the Lord
\add God\add* and the one whom he had appointed \add to be the Messiah\add*.
\p
\v 27  \add We know that what you\f + \ft singular \f* said long ago was true\add*, because
\add King\add* Herod and the \add governor\add*, Pontius Pilate, and many other people, both non-Jews and Israelites, assembled
together \add here\add* in this city. \add They\add* planned \add to
kill\add* Jesus, who devotedly served you \add and\add* whom you appointed \f + \ft metonymy \f*
\add to be the Messiah\add*. 
\v 28  \add Because\add* you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* are all-powerful, those people did
\add only\add* what you \f + \ft synecdoche \f* allowed \add them to do\add*. It was what you decided long ago would happen."
\s Acts 4:29-30 
\s The believers asked God to help them speak boldly to people about Jesus.
\p
\v 29 "So now, Lord, listen to what they are saying about punishing us! Help us who serve
you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* to very boldly speak messages from you\add \f + \ft singular \f* about
Jesus\add*! 
\v 30  \add Also\add*, by your power \f + \ft metonymy \f* miraculously heal \add sick
people\add* and do other amazing miracles \f + \ft synecdoche \f* that show people your power! Ask Jesus, who always serves you,
\add to give us the authority\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add to do such miracles!\add*"
\s Acts 4:31 
\s God shook the place where they were, and his Spirit enabled them to speak his words boldly.
\p
\v 31 When the believers had finished praying, the place where they were meeting shook. All of them were completely
controlled\f + \ft Or: empowered \f* by the Holy Spirit \f + \ft Or:the Holy Spirit completely controlled( Or: empowered ) all of them \f*, with the result that
they began to speak boldly the words that God \add told them to speak\add*.
\s Acts 4:32-35 
\s The believers shared everything, and the apostles told others about Jesus.
\p
\v 32 The group of people who had believed \add in Jesus\add* were completely agreed about what they thought and what they
wanted\f + \ft Or: desired \f*. Not one of them claimed that he \add alone\add* owned anything. Instead, they shared with one another
everything that they had. 
\v 33 The apostles continued to tell others, very powerfully, \add that
God\add* had caused the Lord Jesus to become alive again\f + \ft Or: raised the Lord Jesus from the dead \f*.
\add People knew that God\add* was graciously helping all the believers.
\v 34  \add Some of\add* the believers who owned land or houses would occasionally sell
\add some of\add* their property. Then they would bring \add the money for what they
sold\add* 
\v 35 and they would present it to the apostles \f + \ft metonymy \f*. Then \add the
apostles\add* would give money to any \add believer\add* who needed
\add it\add*. So no one among the believers was lacking anything.
\s Acts 4:36-37 
\s Joseph Barnabas sold a field and brought the money to the apostles.
\p
\v 36  \add For example, there was\add* Joseph. \add He was\add* a descendant of Levi
\add and he was born\add* on Cyprus \add Island\add*. The apostles called him Barnabas;
\add in the Jewish language\add* that name means a person who \f + \ft idiom \f* always encourages
\add others\add*. 
\v 37 He sold one of his fields, and brought the money to the apostles
\add for them to distribute to other believers\add*.
