\s Acts 28:1-6 
\s The Maltese thought that Paul was a god because a snake did not harm him.
\p
\v 1 After we\add (exc)\add* had arrived safely \add on the shore\add*, we learned that it was an island called Malta.
\v 2 The people who lived there received us kindly. They lit a fire and invited us to come and warm ourselves, because it was
raining and it was cold. 
\v 3 Paul gathered some sticks and put them on the fire. But \add among those sticks
was\add* a snake that had come out \add from the fire to escape\add* from the heat, and it fastened itself on Paul's hand.
\v 4  \add The islanders knew that the snake was poisonous, so\add* when they saw it hanging from Paul's hand, they said to
each other, “Probably this man has murdered someone. Although he has escaped from being drowned,
\add the god\add* ◄\add who\add* pays \add people back/who punishes
people\add*► for their \f + \fr metonymy \f* sins will to cause him to die.” 
\v 5 But Paul simply shook the snake off into the fire, and nothing happened to him.
\v 6 The people were expecting that Paul's body would soon swell up or that he would suddenly fall down and die. But after they
had waited a long time, they saw \add that the snake\add* had not harmed him
\add at all\add*. So then the people changed what they were thinking and said
\add to one another\add*, “This man is not a murderer! Probably he is a god!”
\s Acts 28:7-10 
\s Paul healed many Maltese, so they supplied what he and the others needed.
\p
\v 7 Near where the people had made the fire, there were some fields that belonged to a man whose name was Publius. He was the
chief official on the island. He invited us to \add come and stay
in\add* his home. He took care of us for three days. 
\v 8  \add At that time\add* Publius' father had fever and dysentery, and he was lying
\add in bed\add*. So Paul visited him and prayed \add for him. Then\add* Paul placed his hands on him and healed him.
\v 9 After Paul had done that, the other people on the island who were sick came
\add to him\add* and \add he\add* healed them, too. 
\v 10 They brought us gifts and \add showed in other ways that\add* they greatly respected us. When we were
\add ready\add* to leave \add three months later\add*, they brought us food and other things that we would need
\add on the ship\add*. 
\s Acts 28:11-14 
\s Paul and the others sailed to Puteoli, then went by land towards Rome.
\p
\v 11 After \add we had stayed there\add* three months, we \add got
on\add* a ship \add that was going to Italy and\add* sailed away. The ship had been in
\add a harbor on\add* the island during the months when there are many storms. It had come from Alexandria
\add city\add*. On the front of the ship there were carved images of the twin gods
\add whose names were Castor and Pollux\add*. 
\v 12 We \add sailed from the island and\add* arrived at Syracuse
\add city on Sicily island\add* and stayed there three days. 
\v 13 Then we traveled on by ship and arrived at Rhegium \add port in
Italy\add*. The next day, the wind was blowing from behind us, \add so we sailed along
fast\add*. The day after that, we reached Puteoli \add town, where we left the
ship\add*. 
\v 14 In Puteoli we met some believers who invited us to stay with them for a week.
\add After visiting them\add*, we \add left there and started to travel by
land\add* to Rome. 
\s Acts 28:15-16 
\s Christians came out from Rome and escorted Paul into that city.
\p
\v 15  \add A group of\add* believers \add who lived in Rome\add* had heard that
we\add (exc) were coming\add*. So they came out \add from Rome\add* to meet us.
\add Some of\add* them met us at \add the town called\add* 'The Market on Appian
\add Road,'\add* and others met us at \add the town called\add* 'The Three Inns.' When Paul saw those believers, he thanked God
and was encouraged. 
\v 16 After we\add (exc)\add* arrived in Rome, Paul was permitted
{\add a Roman official who was responsible for guarding Paul\add* permitted Paul} to live
\add in a house\add* by himself. But\add there was always\add* a soldier there to guard him.
\s Acts 28:17-22 
\s The Jewish leaders asked Paul to tell them about Christianity.
\p
\v 17 After \add Paul had been there\add* three days, he sent a message to the Jewish leaders
\add to come and talk with him. So\add* they came, and Paul said to them, “My fellow Jews, although I have not opposed our
people nor spoken against the customs of our ancestors, \add our
leaders\add* in Jerusalem \add seized\add* \f + \fr metonymy \f* \add me. But before they could kill me, a Roman commander rescued me and later
sent me\add* to Caesarea for Roman \add authorities/officials to put me on
trial\add*. 
\v 18 The Roman authorities/officials questioned me and wanted to release me, because I had not done any
\add bad\add* thing for which I should be executed {they should kill me}.
\v 19 But when the Jewish \add leaders\add* \f + \fr synecdoche \f* there opposed \add what the Roman authorities wanted to
do\add*, I had to formally request that the Emperor \add judge me here in
Rome\add*. But my reason for doing that was not that I wanted to accuse our leaders about anything.
\v 20 So I have requested you \add to come\add* here so that I can tell you why I am a prisoner. It is because I believe in
\f + \fr metonymy \f* our Messiah, the one \add God long ago promised to send\add* to
us\add (inc)\add* Jews.” 
\v 21 Then \add the Jewish leaders\add* said, “We\add (exc)\add* have not received any letters from
\add our fellow Jews\add* in Judea about you. Also, none of our fellow Jews who have arrived
\add here from Judea\add* has said anything bad about you. 
\v 22 But we\add (exc)\add* want to hear what you\add (sg)\add* think about this
\add Christian\add* sect/group, because we know that in many places \f + \fr hyperbole \f* bad things are being said {people are saying bad
things} about it.” 
\s Acts 28:23-31 
\s Paul told the Jews that non-Jews would believe the gospel. 
\p
\v 23 So they \add talked with Paul and decided that they would come back on another day to hear him. When that day
arrived\add*, those Jews came back to the place where Paul was staying, and they brought more Jews with them. Paul talked to
them from morning until evening. He talked to them about how God wants to rule
\add people's lives\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f*. He tried to convince them that Jesus
\add is the Messiah\add* by reminding them what Moses and the other prophets had written \f + \fr metonymy \f*.
\v 24 Some of those Jews believed that what was said \add by Paul\add* {what
\add Paul\add* said} about Jesus \add was true\add*, but others did not believe
\add that it was true\add*. 
\v 25 So they began to argue with one another. \add Paul realized that some of them did not want to listen to him,
so\add* when they were about to leave, he said, “The Holy Spirit said something to your/our(incl) ancestors. He spoke these
words to Isaiah the prophet, \add and what he said is also true about
you\add*, 
\q
\v 26 Go to your fellow Israelites and tell them, 
\q ‘You repeatedly listen \add to the message of God\add*, but you never understand
\add what God is saying\add*. 
\q You repeatedly look at and see \add the things that God is doing\add*,
\q but you never understand \add what they mean\add*. 
\q
\v 27 God also said to the prophet, 
\q These people do not understand, because they have become stubborn.
\q They have ears, but they do not understand what they hear, 
\q and they have closed their eyes \add because they do not want to
see\add*. 
\q If they wanted to obey what I say to them, they might understand with their hearts what they see
\add me doing\add* and what they hear \add me saying\add*. 
\q Then they might turn from their sinful behavior and I would save them.’
\p
\v 28-29  \add That is what God said to the prophet Isaiah about our ancestors. But you Jews today do not want to believe God's
message\add*. Therefore, I am telling you that \add God\add* has sent to the non-Jews this message about how he saves people,
and they will listen \add and accept it\add*!” 
\p
\v 30 For two whole years Paul stayed \add there\add* in a house that he rented. Many people came to see him, and he received
them all gladly \add and talked with them\add*. 
\v 31 He preached \add and taught people\add* about how God could rule
\add their lives\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f* and taught them about the Lord Jesus Christ. He did that without being afraid, and no one tried to
stop him.
