\c 9  
\s Acts 9:1-2 
\s Saul asked the high priest to authorize him to arrest believers.
\p
\v 1 Meanwhile, Saul angrily continued to say, "I will kill those who believe that
\add Jesus is\add* the Lord!" He went to the high priest \add in
Jerusalem\add* 
\v 2 and requested him \add to write\add* letters \add introducing
him\add* to \add the leaders of\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* the Jewish meeting places in Damascus
\add city. The letters asked them to authorize Saul\add* to seize any men or women who followed the way
\add that Jesus had taught\add*, and to take them as prisoners to Jerusalem
\add so that the Jewish leaders could judge and punish them\add*.
\s Acts 9:3-8 
\s While Saul was traveling to Damascus, Jesus appeared to him and blinded him.
\p
\v 3 Saul took those letters, and while Saul \add and those with
him\add* were traveling, they were approaching Damascus. Suddenly a
\add brilliant\add* light from heaven shone around Saul. 
\v 4  \add Immediately\add* he fell down to the ground. Then he heard the voice
\add of the Lord\add* say to him, "Saul, Saul, stop causing me to suffer!\f + \ft Or: why are you causing me to suffer? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*"
\v 5 Saul asked him, "Lord, who are you?" He replied, "I am Jesus,
\add and\add* you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* are causing me to suffer \add by hurting my
followers!\add* 
\v 6 Now instead \add of continuing to do that\add*, stand up and go into the city!
\add Someone there\add* will tell you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* what I \add want\add* you to do."
\v 7 The men who were traveling with Saul \add became so frightened that
they\add* could not say anything. \add They just\add* stood there. They only heard the sound
\add when the Lord spoke\add*, but they did not see anyone. 
\v 8 Saul got up from the ground, but when he opened his eyes he could not see anything. So the men
\add with him\add* took him by the hand and led him into Damascus.
\v 9 For the next three days Saul could not see \add anything\add*, and he did not eat or drink anything.
\s Acts 9:9-19 
\s Saul could see again after Ananias had put his hands on him. 
\p
\v 10 In Damascus there was \add a Jew\add* named Ananias who believed in Jesus. While
\add Ananias was seeing\add* a vision, the Lord \add Jesus\add* said to him, "Ananias!" He replied, "Lord, I
\add am listening\add*." 
\v 11 The Lord Jesus told him, "Go to Straight Street to the house that belongs to Judas. Ask
\add someone there if you\f + \ft singular \f* can talk to\add* a man named Saul from
Tarsus\add city\add*, because, surprisingly, at this moment he is praying
\add to me\add*. 
\v 12  \add Saul has seen\add* a vision in which a man named Ananias entered
\add the house where he was staying\add* and put his hands on him in order that he might see again."
\v 13 But Ananias \add protested\add*, saying, "But Lord, many people have told me about this man! He has done many evil things
to the people in Jerusalem who \add believe in\add* you! 
\v 14 And the chief priests have authorized him to come here \add to
Damascus\add* in order to seize all us who believe in you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*
\add and take us to Jerusalem\add*!" 
\v 15 But the Lord \add Jesus\add* told Ananias, "Go to \add Saul! Do what I
say\add*, because I have chosen him to serve me in order that he might speak about me \f + \ft metonymy \f* both to non-Jewish people and
\add their\add* kings and to the Israelite people. 
\v 16 I myself will tell him that he must often suffer greatly because of
\add telling people about\add* me \f + \ft metonymy \f*." 
\v 17 So Ananias went, and \add after he found\add* the house \add where Saul
was\add*, he entered it. Then, \add as soon as he met Saul\add*, he put his hands on him, and he said, "Brother Saul, the Lord
Jesus \add himself\add* commanded me to come \add to you\add*. He is the
\add same\add* one who appeared to you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* while you were traveling along the road to here.
\add He sent me to you\add* in order that you might see again and that you might be completely controlled by the Holy Spirit
{that the Holy Spirit might completely control you}." 
\v 18 Instantly, things like \add fish\add* scales fell from Saul's eyes, and he was able to see again. Then he stood up and
was baptized {\add Ananias\add* baptized him} \add immediately\add*.
\v 19 After Saul ate some food, he became strong again. Saul stayed with the
\add other\add* believers in Damascus for several days. 
\s Acts 9:20-22 
\s People there were astonished that Saul had believed in Jesus.
\p
\v 20 Right away he began to preach \add to people about Jesus\add* in the Jewish meeting places
\add there. He told them\add* that Jesus is the Son of\f + \ft Or: the man who is also \f* God.
\v 21 And all the people who heard him \add preach\add* were amazed.
\add Various ones of\add* them were saying, "\add We\f + \ft inclusive \f* can hardly believe
that\add* this is the \add same man\add* who persecuted the believers in Jerusalem!\f + \ft Or: Is this really the
\add same man\add* who persecuted the believers in Jerusalem? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question, metonymy \f* And
we\add \f + \ft inclusive \f*\add* know that he has \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* come here to tie our hands and take us to the chief priests
\add in Jerusalem\add*!" 
\v 22 But \add God\add* enabled Saul \add to preach to many people
even\add* more convincingly. He was proving \add from the Scriptures\add* that Jesus is the Messiah. So the Jewish leaders in
Damascus could not think of anything to refute\add what he said\f + \ft Or: to prove that what he said was not
true\add* \f*. 
\s Acts 9:23-25 
\s Saul escaped from those who plotted to kill him. 
\p
\v 23 Some time later, \add after Saul had left Damascus and then
returned\add*, the Jewish \add leaders\add* \f + \ft synecdoche \f* \add there\add* plotted to kill him.
\v 24  \add During each\add* day and night those Jews were continually watching
\add the people passing through\add* the city gates, in order that
\add when they saw Saul\add* they might kill him. However, someone told Saul what they planned to do.
\v 25 So some of those whom he had helped \add to believe in Jesus\add* took him
\add one\add* night \add to the high stone wall that surrounded the
city\add*. They \add used ropes to\add* lower him in a \add large\add* basket through an opening in the wall.
\add So he escaped from Damascus\add*. 
\s Acts 9:26-28 
\s Barnabas introduced Saul to other believers in Jerusalem. 
\p
\v 26 When Saul arrived in Jerusalem, he began trying to associate with other believers. However,
\add almost\add* all of them continued to be afraid of him, because they did not believe that he had become a believer.
\v 27 But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles. He explained to the apostles how,
\add while Saul was traveling\add* along the road \add to Damascus\add*, he had seen the Lord
\add Jesus\add* and how the Lord had spoken to him \add there. He\add* also told them how Saul had preached boldly about Jesus
\f + \ft metonymy \f* \add to people\add* in Damascus. \add The apostles believed Barnabas and told the other believers about
that\add*. 
\v 28 So Saul began to associate with the apostles \add and other
believers\add* throughout Jerusalem, and he spoke boldly \add to
people\add* about \f + \ft metonymy \f* the Lord \add Jesus\add*. 
\s Acts 9:29-30 
\s The believers sent Saul to Tarsus because some Jews tried to kill him.
\p
\v 29 Saul was \add also\add* speaking \add about Jesus\add* with Jews who spoke Greek, and he was debating with them. But they
were continually trying \add to think\add* \add of a way\add* to kill him\f + \ft Or: of
\add how they could\add* kill him \f*. 
\v 30 When the \add other\add* believers heard that \add they were planning to kill him, some
of\add* the believers took Saul down to Caesarea \add city. There\add* they arranged for him to go
\add by ship\add* to Tarsus, \add his hometown\add*. 
\s Acts 9:31 
\s The church in Israel had peace and many people believed. 
\p
\v 31 So the groups of believers throughout \add the entire regions
of\add* Judea, Galilee, and Samaria lived peacefully \add because no one was persecuting them
anymore\add*. The Holy Spirit was strengthening them \add spiritually\add* and encouraging them. They were continuing to
reverence\f + \ft Or: honor \f* the Lord \add Jesus, and the Holy Spirit\add* was enabling many other people
\add to become believers\add*. 
\s Acts 9:32-35 
\s Because Peter healed Aeneas, many people believed in Jesus. 
\p
\v 32 While Peter was traveling throughout those \add regions, once\add* he went to
\add the coastal plain to visit\add* the believers \add who lived\add* in Lydda
\add town\add*. 
\v 33 There he met a man whose name was Aeneas. Aeneas had not been able to get up from
\add his\add* bed for eight years, because he was paralyzed. 
\v 34 Peter said to him, "Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you\add \f + \ft singular \f* right
now\add*! Get up and roll up your mat!" Right away Aeneas stood up.
\v 35 Most of the people who lived in Lydda and on Sharon \add Plain\add* saw Aeneas
\add after the Lord had healed him\add*, so they believed in the Lord
\add Jesus\add*. 
\s Acts 9:36-37 
\s Dorcas died. 
\p
\v 36 In Joppa \add town\add* there was a believer whose name was Tabitha.
\add Her name\add* in the \add Greek\add* language was Dorcas. \add Both of these names mean
gazelle\f + \ft Or: deer \f*\f + \ft Or: antelope \f*\add*. That woman was continually doing good deeds
\add for others. Specifically\add*, she was helping poor people \add by giving them things that they
needed\add*. 
\v 37 During the time \add that Peter was in Lydda\add*, she became sick and died.
\add Some women there\add* washed her body \add according to the Jewish custom so that the people could bury
it\add*. Then they \add covered her body with cloth and\add* placed it in an upstairs room
\add in her house\add*. 
\s Acts 9:38-43 
\s Peter resurrected Dorcas. 
\p
\v 38 Lydda was near Joppa, so when the disciples heard that Peter was
\add still\add* in Lydda, they sent two men to \add go\add* to Peter.
\add When they arrived where Peter was\add*, they repeatedly urged\f + \ft Or: begged \f* him, "Please come immediately with us
\add to Joppa\add*!" 
\v 39 So \add right away\add* Peter got ready and went with them. When they arrived
\add at the house in Joppa\add*, they took him to the upstairs room
\add where Dorcas' body was lying\add*. All the widows \add there\add* stood around him. They were crying and showing him the
cloaks and \add other\add* garments that Dorcas had made for people while she was still alive.
\v 40 But Peter sent them all out of the room. Then he got down on his knees and prayed. Then, turning toward her body, he
said, "Tabitha, stand up!" \add Immediately\add* she opened her eyes and, when she saw Peter, she sat up.
\v 41 He grasped one of her hands and helped her to stand up. After he had summoned the believers and
\add especially\add* the widows \add among them to come back in\add*, he showed them that she was alive
\add again\add*. 
\v 42  \add Soon\add* people everywhere in Joppa knew about that miracle, and as a result many people believed in the Lord
\add Jesus\add*. 
\v 43 Peter stayed in Joppa many days with a man named Simon who made leather
\add from animal skins\add*.
