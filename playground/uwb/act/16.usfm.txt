\s Acts 16:1-3 
\s Paul chose Timothy to work with him and Silas. 
\p
\v 1 Paul \add and Silas\add* went to Derbe \add city and visited the believers
there\add*. Next \add they went to\add* Lystra \add city\add*. A believer whose name was Timothy lived there. His mother was a
Jewish believer, but his father was a Greek. 
\v 2 The believers in Lystra and Iconium said good things about Timothy,
\v 3 and Paul wanted to take Timothy with him \add when he went\add* to other places, so he circumcised Timothy.
\add He did that so that\add* the Jews who lived in those places
\add would accept Timothy\add*, because they knew that his non-Jewish father
\add had not allowed him to be circumcised\add* {\add anyone to circumcise his
son\add*}. 
\s Acts 16:4-5 
\s Paul, Silas and Timothy told believers in Galatia what the church leaders had decided.
\p
\v 4  \add So Timothy went with Paul and Silas\add* and they traveled to many other towns.
\add In each town\add* they told \add the\add* believers the rules that had been decided by the apostles and elders in
Jerusalem {that the apostles and elders in Jerusalem had decided} that
\add non-Jewish\add* believers should obey. 
\p
\v 5  \add God was helping\add* the believers in those towns to trust more strongly
\add in the Lord Jesus\add*, and every day more people became believers.
\s Acts 16:6-10 
\s Because of a vision in Troas, Paul went to preach in Macedonia.
\p
\v 6 Paul and his companions wanted\f + \ft Or: planned \f* to enter Asia \add province\add* and preach the message
\add about Jesus\add* there, but they were prevented by the Holy Spirit {the Holy Spirit prevented them}
\add from going there. So\add* they traveled through Phrygia and Galatia
\add provinces\add*. 
\v 7 They arrived at the border of Mysia \add province\add* and they wanted to go
\add north\add* into Bithynia \add province\add*. But \add again\add* the Spirit of Jesus showed them that they should not
\add go there\add*. 
\v 8 So they went through Mysia \add province\add* and arrived at Troas, a
\add port city. I, Luke, joined them there\add*. 
\v 9 That night \add God gave\add* Paul a vision in which he saw a man
\add who was a native\add* of Macedonia \add province\add*. He was standing
\add some distance away\add*, and he was earnestly calling to Paul,
"\add Please\add* come over \add here\add* to Macedonia and help us!"
\v 10  \add The next morning\add* we\add (exc)\add* immediately got ready to go to Macedonia, because we believed that God had
called us to \add go and\add* preach the good message to the people there.
\s Acts 16:11-12 
\s Paul's company went from Troas to Philippi. 
\p
\v 11 So we\add (exc)\add* got on a ship in Troas and sailed across
\add the sea\add* to Samothrace \add Island. We spent the night there\add*, and the next day
\add we sailed again across the sea and arrived\add* at Neapolis
\add port\f + \ft Or: town \f*\add*. 
\v 12 Then we \add left Neapolis and\add* went \add by land\add* to Philippi. It was a very important city in Macedonia
\add province, where many\add* Roman citizens lived. We stayed in Philippi several days.
\s Acts 16:13-15 
\s Paul preached the gospel and Lydia became a believer. 
\p
\v 13 On the first Sabbath\f + \ft Or: Jewish day of rest \f* \add after we(exc)
arrived\add*, we went outside the city gate \add down\add* to the river. We had heard
\add someone say\add* that \add Jewish\add* people gathered to pray there.
\add When we arrived there, we saw\add* some women who had gathered
\add to pray\add*. So we sat down and began to tell them \add the message about
Jesus\add*. 
\v 14 A woman whose name was Lydia was one of those who were listening
\add to Paul. She was a non-Jewish woman\add*, from Thyatira \add city, who bought
and\add* sold \add expensive\add* purple cloth. She had accepted what the Jews believe about God. The Lord
\add God\add* caused her to pay attention to the message that Paul preached, and she believed it.
\add The members of her household also heard the good message and believed in
Jesus\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*. 
\v 15 After \add Paul and Silas\add* baptized Lydia and the others who lived in her house \f + \ft metonymy \f* {After Lydia and the others who
lived in her house were baptized}, she invited us to \add go and stay
in\add* her home. She said, "You\add (pl)\add* know that I \add now\add* believe in the Lord
\add Jesus\add*, so \add please\add* come and stay in my house." She persuaded us
\add to do that, so we(exc) stayed there\add*. 
\s Acts 16:16-24 
\s Paul expelled a demon from a slave girl, so officials imprisoned Paul and Silas.
\p
\v 16 Another day, while we\add (exc)\add* were going to the place where people regularly gathered to pray, we met a young
woman who was a slave. An evil spirit was enabling her to be a ventriloquist and to tell people what would happen
\add to them\add*. People paid a lot of money to \add the men who
were\add* her owners, in return for her telling them things that
\add she said\add* would happen \add to them\add*. 
\v 17 This young woman followed Paul and the rest of us. She continually shouted, "These men serve the God who is the greatest
\add of all gods\add*! They are telling you how \add God\add* can save you
\add so that he will not punish you\f + \ft Or: to be\add* saved \f*" 
\v 18 She continued to do that for many days. Finally Paul became irritated. So he turned
\add toward the young woman\add* and rebuked the evil spirit \add that was in her. He
said\add*, "By the authority \f + \ft metonymy \f* of Jesus Christ, I command you\add (sg)\add* to come out of this young woman!" Right away
the evil spirit left her. 
\v 19 And then her owners realized that she could no longer earn money for them
\add because she could no longer predict what would happen to people, so they were
angry\add*. They grabbed Paul and Silas and forcefully took them to the public square, to
\add the place where\add* the government authorities and \add a lot of other people were
gathered\add*. 
\v 20 The owners \add of the young woman\add* brought them to the city officials and told them, "These men are Jews, and they
are greatly troubling \add the people in\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* our city. 
\v 21 They are teaching that we\add (inc)\add* should follow customs that our laws do not allow us Romans to consider
\add to be correct\add* or to obey!" 
\v 22 Many of the crowd joined \add those who were accusing\add* Paul and Silas, and started beating them. Then the
\add Roman\add* authorities commanded \add soldiers\add* to tear the shirts off Paul and Silas and to beat them
\add with rods\f + \ft Or: sticks \f*\add*. 
\v 23  \add So the soldiers\add* beat Paul and Silas vigorously \add with
rods\add*. After that, they \add took them and\add* shoved them into the prison. They told the jailer that he should lock them
up securely. 
\v 24  \add Because the officials\add* had \add commanded\add* him
\add to do that\add*, the jailer shoved Paul and Silas into the cell that was farthest inside.
\add There, he made them sit down on the floor\f + \ft Or: ground \f* and stretch out their
legs\add*. Then he fastened their ankles in \add grooves\add* between two large wooden beams,
\add so that Paul and Silas could not move their legs\add*. 
\s Acts 16:25-34 
\s Paul and Silas helped the jailer and his household to become believers.
\p
\v 25 About midnight, Paul and Silas were praying \add aloud\add* and praising God by singing hymns. The
\add other\add* prisoners were listening attentively to them. 
\v 26 Suddenly there was a very strong earthquake. It shook the entire jail \f + \ft synecdoche \f* and its foundation \f + \ft synecdoche \f*.
\add The earthquake caused\add* all the doors \add of the jail\add* to open suddenly, and
\add caused\add* all the chains that fastened the prisoners to fall off.
\v 27 The jailer woke up and saw that the doors of the jail were open. He thought that the prisoners had escaped. So he pulled
out his sword in order to kill himself, \add because he knew that the officials would kill him if the prisoners
escaped\add*. 
\v 28 Paul \add saw the jailer and\add* shouted to him, "Do not harm yourself!
We\add (exc) prisoners\add* are all here!" 
\v 29 The jailer shouted \add to someone\add* to bring torches\f + \ft Or: lanterns \f*,
\add and after they brought them\add*, he rushed into the jail and knelt down in front of Paul and Silas.
\add He was very much afraid, so\add* much so that he was trembling\f + \ft Or: shaking \f*.
\v 30 Then he brought Paul and Silas out \add of the jail\add* and asked: "Sirs, what do I need to do to be saved
\add from being punished for my sins\add*?" 
\v 31  \add They answered\add*, "Trust in \add what\add* the Lord Jesus
\add has done for you\add*, and you will be saved {\add God\add* will save you}, and the others who live in \f + \ft metonymy \f* your house
will \add also\add* be saved \add if they believe in Jesus\add*."
\p
\v 32-34 Then the jailer took Paul and Silas into his house, washed their wounds, and gave them a meal.
\add He woke up all the people in his house and\add* Paul and Silas told all of them the message about the Lord
\add Jesus. They all believed in him\add*. Immediately \add after that, the jailer and all his family were
baptized\add* {\add Paul and Silas\add* baptized the jailer and all his family}. They were very happy, because now they all
believed in God. 
\s Acts 16:35-40 
\s Paul and Silas encouraged the believers and then left Philippi.
\p
\v 35 The next morning, the \add Roman\add* officials commanded \add some\add* police officers
\add to go to the jail to say to the jailer\add*, "\add Our bosses\add* say, 'Let those
\add two\add* prisoners go \add now\add*!'" 
\v 36  \add After the officers went and told that to\add* the jailer, he
\add went and\add* told Paul, "The \add Roman\add* authorities have sent a
message\add (sg)\add* saying that I should release you\add (sg)\add* and Silas
\add from prison\add*. So you \add two\add* can leave \add the jail\add* now. Now you can go peacefully!"
\v 37 But Paul said to the police officers, "The authorities \add commanded men
to\add* beat us in front of a crowd before \add those authorities\add* had learned if
we\add (exc)\add* had done anything wrong! Then they \add ordered men
to\add* shove us into jail! \add But that was not legal, because\add*
we\add (exc)\add* are Roman citizens! And now they want \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* to send us away secretly! We will not accept that! Those
\add Roman\add* officials must come themselves and\add tell us that they are
sorry\add*, and take us out \add of jail\add*." 
\v 38 So the police officers \add went and\add* told the city authorities
\add what Paul had said\add*. When those authorities heard that Paul and Silas were Roman citizens, they were afraid
\add that someone would report to more important officials what they had done, and as a result they would be
punished\add* {\add those officials would punish them\add*}. 
\v 39 So the city authorities came to Paul and Silas and told them that they were sorry for what they had done to them. The
authorities brought them out of the jail, and repeatedly asked them to leave the city
\add soon\add*. 
\v 40 After Paul and Silas left the jail, they went to Lydia's house. There they met with her and the
\add other\add* believers. They encouraged the believers \add to continue trusting in the Lord
Jesus\add*, and then the two apostles left \add Philippi\add*.
