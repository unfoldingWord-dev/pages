\s Acts 7:1-4 
\s Stephen started to answer the high priest's accusations by talking about Abraham.
\p
\v 1 Then the high priest asked Stephen, “Are the things that \add these people are saying about
you(sg)\add* true?” 
\v 2 Stephen replied, “Fellow Jews and respected leaders, \add please\add* listen to me! The glorious God
\add whom we(inc) worship\add* appeared to our ancestor Abraham while he was still
\add living\add* in Mesopotamia \add region\add*, before he moved to Haran
\add town\add*. 
\v 3 God said to him, ‘Leave this land where you\add (sg)\add* and your relatives
\add are living\add*, and go into the land to which I will lead you.’
\v 4 So Abraham left that land, \add which was also called\add* Chaldea, and he arrived in Haran
\add town\add* and lived there. After his father died, God told him to move to this land in which you
\add and I\add* are now living.” 
\s Acts 7:5 
\s God promised to give the land to Abraham and his descendants.
\p
\v 5 “\add At that time\add* God did not give Abraham any \add land
here\add*, not even a small plot of \add this\add* land that would belong to him. God promised that he would
\add later\add* give this land to him and his descendants, and that it would
\add always\add* belong \add to them. However\add*, at that time Abraham did not have any children
\add who would\add* ◄\add inherit it\f + \ft Or: receive \f* it after he died\add*►.”
\s Acts 7:6-7 
\s God told Abraham that later on he would deliver his descendants from Egypt.
\p
\v 6 “\add Later\add* God told Abraham, ‘Your descendants will go and live in a foreign country. They
\add will live there\add* for four hundred years, and \add during that time their
leaders\add* will mistreat your descendants and force them to work as slaves.’
\v 7 But God \add also\add* said, ‘I will punish the people who make them work as slaves. Then, after that, your descendants
will leave \add that land\add* and they will \add come and\add* worship me in this land.’ ”
\s Acts 7:8 
\s God commanded the ceremony of circumcision for Abraham and his descendants.
\p
\v 8 “Then God commanded Abraham that \add every male in his household and all of his male
descendants\add* should be circumcised \add to show that they all belonged to
God\add* and that they would obey what he had told Abraham to do. Later Abraham's son, Isaac, was born, and when Isaac was
eight days old, Abraham circumcised him. \add Later\add* Isaac's son, Jacob, was born, and Isaac
\add similarly circumcised\add* him. And Jacob \add similarly circumcised\add* his twelve sons. They are the twelve men
\add from whom we(inc) Jews have all descended\add*.” 
\s Acts 7:9-10 
\s God helped Joseph, so Pharaoh appointed him to govern Egypt. 
\p
\v 9 “\add You know that\add* Jacob's \add older\add* sons became jealous
\add because their father favored their younger brother\add* Joseph. So they sold him
\add to merchants\f + \ft Or: traders \f* who took him\add* \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* to Egypt. There he became a slave
\add of an official who lived there\add*. But God \add helped\add* Joseph.
\v 10 He protected him whenever people caused him to suffer. He enabled Joseph to be wise; and he caused Pharaoh, the king of
Egypt, to think well of Joseph. So Pharaoh appointed him to rule
\add over\add* Egypt and to look after all of Pharaoh's property \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f*.”
\s Acts 7:11-15a 
\s There was a famine in Canaan, so Jacob's family moved to Egypt.
\p
\v 11 “\add While Joseph was doing that work\add*, there was a time ◄when there was very little food\f + \ft Or: of \f* famine► throughout
Egypt and also throughout Canaan. People did not have enough food to eat. People were suffering.
\add At that time\add* Jacob and his sons \add in Canaan\add* also could not find
\add enough\add* food. 
\v 12 When Jacob heard\add people report that\add* there was grain\f + \ft Or: food \f*
\add that people could buy\add* in Egypt, he sent Joseph's older brothers
\add to go there to buy grain. They went and bought grain from Joseph, but they did not recognize him. Then they returned
home\add*. 
\v 13 When Joseph's brothers went to Egypt the second time, \add they again bought grain from
Joseph\add*. But this time \add he\add* told them who he was. \add And\add* people told Pharaoh that Joseph's people were
Hebrews \add and that those men who had come from Canaan were his
brothers\add*. 
\v 14 Then after Joseph sent \add his brothers back home, they\add* told their father Jacob
\add that Joseph wanted\add* him and his entire family to come \add to Egypt. At that
time\add* ◄\add Jacob's family consisted of\add* seventy-five people\f + \ft Or: there \f* were seventy-five people in Jacob's family► \\f + \\ft synecdoche \\f*.
\v 15  \add So when\add* Jacob \add heard that, he and all his family\add* went to
\add live in\add* Egypt.” 
\s Acts 7:15b-16 
\s When Jacob and his sons died, people buried them in Canaan. 
\p “\add Later on\add*, Jacob died \add there\add*, and our \add other\add* ancestors,
\add his sons, also died there\add*. 
\v 16  \add But\add* the bodies \add of Jacob and Joseph\add* were brought
{\add they\add* brought the bodies \add of Jacob and Joseph\add*}
\add back to our land\add*, and \add Jacob's body\add* was buried {they buried
\add Jacob's body\add*} \add in the tomb that Abraham had bought, and they buried Joseph's
body\add* in Shechem in the ground that \add Jacob\add* had bought from Hamor's sons.”
\s Acts 7:17-19 
\s An Egyptian king who did not know about Joseph began to oppress the Israelites.
\p
\v 17 “Our ancestors had become very numerous when it was almost time for
\add God to rescue them\add* from Egypt, \add as\add* he had promised Abraham that he would do.
\v 18 Another king had begun to rule in Egypt. He did not know that Joseph,
\add long before that time, had greatly helped the people of Egypt\add* \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f*.
\v 19 That king cruelly tried to get rid of our ancestors. He oppressed them and caused them to suffer greatly. He
\add even commanded\add* them to leave their baby \add boys\add* outside
\add their homes\add* so that they would die.” 
\s Acts 7:20-22 
\s Moses, who grew up as an Egyptian, spoke and acted powerfully.
\p
\v 20 “During that time Moses was born, and he was a very beautiful \\f + \\ft litotes \\f*
\add child\add*. So his parents \add secretly\add* cared for him in their house for three months.
\v 21 Then they had to put him outside \add the house, but\add* Pharaoh's daughter
\add found him and\add* adopted him and cared for him as \add though he
were\add* her own son. 
\v 22 Moses was taught {\add The Egyptian teachers\add* taught Moses} many kinds of wise things \\f + \\ft hyperbole \\f* that the people in Egypt
knew, and \add when he grew up\add*, he spoke powerfully and did things powerfully.”
\s Acts 7:23-29 
\s Moses killed an Egyptian, so he had to flee to Midian. 
\p
\v 23 “\add One day\add* when Moses was about forty years old, he decided that he would
\add go and\add* see his fellow Israelites. \add So he went to the place where they
worked\add*. 
\v 24 He saw an Egyptian beating one of the Israelites. So he went over to help \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* the Israelite man who was being hurt\f + \ft Or: beat \f*
{whom \add the Egyptian\add* was hurting\f + \ft Or: beating \f*}, and he ◄got revenge on\f + \ft Or: paid \f* back► the Israelite man by killing the Egyptian
\add who was hurting\f + \ft Or: beating \f* him\add*. 
\v 25 Moses was thinking that his fellow Israelites would understand that God had sent him to free them
\add from being slaves\add*. But they did not understand that. 
\v 26 The next day, Moses saw two Israelite men fighting \add each
other\add*. He tried to make them stop fighting by saying to them, ‘Men, you two are fellow
\add Israelites! So\add* ◄stop hurting each other!\f + \ft Or: why \f* are you hurting each other?► \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f*’
\v 27 But the man who was injuring the other man pushed Moses away and said to him, ‘◄No one appointed
you\add (sg)\add* to rule and judge us\add (exc)\add*!\f + \ft Or: Do \f* you\add (sg)\add* think someone appointed
you\add (sg)\add* to rule and judge us\add (exc)\add*?► \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* 
\v 28 Do you want to kill me as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?’
\v 29 When Moses heard that, \add he thought to himself, ‘Obviously, people know what I have done, and someone will kill me.’
He was afraid, so\add* he fled \add from Egypt\add* to Midian land. He lived there
\add for some years\add*. He \add got married, and he and his wife\add* had two sons.”
\s Acts 7:30-34 
\s God commanded Moses to rescue the Jewish people from Egypt. 
\p
\v 30 “\add One day\add* forty years later, \add the Lord God appeared
as\add* an angel to Moses. He appeared in a bush that was burning in the desert near Sinai Mountain.
\v 31 When Moses saw that, he was greatly surprised, \add because the bush was not burning
up\add*. As he went over to look more closely, he heard the Lord
\add God\add* say \add to him\add*, 
\v 32 ‘I \add am\add* the God \add whom\add* your ancestors \add worshipped\add*. I
\add am\add* the God that Abraham, Isaac and Jacob \add worship\add*.’ Moses
\add was so afraid that he\add* began to shake. He was afraid to look
\add at the bush any longer\add*. 
\v 33 Then the Lord \add God\add* said to him, ‘Take your sandals off
\add to show that you(sg) reverence me\add*. Because I \add am here\add*, the place where you are standing is holy\f + \ft Or: sacred \f*.
\v 34 I have surely seen how the people of Egypt are continually causing my people to suffer. I have heard my people when they
groan \add because those people continually oppress them\add*. So I have come down to rescue them
\add from Egypt\add*. Now get ready, because I am going to send you
\add back\add* to Egypt \add to do that\add*.’” 
\s Acts 7:35-38 
\s God sent Moses to lead Israel and tell them of the Prophet who would come.
\p
\v 35 “This Moses \add is the one who had tried to help our Israelite people,
but\add* whom they rejected \add by saying\add*, ‘No one \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* appointed you to rule and judge
\add us!’\add* Moses \add is the one whom\add* God \add himself\add* sent to rule them and to free them
\add from being slaves. He is the one whom\add* an angel in the bush
\add commanded to do that\add*. 
\v 36 Moses \add is the one who\add* led our ancestors out \add from
Egypt\add*. He did many kinds of miracles in Egypt, at the Red Sea, and during the forty years
\add that the Israelite people lived\add* in the desert. 
\v 37 This Moses is the one who said to the Israelite people, ‘God will appoint a prophet for you from among your own people.
\add He will speak words from God\add*, just like I \add speak his words to
you\add*.’ 
\v 38 This man \add Moses\add* was \add our people's leader\add* when they gathered together in the desert. It is Moses to whom
\add God sent\add* the angel on Mount Sinai to \add give him our
laws\add*, and \add he was the one who told\add* our \add other\add* ancestors
\add what the angel had said\add*. He was the one who received \add from
God\add* words that tell us how to live \add eternally, and Moses\add* passed
\add them\add* on to us.” 
\s Acts 7:39-43 
\s Israel rejected Moses, so God rejected them and said that he would punish them.
\p
\v 39 “\add However\add*, our ancestors did not want to obey \add Moses\add*. Instead,
\add while he was still on the mountain\add*, they rejected him \add as their
leader\add* and decided that they wanted to return to Egypt. 
\v 40 So they told \add his older brother\add* Aaron, ‘Make idols for us who will be our gods to lead us
\add back to Egypt\add*! As for that fellow Moses who led us out of Egypt
we\add (exc)\add* do not know what has happened to him!’ 
\v 41 So, they made an image \add out of gold that looked like\add* a calf. Then they sacrificed
\add animals and offered other things\add* to \add honor\add* that idol, and they sang and danced to honor the idol that they
themselves had made. 
\v 42 So God rejected them. He abandoned them to worship the sun, moon and stars in the sky. This agrees with the words that
one of the prophets wrote that God said, 
\q You Israelite \add people\add* \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f*, when you \add repeatedly\add* killed animals and offered them as sacrifices during
those forty years \add that you were\add* in the desert, ◄you \add most
certainly\add* were not offering them to me!\f + \ft Or: what \f* makes you think that you were offering them to me?► \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f*
\v 43  \add On the contrary\add*, you carried \add with you from place to
place\add* the tent \add that contained the idol\add* representing
\add the god\add* Molech \add that you worshipped\add*. You also
\add carried with you\add* the image of the star \add called\add* Rephan.
\add Those\add* were idols that you had made, \add and you\add* worshipped\add them instead of
me\add*. So I will \add cause you to\add* be taken away {\add people
to\add* take you} \add from your own country. You will be taken\add*
{\add They will take you\add*} \add far from your homes to regions\add* even farther than Babylon
\add country\add*.” 
\s Acts 7:44-47 
\s The Israelite people worshipped God at the tent Moses built and later in the temple that Solomon built.
\p
\v 44 “While our ancestors were in the desert, they worshipped God at the tent that
showed\add that he was there with them\add*. They had made the tent exactly like God had commanded Moses
\add to make it. It was\add* exactly like the model that Moses had seen
\add when he was up on the mountain\add*. 
\v 45  \add Later on\add*, other ancestors of ours carried that tent with them when Joshua led them
\add into this land\add*. That was during the time that they took this land for themselves, when God forced the people
\add who previously lived here\add* to leave. So the Israelites were able to possess this land.
\add The tent remained in this land and was still here\add* when
\add King\add* David ruled. 
\v 46 David pleased God, and he asked God to let him build a house where
\add he and\add* all of our Israelite people could worship God. 
\v 47 But \add instead, God let David's son\add* Solomon build a house
\add where people could worship\add* God.” 
\s Acts 7:48-50 
\s People can worship God anywhere, not only at certain places. 
\p
\v 48 “However, \add we(inc) know that\add* God is greater than everything, and he does not live in
\add houses that\add* people \\f + \\ft synecdoche \\f* have made. It is like the prophet
\add Isaiah\add* wrote. He wrote \add these words that God had spoken:\add*
\q
\v 49-50 Heaven is ◄my throne\f + \ft Or: the \f* place from which I rule the entire universe►, and the earth is ◄my
footstool\f + \ft Or:  \f*\add merely like\add* a stool on which I may rest my feet►. I myself \\f + \\ft synecdoche \\f* have made everything
\add both in heaven and on the earth\add*. So you \add human beings\add*,
◄\add you\add* really cannot build a house that would be \add adequate\add* for me!\f + \ft Or: do \f* you think you can build a house that
would be \add appropriate\add* for me?► \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* You cannot \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* make a place good enough for me
\add to live in!\add*” 
\s Acts 7:51-53 
\s Stephen said that those who were listening to him were opposing God.
\p
\v 51 “You people are extremely stubborn \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f*, not wanting to obey God or listen \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f*
\add to him!\add* You are exactly like your ancestors! You always resist the Holy Spirit
\add as they did\add*! 
\v 52 Your ancestors caused \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* every prophet to suffer, \add including
Moses\add*. They even killed those who long ago announced \add that the
Messiah\add* would come, the one who always did what pleased God.
\add And the Messiah has come! He is the one whom\add* you \add recently\add* turned over
\add to his enemies\add* and \add insisted that\add* they kill him!
\v 53 You \add are the people\add* who have received God's laws.
\add Those were laws\add* that God caused angels to give \add to our
ancestors\add*. However, \add incredibly\add*, you have not obeyed them!”
\s Acts 7:54 
\s All the people there became very angry with Stephen. 
\p
\v 54 When the Jewish Council members \add and others there\add* heard all that
\add Stephen said\add*, they became very angry. They were grinding their teeth
\add together because they were so angry\add* at him! 
\s Acts 7:55-59 
\s After Stephen said that he could see Jesus standing beside God in heaven, they stoned him.
\p
\v 55 But the Holy Spirit completely controlled Stephen. He looked up into heaven and saw a dazzling light from God, and
\add he saw\add* Jesus standing at God's right side. 
\v 56 “Look,” he said, “I see heaven open, and I \add see\add* the one who came from heaven standing at God's right side!”
\p
\v 57  \add When the Jewish Council members and others heard that\add*, they shouted loudly. They put their hands over their
ears \add so that they could not hear him, and immediately\add* they all rushed at him.
\v 58 They dragged him outside the city \add of Jerusalem\add* and started to throw stones at him. The people who were accusing
him \add took off\add* their outer garments \add in order to throw stones more easily,
and\add* they put their clothes \add on the ground\add* next to a young man whose name was Saul,
\add so that he could guard them\add*. 
\v 59 While they continued to throw stones at Stephen, Stephen prayed, “Lord Jesus, receive my spirit!”
\s Acts 7:60-8:3 
\s He asked the Lord to forgive them and he died. The disciples fled, some men buried Stephen, and Saul harassed believers. But
the believers preached about Jesus wherever they were scattered.
\p
\v 60 Then Stephen fell on his knees and cried out, “Lord, do not punish them \f + \ft (OR, forgive them) \f* \\f + \\ft litotes \\f* for this sin!” After he
had said that, he died.
