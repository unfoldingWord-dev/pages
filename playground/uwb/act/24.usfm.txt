\c 24  
\s Acts 24:1-9 
\s Paul defended himself, and Felix promised to judge him. 
\p
\v 1 Five days later Ananias the high priest, \add having heard that Paul was now in
Caesarea\add*, went down \add there from Jerusalem\add*, along with some
\add other Jewish\add* elders and a lawyer \add whose name was\add* Tertullus. There they formally told the governor what Paul
had done \add that they considered\add* wrong. 
\v 2  \add The governor commanded\add* Paul to be brought {\add a
soldier\add* to bring Paul} in. \add When Paul arrived\add*, Tertullus began to accuse him. He said
\add to the governor\add*, “Honorable Governor Felix, during the many years that
you\add (sg)\add* have ruled us, we\add (exc)\add* have lived well\f + \ft Or: peacefully \f*. By planning wisely, you have improved many
things in this province. 
\v 3  \add Therefore\add*, sir, we\add (exc)\add* always gratefully acknowledge everything that
\add you have done\add* for all \add of us\add*, wherever \add you have done those
things\add*. 
\v 4 But, so that I will not take up too much of your time, I earnestly request that you kindly listen to me very briefly.
\v 5 We\add (exc)\add* have observed that this man, \add wherever he
goes\add*, causes trouble. \add Specifically\add*, he causes all the Jews everywhere \f + \ft hyperbole \f* to riot.
\add Also\add*, he leads the entire group \add whom people call\add* ‘the followers of the Nazarene’, a
\add false\add* sect. 
\v 6 He even tried to do things in the Temple \add in Jerusalem\add* that would defile it\f + \ft Or: make it unholy \f*. So we
\add (exc)\add* seized him.\f +  \fqa Jewish law.”\f* 
\v 7 But Lysias, the commander at the Roman fort, came with his soldiers and forcefully took him away from us \f + \ft synecdoche \f*.
\v 8 Lysias also commanded Paul's accusers to come here and accuse Paul before you. If you question him yourself, you will be
able to learn that all these things about which we are accusing him are true.”
\v 9 When the Jewish \add leaders who were listening heard that,
they\add* told \add the governor that\add* what Tertullus had said was true.
\s Acts 24:10-21 
\s Paul disproved what they had said, but admitted that he was a Christian.
\p
\v 10 Then the governor motioned with \add his hand to Paul that\add* he should speak. So Paul replied. He said,
“\add Governor Felix, I know that you(sg) have judged this Jewish\add* province for many years. Therefore I gladly defend
myself, confident \add that you will listen to me and will judge me
fairly\add*. 
\v 11 You\add (sg)\add* can \add easily\add* ascertain that it has not been more than twelve days since\f + \ft Or: only twelve days ago \f*
I went up went up to Jerusalem to worship \add God. That is not enough time to cause a lot of
trouble\add*. 
\v 12 No one \add can claim legitimately that they\add* saw me arguing with anyone at the Temple courts
\add because I did not do that. No one can claim legitimately that they saw
me\add* causing people to riot in \add any Jewish meeting place\add*, or causing trouble anywhere
\add else\add* in \add Jerusalem city, because I did not do that\add*.
\v 13 So they cannot prove to you the things about which they are now accusing me.
\v 14 But I admit to you\add (sg) that this is true\add*: I do worship the God that our ancestors
\add worshipped. It is true that\add* I follow the way that \add Jesus taught
us\add*. The Jewish leaders call that a false religion\f + \ft Or: teaching \f*. I also believe everything that was written
\add by Moses\add* {that \add Moses wrote\add*} in the laws that
\add God gave him\add* and everything that was written by the \add other\add* prophets {that the
\add other\add* prophets wrote} \add in their books\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*. 
\v 15 I confidently expect, just like \add some of\add* these men also expect, that
\add some day God\add* will cause everyone who has died to become alive again. He will ◄cause to become alive again\f + \ft Or: raise \f* from
the dead► both those who were righteous and those who were wicked.
\v 16  \add Because I am confidently waiting for that day\add*, I always try to do what pleases God and what other people think
is right. 
\v 17 After I \add had been in other places for\add* several years, I returned to Jerusalem. I went there to deliver some money
to my fellow Jews \add who are\add* poor, and to offer sacrifices
\add to God\add*. 
\v 18 Some \add Jews\add* saw me in the temple \add courts\add* after I had completed the ritual by which a person is made
{that makes a person} pure. There was no crowd with me, and I was not causing
\add people\add* to riot. 
\v 19 But it was some \add other\add* Jews \add who had come\add* from Asia
\add province who really caused people to riot. They\add* should be here in front of
you\add (sg)\add* to accuse me, if they thought that I \add did\add*
something\add wrong\add*. 
\v 20  \add But if they\add* do not \add want to do that\add* \f + \ft Or:
\add But because they\add* are \add not\add* here \f*, these \add Jewish\add* men who are here should tell
you\add (sg)\add* what \add they think\add* I did that was wrong, when I
\add defended myself\add* before their Council. 
\v 21  \add They might say that\add* one thing that I shouted as I stood before them
\add was wrong. What I said\add* was, ‘You are judging me today because I believe that
\add God\add* will ◄cause \add all people\add* who have died to become alive again\f + \ft Or: raise \f*
\add all people\add* from the dead►.’” 
\s Acts 24:22-23 
\s Governor Felix adjourned the trial. 
\p
\v 22 Felix already knew quite a lot about \add what people called\add* 'the way
\add of Jesus'\add*. But he did not let Paul or his accusers continue to speak.
\add Instead\add*, he said \add to them\add*, “\add Later\add*, when Commander Lysias comes down here, I will decide these
matters that concern you all.” 
\v 23 Then he told the officer \add who was guarding Paul\add* to
\add take Paul back to the prison and\add* make sure that Paul was guarded all the time. But he said that Paul was not to be
chained {that the officer was not to fasten chains on him}, and if his friends came to visit him,
\add the officer\add* should allow them to help Paul \add in any way that they
wished\add*. 
\s Acts 24:24-27 
\s Felix often talked to Paul, hoping that Paul would give him money.
\p
\v 24 Several days later Felix and his wife Drusilla, who was a Jew, came
\add back to Caesarea after having been away for a few days\add*. Felix
\add commanded\add* Paul to be brought in {\add a soldier to\add* bring Paul in}. Then Felix listened to what Paul
\add said to him\add*. Paul spoke about what \add Christians\add* believe about the Messiah Jesus.
\v 25 Paul explained \add to them about what God requires people\add* to do in order to please him.
\add He also explained about God requiring people to\add* control how they
act\add . Paul also told him that there will be a time when God\add* will judge
\add people\add*. Felix became alarmed \add after hearing those things.
So\add* he said to Paul, “That is all I \add want to hear\add* now. When there is a time that is convenient I will ask
you\add (sg)\add* to come \add to me again\add*.” 
\v 26  \add Felix said that because\add* he hoped that Paul would give him some money for
\add allowing Paul to get out of prison\add*. So he repeatedly sent for Paul to come, and Paul
\add repeatedly went and\add* talked with him. \add But he\add* did
not\add give Felix any money, and Felix did not command his soldiers to release Paul from
prison\add*. 
\p
\v 27 Felix let Paul remain in prison, because he wanted to please the Jewish
\add leaders and he knew that they did not want him to release Paul\add*. But when two years had passed, Porcius Festus became
governor in place of Felix.
