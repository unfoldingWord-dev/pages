\s Solomon's many wives 
\p
\v 1 King Solomon married many foreign women. First he married the daughter of the king of Egypt. He also married women from
the Heth people-group and from the Moab, Ammon, and Edom people-groups, and from Sidon
\add city\add*. 
\v 2 He married them even though Yahweh had commanded the Israeli people saying, "Do not marry people from those areas, because
if you do that, they will surely persuade you [IDI] to worship the gods that they worship!"
\v 3 Solomon married 700 women who were kings' daughters. He also had 300 wives who were his slaves\f + \ft Or: servants \f*. And his wives
caused him to turn away \add from worshiping God\add*. 
\v 4 By the time that Solomon became old, they had persuaded him to worship the gods from their countries. He was not
completely dedicated\f + \ft Or: committed \f* to Yahweh his God like his father \f + \ft synecdoche \f* David had been.
\v 5 Solomon worshiped Astarte, the goddess that the people of Sidon
\add worshiped\add*, and he worshiped Molech, the disgusting god that the Ammon people-group
\add worshiped\add*. 
\v 6 Thus Solomon did things that Yahweh said were evil. He did not conduct his life like his father David had done; he did not
conduct his life as Yahweh wanted him to. 
\p
\v 7 On the hill to the east of Jerusalem he built a place to worship Chemosh, the disgusting god that the Moab people-group
\add worshiped\add*, and a place to worship Molech, the disgusting god that the Ammon people-group
\add worshiped\add*. 
\v 8 He also built places where all his foreign wives could burn incense and offer sacrifices to the gods from their own
countries. 
\p
\v 9-10 Even though Yahweh, the God whom the Israelis \add worshiped\add*, had appeared to Solomon two times, and had commanded
him to not worship foreign gods, Solomon refused to obey Yahweh. So Yahweh was angry with Solomon,
\v 11 and said to him, "You have chosen to disobey the agreement that I made with you and to disobey what I commanded you. So I
am surely not going to allow you to rule all of your kingdom. I am going to allow one of your officials to rule it.
\v 12 But, because of what \add I promised\add* your father David, I will allow you to rule all your kingdom while you are
still \add living\add*. \add After you die\add*, I will not allow your son to rule the whole kingdom \f + \ft metonymy \f*.
\v 13 But I will not take all the kingdom away from him. Instead, I will allow him to rule one tribe, because of what I
promised to David, who served me \add well\add*, and because \add I want David's descendants to rule
in\add* Jerusalem, \add where my temple is located\add*." 
\s Solomon's enemies 
\p
\v 14 Yahweh caused Hadad, from the family of the kings in the Edom people-group, to rebel against Solomon.
\v 15-16 What happened was that previously, when David's \add army\add* had conquered the Edom people-group, his army commander
Joab had gone there to \add help\add* bury the \add Israeli soldiers\add* who had been killed
\add in the battle\add*. Joab and his army remained in the Edom area for six months, and during that time they killed all the
males of that area. 
\v 17 Hadad was a young child \add at that time\add*, and he had escaped to Egypt, along with some of his father's servants
from the Edom area. 
\v 18 They \add went to\add* the Midian \add region\add*, and then they went to
\add the desert area at\add* Paran. Some other men joined them there. Then they all traveled to Egypt and went to see the king
of Egypt. The king gave Hadad some land and ordered his servants to give him some food regularly.
\v 19 The king liked Hadad. As a result he gave him the sister of his own wife, Queen Tahpenes, to be Hadad's wife.
\p
\v 20 Later Hadad's wife gave birth to a son named Genubath. The sister of Tahpenes raised him\f + \ft Or: brought him up \f* in the palace,
where he lived with the king's sons. 
\b
\p
\v 21 While Hadad was in Egypt, he heard that David had died \f + \ft euphemism \f*, and that Joab, the commander of David's army, was also
dead. So he said to the king of Egypt, "Please allow me to return to my own country."
\p
\v 22 But the king said to him, "Why do you want to go back to your country? Is there something that you lack that you want me
to give to you?" Hadad replied, "No, but please just allow me to go."
\add So the king allowed him to leave, and he returned to his own country and became the king of
Edom\add*. 
\p
\v 23 God also caused another man named Rezon, the son of Eliada, to rebel against Solomon. Rezon had run away from his master,
King Hadadezer of the Zobah \add area north of Damascus\add*. 
\v 24 Rezon then became the leader of a group of outlaws. That happened after David's
\add army had defeated Hadadezer\add* and had also killed all \add his
soldiers\add*. Rezon and his men went to Damascus and started to live there, and
\add the people there\add* appointed him to be their king. 
\v 25 All during the time that Solomon was alive, while Rezon was ruling
\add not only Damascus but all of\add* Syria, he was an enemy of Israel and caused trouble for Israel like Hadad did.
\s What Yahweh promised to Jeroboam 
\p
\v 26 Another man who rebelled against [IDI] Solomon was one of his officials named Jeroboam, the son of Nebat. He was from
Zeredah \add town\add* in \add the region where the tribe of\add* Ephraim lives. His mother was a widow named Zeruah.
\p
\v 27 This is what happened. Solomon's workers were filling in the land\f + \ft Or: ground \f* on the east side of Jerusalem and repairing the
walls \add around the city\add*. 
\v 28 Jeroboam was a very capable young man. So, when Solomon saw that he worked very hard, he appointed him to supervise all
the men who were forced to work in the areas where the tribes of Manasseh and Ephraim live.
\p
\v 29 One day when Jeroboam was walking alone along the road outside of Jerusalem, the prophet Ahijah from Shiloh
\add city\add* met him. Ahijah was wearing a new robe, 
\v 30 which he took off and tore into twelve pieces. 
\v 31 He said to Jeroboam, "Take ten of these pieces for yourself, because Yahweh, the God whom we Israelis
\add worship\add*, says to you, 'I am going to tear the kingdom from Solomon, and I am going to enable you to become the ruler
of ten of the tribes \add of Israel\add*. 
\v 32 Solomon's \add descendants\add* will still rule one tribe \f + \ft Or: two tribes \f*, because of
\add what I promised\add* David, a man who served me \add very well\add*, and because of Jerusalem, the city that I have chosen
from all the cities in Israel \add to be the city where my people will worship
me\add*. 
\v 33 I am going to do this because Solomon has rejected me and has been worshiping Astarte, the goddess that the people of
Sidon worship, Chemosh, the god that the Moab people-group worship, and Milcom, the god that the Ammon people-group worship. He
has not conducted his life as I wanted him to. He has not obeyed my statutes and laws, like his father David did.
\p
\v 34 But I will not take the entire kingdom away from him. I will enable him to rule
\add Judah\add* all during the years that he is alive. I will do that because of
\add what I promised\add* to do for David, whom I chose \add to be the
king\add*, and who served me \add well\add*, and who always obeyed my commandments and laws.
\v 35 But I will take the \add other\add* ten tribes of his kingdom and give them to you
\add to rule\add*. 
\v 36 I will allow Solomon's son to rule one tribe, in order that descendants \f + \ft metaphor \f* of David will always rule in Jerusalem, the
city that I have chosen to be the place where \add my people worship\add* me \f + \ft metonymy \f*.
\v 37 I will enable you to become the king of Israel, and you will rule over all the territory that you want to.
\v 38 If you obey all that I command you to do, and conduct your life as I want you to, and if you do what I say is right by
obeying my laws and commandments like David did, I will help you. I will make sure that your descendants will rule after you
\add die\add*, like \add I promised to\add* do for David. 
\v 39 Because of \add Solomon's sins\add*, I will punish David's descendants, but I will not continue to punish them
forever.'Â " 
\p
\v 40 Solomon \add found out what Ahijah told Jeroboam\add*, so he tried to kill Jeroboam. But Jeroboam escaped and went to
Egypt. He went to Shishak, the king of Egypt, and stayed with him until after Solomon died.
\s Solomon died 
\p
\v 41  \add A record of\add* all the other things that Solomon did, and all the wise things that he
\add said\f + \ft Or: wrote \f*\add*, was written in the Book Telling what Solomon Did.
\v 42 He was the king in Jerusalem who ruled over all of Israel for forty years.
\v 43 Then Solomon died \f + \ft euphemism \f*, and was buried in the \add part of Jerusalem
called\add* 'the City of David.' And his son Rehoboam became the king.
