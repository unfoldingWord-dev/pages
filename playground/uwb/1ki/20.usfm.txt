\c 20  
\s The Syrian army attacked Israel 
\p
\v 1 Ben-Hadad, the king of Syria, gathered all his army, and he persuaded 32 other kings to join him with their armies and
horses and chariots. They marched to Samaria \add city, the capital of
Israel\add*, and surrounded it, and \add prepared to\add* attack it.
\v 2 Ben-Hadad sent messengers into the city to King Ahab, to say this to him: "This is what King Ben-Hadad says:
\v 3 '\add You must give to\add* me all your silver and gold, your good-looking\f + \ft Or: most beautiful \f* wives, Or: women and strongest
children.' " 
\p
\v 4 The king of Israel replied to them, "Tell this to King Ben-Hadad: 'I agree to do what you requested. You can have me and
everything that I own.' " 
\p
\v 5  \add The messengers told that to\add* Ben-Hadad, and he \add sent them back
with\add* another message: "I sent a message to you saying that you must give me all your silver and gold and your wives and
your children. 
\v 6 But \add in addition to that\add*, about this time tomorrow, I will send some of my officials to search your palace and
the houses of your officials, and to bring to me everything that pleases them."
\p
\v 7 King Ahab summoned all the leaders of Israel, and said to them, "You can see\f + \ft Or: realize \f* for yourselves that this man is
trying to cause much trouble. He sent me a message insisting that I must give him my wives and my children, my silver and my
gold, and I agreed to do that." 
\p
\v 8 The leaders and all the other people said to him, "Do not pay any attention to him! Do not do what he is requesting!"
\p
\v 9 So Ahab said to Ben-Hadad's messengers, "Tell the king that I agree to give him the things that he first requested, but I
do not agree to allow his officials to take anything that they want from my palace and from the houses of my officials." So the
messengers \add reported that to King Ben-Hadad, and\add* they returned with another message from Ben-Hadad.
\p
\v 10 In that message he said, "\add We will destroy your city completely, with the result
that\add* there will not be enough dust and rubble left for each of my soldiers to have one handful! I hope\f + \ft Or: wish \f* that the gods
will strike me dead if we do not do that!" 
\p
\v 11 King Ahab replied \add to the messengers\add*, "Tell King Ben-Hadad that a soldier who is putting on his armor
\add preparing to fight a battle\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* should not boast at that time; he
\add should wait until\add* after he wins the battle." 
\p
\v 12 Ben-Hadad heard that message while he and the other rulers were drinking
\add wine\add* in their temporary shelters. He told his men to prepare to attack \f + \ft metonymy \f* the city. So his men did that.
\s Ahab's soldiers won their first victory over the Syrians 
\p
\v 13 At that moment, a prophet came to King Ahab and said to him, "This is what Yahweh says:
'\add Do not be at all afraid\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* of the large enemy army that you see! I will enable your army to defeat them today,
and you will know that it is I, Yahweh, \add who has done it\add*.' "
\p
\v 14 Ahab asked, "What group \add of our army\add* will defeat them?" The prophet replied, "The young soldiers who are
commanded by the district governors will do it." The king asked, "Who should lead the attack?" The prophet replied, "You
should!" 
\p
\v 15 So Ahab gathered the young soldiers who were commanded by the district governors. There were 232 of those men. Then he
also summoned all the Israeli army. There were \add only\add* 7,000 soldiers.
\v 16 They started to attack at noon, while Ben-Hadad and the other rulers were getting drunk in their temporary shelters.
\v 17 The young soldiers advanced first. Some scouts who had been sent out by Ben-Hadad reported to him, "There are men coming
out of Samaria \add city\add*"! 
\p
\v 18 He said, "It does not matter whether they are coming to fight against us or to request for peace. Capture them, but do
not kill them!" 
\p
\v 19 The young Israeli soldiers went out of the city to attack \add the Syrian
army\add*, and the other soldiers in the Israeli army followed them.
\v 20 Each \add Israeli soldier\add* killed a \add Syrian\add* soldier. The rest of the Syrian army then ran away, and the
Israeli soldiers pursued them. But King Ben-Hadad escaped riding his horse, along with some other men riding horses.
\v 21 Then the king of Israel went out \add of the city\add*, and he and his soldiers captured
\add all the other Syrian\add* horses and chariots, and also killed a large number of Syrian soldiers.
\p
\v 22 Then that same prophet went to King Ahab and said to him, "Go back and prepare your soldiers, and think carefully about
what will be necessary for you to do, because the king of Syria with attack with his army again in the springtime of next
year." 
\p
\v 23  \add After the Syrian army was defeated\add*, Ben-Hadad's officials said to him, "The gods that the Israelis
\add worship\add* are gods \add who live in\add* the hills. \add Samaria is built on a
hill\add*, and that is why their soldiers were able to defeat us. But if we fight against them in the plains\f + \ft Or: lowlands \f*, we
certainly will be able to defeat them. 
\v 24 So, this is what you should do: You must remove the 32 kings
\add who are leading your troops\add* and replace them with army commanders.
\v 25 Then gather an army like the army that was defeated. Gather an army that has as many horses and chariots as the first
army had. Then we will fight the Israelis in the plains\f + \ft Or: lowlands \f*, and we will surely defeat them."
\p Ben-Hadad agreed with them, and he did what they suggested. 
\v 26 In the spring of the following year, he gathered his soldiers and marched
\add with them\add* to Aphek \add city east of Galilee Lake\add*, to fight against the Israeli army.
\v 27 The Israeli army was also gathered together, and they were given the things that they needed
\add for the battle\add*. Then they marched out and formed two groups facing the Syrian army. Their army was very small; they
resembled two small flocks of goats, whereas the Syrian army \add was very large
and\add* spread all over the countryside. 
\p
\v 28 A prophet came to King Ahab and said to him, "This is what Yahweh says: 'The Syrians say that I am a god who lives in the
hills, and that I am not a god who lives in the valleys. So I will
\add show that they are wrong by\add* enabling your men to defeat this huge army [IDI]
\add in the valley\add*, and you will know that I, Yahweh, \add have done
it\add*.' " 
\p
\v 29 The two armies stayed in their tents for seven days, in groups that faced each other. Then, on the seventh day, they
started fighting. The Israeli army killed 100,000 Syrian soldiers.
\v 30 The other Syrian soldiers ran away into Aphek city. Then the wall of the city collapsed and killed 27,000 more Syrian
soldiers. 
\p Ben-Hadad also escaped into the city, and hid in the back room of a house.
\v 31 His officials went to him and said, "We have heard a report that the Israelis act mercifully. So allow us to go to the
king of Israel, wearing course sacks around our waists and ropes on our heads\f + \ft Or: necks \f*
\add to indicate that we will be his slaves\add*. Perhaps \add if we do
that\add*, he will allow you to remain alive." 
\p
\v 32  \add The king permitted them to do that\add*, so they wrapped coarse sacks around their waists and put ropes on their
heads\f + \ft Or: necks \f*, and they went to the king of Israel and said to him, "Ben-Hadad, who greatly respects you, says, 'Please do not
kill me.' " Ahab replied, "Is he still alive? He is like a brother to me!"
\p
\v 33 Ben-Hadad's officials were trying to find out if Ahab would act mercifully, and when Ahab said "brother," they were
optimistic\f + \ft Or: thought that Ahab would be merciful \f*. So they replied, "Yes, he is like your brother!" Ahab said, "Go and bring him
to me." So they \add went and\add* brought Ben-Hadad to him. \add When Ben-Hadad
arrived\add*, Ahab told him to get in the chariot \add and sit\add*
\add with him\add*. 
\p
\v 34 Ben-Hadad said to him, "I will give back to you the towns that my father's army took from your father. And I will allow
you to set up market areas for your merchants in Damascus \add my
capital\add*, just as my father did in Samaria \add your capital\add*." Ahab replied, "Because you agree to do that, I will not
execute you." So Ahab made an agreement with Ben-Hadad, and allowed him to go home.
\p
\v 35 Then Yahweh spoke to a member of a group of prophets and told him to request a fellow prophet to strike\f + \ft Or: wound \f* him. But
that man refused to do it. 
\p
\v 36 So the prophet said to him, "Because you refused to obey what Yahweh told you to do, a lion will kill you as soon as you
leave me." And as soon as he left that prophet, a lion suddenly met him and killed him.
\p
\v 37 Then the prophet found another prophet, and said to him, "Strike me!" So that man hit him
\add very hard and\add* injured him. 
\v 38 Then the prophet put a large bandage\f + \ft Or: cloth \f* over his face so that no one would recognize him. Then he went and stood
alongside the road, waiting for the king to come by. 
\v 39 When the king passed by, the prophet cried out to him, saying "Your majesty,
\add after I was wounded\add* while I was fighting in a battle, a soldier brought to me one of our enemies that he had
captured, and said to me, 'Guard this man! If he escapes, you must pay me 3,000 pieces of silver, and if you do not pay that,
you will be executed!' 
\v 40 But while I was busy doing other things, the man escaped!" The king of Israel said to him, "That is your problem! You
yourself have said that you deserve to be punished." 
\p
\v 41 The prophet immediately took off the bandage, and the king of Israel recognized that he was one of the prophets.
\v 42 And the prophet said to him, "This is what Yahweh says: 'You have allowed that man
\add Ben-Hadad\add* to escape after I commanded you to be sure to execute him! Since you did not do that, you will be killed
instead. And your army will be destroyed because you allowed \add some
of\add* his army to escape!' " 
\v 43 The king went back home to Samaria, very angry and depressed\f + \ft Or: dejected \f*.
