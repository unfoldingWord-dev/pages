\c 12  
\s The ten tribes rebelled against Rehoboam 
\p
\v 1 All \f + \fk hyperbole \f* the people of \add northern\add* Israel went to Shechem
\add city\add* in order to appoint Rehoboam to be their king. So Rehoboam also went there.
\v 2 When Jeroboam, who was still in Egypt, heard about that, he returned from Egypt
\add to Israel\add*. 
\v 3 The \add leaders of the northern tribes\add* summoned him, and they went together
\add to talk\add* to Rehoboam. They said to him, 
\v 4 “Your father \add Solomon\add* forced us to work very hard \f + \fk metaphor \f* for him. If you ◄lighten these loads/do not force us to
work that hard►, and if you charge us less taxes than we were paying to him, we will serve you
\add faithfully\add*.” 
\p
\v 5 He replied, “Go away, and come back three days from now \add and I will give you my
answer\add*.” So those leaders and Jeroboam left. 
\p
\v 6 Then King Rehoboam consulted his older men who had advised his father Solomon while he was still living. He asked them,
“What shall I say to answer these men?” 
\p
\v 7 They replied, “If you want to serve these people well, speak kindly to them when you reply to them. If you do that, they
will always serve you faithfully.” 
\p
\v 8 But he ignored what the older men advised him to do. Instead, he consulted the younger men who had grown up with him, who
were now ◄his advisors/the ones who told him what would be good to do►.
\v 9 He said to them, “What do you say that I should answer the men who are asking me to reduce the
\add work and taxes\add* that my father required from them?” 
\p
\v 10 They replied, “This is what you should tell them: ‘My little finger is thicker than my father's waist.
\v 11 What I mean is that my father required you to \add work hard and pay high
taxes\add*. But I will make those loads heavier. \add It was as though\add* my father whipped you, but I will whip you with
whips that have pieces of metal in them.’ ” 
\p
\v 12 So three days later, Jeroboam and all the leaders came to Rehoboam again, which is what he had told them to do.
\v 13 The king ignored the advice of the older men and spoke harshly to the Israeli leaders.
\v 14  \add He told them what the younger men had advised\add*. He said, “My father put heavy burdens
\add of work and taxes\add* on you, but I will put heavier burdens on you.
\add It was as though\add* he beat you with whips, but I will beat you with whips that have pieces of metal in them!”
\v 15 So the king did not pay any attention to the Israeli leaders. But this happened in order that what Yahweh wanted would
occur, what he had told the prophet Ahijah about Jeroboam \add becoming king of the ten
tribes\add*. 
\p
\v 16 When the Israeli leaders realized that the king did not pay any attention to what they said, they shouted,
\q “We do not \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* want anything to do with this descendant of King David!
\q2 We will not pay attention to what this grandson of Jesse says!
\q You people of Israel, let's go home! 
\q2 As for this descendant of David \f + \fk metonymy \f*, he can rule his own kingdom \f + \fk metonymy \f*!”
\p So the Israeli leaders returned to their homes. 
\v 17 And \add after that\add*, the \add only Israeli\add* people whom Rehoboam ruled over were those who lived in the
territory of \add the tribe of\add* Judah. 
\p
\v 18 Then King Rehoboam went with Adoniram \add to talk to the Israeli
people\add*. Adoniram was the man who supervised \add all the men who
were\add* forced to work \add for Rehoboam\add*. But the Israeli people killed him by throwing stones at him. When that
happened, King Rehoboam quickly got in his chariot and escaped to Jerusalem.
\v 19 Ever since that time, the people of the \add northern tribes
of\add* Israel have been rebelling against the descendants \f + \fk metonymy \f* of
\add King\add* David. 
\p
\v 20 When the Israeli people heard that Jeroboam had returned \add from
Egypt\add*, they invited him to come to a meeting, and there they appointed him to be the king of Israel. Only the people of
the tribe of Judah continued to be loyal to \add the kings descended from
King\add* \f + \fk metonymy \f* David. 
\p
\v 21 When Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem, he gathered 180,000 of the best soldiers from the tribes \f + \fk metonymy \f* of Judah and Benjamin.
He wanted them to fight against the northern tribes of \f + \fk metonymy \f* Israel
\add and defeat them\add*, in order that he could \add rule all the tribes
of\add* his kingdom again. 
\p
\v 22 But God spoke to the prophet Shemaiah and said this to him:
\v 23 “Go and tell this to \add Solomon's son\add* Rehoboam, the king of Judah, and to all the people of the tribes of Judah
and Benjamin and the people from the northern tribe who live in Judah:
\v 24 ‘Yahweh says that you must not go to fight against your own relatives, the people of Israel. All of you must go home.
What has happened is what Yahweh wanted to happen.’ ” \add So Shemaiah went and told that to
them\add*, and they all heeded what Yahweh had commanded them to do, and they went home.
\s Jeroboam's sins 
\p
\v 25 Then Jeroboam's workers built \add walls around\add* Shechem
\add city\add* in the hilly area \add where the descendants\add* of Ephraim lived, and he ruled from there for a while. He and
his workers then left there and went to Peniel \add town\add*, and they built walls around that town.
\p
\v 26-27 Then Jeroboam said to himself, “If my people \add continue
to\add* go to Jerusalem and offer sacrifices to Yahweh at the temple there, soon they will again become loyal to Rehoboam, the
king of Judah \f + \fk doublet \f*, and they will kill me.” 
\p
\v 28 So he consulted \add his advisors, and then he did what they
suggested\add*. He \add told his workers to\add* make gold \add statues
of\add* two calves. Then he said to the people, “You have been going to Jerusalem
\add to worship\add* for a long time. It is a big trouble for you to continue going there. You people of Israel, look! These
statues are the gods that brought our \add ancestors\add* up from Egypt!
\add So you can worship these, here\add*!” 
\v 29 He \add told his workers to\add* place one of the statues in Bethel
\add city in the south\add* and one in Dan \add city in the north\add*.
\v 30 So \add what Jeroboam did caused\add* the people to sin. Some of them went and worshiped the calf at Bethel, and others
went and worshiped the other calf at Dan. 
\p
\v 31  \add Moses had declared that only men from the tribe of Levi would be priests,
but\add* Jeroboam also told his workers to build shrines on hilltops, and then he appointed men who were not from the tribe of
Levi to be priests. 
\v 32 He also established Adonijah and two priests, Elishama and Jehoram. They had a celebration at the end of October, like
the celebration \add of living in temporary shelters\add* that occurred in Judah
\add each year\add*. On the altar \add that they built\add* in Bethel, he offered sacrifices to the gold statues of calves that
they had made, and he stationed the priests there at the shrines that his workers had built.
\v 33 Rehoboam went up to that altar on that day in October which he himself had chosen. There on that altar he burned incense
\add to be a sacrifice\add*. And he declared that the people should celebrate that festival
\add on that same day every year\add*.
