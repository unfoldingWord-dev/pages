\c 16  
\s When Baasha ruled Israel 
\p
\v 1 During the time that Baasha \add was king of Israel\add*, \add the
prophet\add* Jehu, Hanani's son, gave Baasha this message that he had received from Yahweh:
\v 2 "You were very insignificant\f + \ft Or: unimportant \f* [IDI] when I caused you to become the ruler of my Israeli people. But you have
caused me to become very angry by doing [IDI] the kinds of evil things that King Jeroboam did. You have also caused me to
become angry by causing my people to sin. 
\v 3 So now I will get rid of you and your family \f + \ft metonymy \f*. I will do to you just like I did to Jeroboam and his family.
\v 4  \add The bodies of\add* those in your family who die in this city
\add will not be buried; they will\add* be eaten by dogs; and \add the bodies
of\add* those who die in the fields will be eaten by vultures." 
\p
\v 5 The other things that Baasha did during the time that he ruled Israel, and the great things that his
\add army\add* did, are written \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* in the book named 'The History of the Kings of Israel.'
\v 6 When Baasha died, he was buried in Tirzah, \add the capital
city\add*. Then his son Elah became king. 
\p
\v 7 Yahweh gave that message about Baasha and his family to the prophet Jehu. Baasha had done many deeds that Yahweh said were
evil, which caused Yahweh to become angry. Baasha did the same kind of deeds that King Jeroboam and his family had done
previously. Yahweh was also angry with Baasha because he had killed all of Jeroboam's family.
\s When Elah ruled Israel 
\p
\v 8 After Asa had been the king of Judah for almost 26 years, Elah became the king of Israel. Elah ruled in Tirzah for
\add only\add* two years. 
\p
\v 9  \add A man named\add* Zimri was one of Elah's army officers. He commanded the drivers of half of Elah's army's
chariots\f + \ft Or: two-wheeled vehicles pulled by horses \f*. He made plans to kill Elah while Elah was in Tirzah, getting drunk at the
house of \add a man named\add* Arza. Arza was the man who took care of the things in the king's palace.
\v 10 Zimri went into Arza's house and killed Elah. Then Zimri became the king of Israel. That was when Asa had been the king
of Judah for 27 years. 
\s When Zimri was king 
\p
\v 11 As soon as Zimri became king \f + \ft metonymy \f*, he killed all of Baasha's family \f + \ft metonymy \f*. He killed every male [IDI] in Baasha's family
and all of Baasha's male friends. 
\v 12 So he got rid of all of Baasha's family. That was just what Yahweh told the prophet Jehu would happen.
\v 13 Baasha and his son Elah had sinned and induced the Israeli people to sin. They caused Yahweh, the God whom the Israel
people worshiped, to become angry, because they both urged the people
\add to worship\add* worthless idols. 
\p
\v 14 Everything else that Elah did is written in the book named 'The History of the Kings of Israel.'
\s When Zimri ruled Israel 
\p
\v 15 So Zimri became the king of Israel after Asa had been king of Judah for 27 years. But Zimri ruled in Tirzah for only
seven days. The Israeli army was beseiging\f + \ft Or: surrounding \f* Gibeah, a town which belonged to the Philistine people-group.
\v 16 The men in the Israeli army camp heard that Zimri had secretly planned to kill King Elah, and then had killed him. So on
that day the soldiers chose Omri, the commander of their army, to become the king of Israel.
\v 17 The Israeli army was camped near Gibbethon \add city\add*. When they heard what Zimri had done, they left there and went
to Tirzah, and surrounded the city. 
\v 18 When Zimri realized that the city was \add about to be\add* captured, he went into his palace and set it on fire. So the
palace burned down, and he died \add in the fire\add*. 
\v 19 He died because he had sinned by doing the things that Yahweh said were evil. Jeroboam had induced the Israeli people to
sin, and Zimri sinned just like Jeroboam had sinned. 
\p
\v 20 All the other things that Zimri did, and the record of how he rebelled
\add against King Elah\add*, are written in the book named 'The History of the Kings of Israel.'
\s When Omri ruled Israel 
\p
\v 21 After Zimri died, the Israeli people were divided among themselves. One group wanted Tibni, the son of Ginath, to be
their king. The other group wanted Omri \add to be the king\add*.
\v 22 Those who supported Omri were stronger than\f + \ft Or: defeated \f* those who supported Tibni. So Tibni was killed, and Omri became
king. 
\p
\v 23 Omri became king when Asa had been king of Judah for almost 31 years. Omri ruled Israel for 12 years. For the first six
years he ruled in Tirzah. 
\v 24 Then he bought a hill from \add a man named\add* Shemer and paid him about 150 pounds\f + \ft Or: 70 kg. \f* of silver for it. Then
Omri ordered his men to build a city on that hill, and he called it Samaria, to honor Shemer, the man who owned it previously.
\p
\v 25 But Omri did many things that Yahweh said were evil. He did more evil deeds than any of the kings who ruled Israel before
he did. 
\v 26 When Jeroboam \add was previously the king\add*, he had induced the Israeli people to sin, and Omri committed the same
kind of sins that Jeroboam did. The Israeli people caused Yahweh, the God the Israeli people had worshiped, to become very
angry, because they worshiped worthless idols. 
\p
\v 27 Everything that Omri did, and the record of the victories that his
\add army\add* won, are written in the book named 'The History of the Kings of Israel.'
\v 28 After Omri died, he was buried in Samaria, and his son Ahab became king.
\s When Ahab ruled Israel 
\p
\v 29 Ahab became king of Israel when Asa had ruled Judah for almost 38 years. Ahab ruled in Samaria
\add city\add* for 22 years. 
\v 30 Ahab did many things that Yahweh said were evil. He did more evil deeds than any of the kings who ruled Israel before he
did. 
\v 31 He committed the same kind of sins that Jeroboam did, but he did things that were worse than the things that Jeroboam
did. He married \add a woman named\add* Jezebel, the daughter of Ethbaal, the king of Sidon
\add city\add*. Then Ahab started to worship Baal, \add the god that the Canaan people-group
worshiped\add*. 
\v 32 He built a temple in Samaria in order that the Israeli people could worship Baal there, and he put an altar there for
\add making sacrifices to\add* Baal. 
\v 33 He also made an idol that represented Asherah, \add Baal's
wife\add*. He did many more things that caused Yahweh to become angry. He did more evil things than any of the previous kings
of Israel had done. 
\p
\v 34 During the years that Ahab \add ruled\add*, Hiel, a man from Bethel
\add city\add*, rebuilt Jericho \add city\add*. But when he started to rebuild the city, his oldest son Abiram died. And when
\add the city was finished\add*, while Hiel \add was building\add* the city gates, his youngest son Segub died. They died just
like Yahweh had told Joshua would happen \add to the sons of anyone who would rebuild
Jericho\add*.
