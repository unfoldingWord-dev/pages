\s They built a palace for Solomon 
\p
\v 1 They also built a palace for Solomon, but it required thirteen years to build it.
\v 2 One of the buildings they built was a large \add ceremonial
hall\add*. It was called the Hall of the Forest of Lebanon. It was 150 feet long, 75 feet wide, and 45 feet high. It
\add was supported\f + \ft Or: held \f* up by\add* four rows of cedar pillars. There were 15 pillars in each row. There were cedar beams across
each row. 
\v 3  \add To support the roof\add* there were cedar beams that connected the rows of pillars.
\v 4 On each of the two side walls there were three rows of windows.
\v 5 All the windows and doorways had rectangular frames. The windows along the long wall on one side faced the windows on the
other side. 
\p
\v 6 They also built another building called the Hall of Pillars. It was 75 feet long and 45 feet wide. It had a covered porch
\add whose roof\add* was supported by pillars. 
\p
\v 7 Then they made a building called the Hall of the Throne. It was also called the Hall of Judgment. That was where Solomon
decided\f + \ft Or: judged \f* concerning people's disputes. The walls were covered with cedar boards, from the floor to the rafters.
\p
\v 8 In the courtyard behind the Hall of Judgment they built a house for Solomon to live in that was made like the other
buildings. They also built the same kind of house for his wife, who was the daughter of the king of Egypt.
\p
\v 9 All of these buildings and the walls around the palace courtyard were made from nice stones, from the foundations up to
the eaves. The stones were cut \add at the quarry\add*, according to the sizes that were needed, and the sides of the stones
were shaped by cutting\f + \ft Or: smoothing \f* them with saws. 
\v 10 The foundations were also made from huge blocks of nice stones
\add that were prepared at the quarry\add*. Some of them were twelve feet long and some were fifteen feet long.
\v 11 On top of the foundation stones were other nice stones that were cut according to the sizes they needed, and cedar beams.
\v 12 The palace courtyard, the inner courtyard in front of the temple, and the entrance room of the temple had walls made by
putting down three layers of cut stones between each layer of cedar beams.
\s Other things for the temple area 
\p
\v 13-14 There was a man who lived in Tyre \add city\add* whose name was Huram. He ◄was a craftsman\f + \ft Or: knew \f* how to make very nice
things from bronze►. His father had also lived in Tyre and had also been very skilled at making things from bronze, but Huram's
father was no longer living. His mother was from the tribe of Naphtali. Huram was very wise and intelligent and was very
skilled at making things from bronze. Solomon invited him to come
\add to Jerusalem and supervise\add* all the work of making things from bronze, and Huram agreed.
\p
\v 15 He made two bronze pillars. Each one was 27 feet tall and 18 feet around it. Each was hollow, and the walls of the
pillars were 3 in.\f + \ft Or: 7.4 cm. \f* thick. 
\v 16 He also made two bronze heads\f + \ft Or: tops \f* to be put on top of the pillars. Each head\f + \ft Or: top \f* was 7-1\f + \ft Or: 2 \f* feet tall.
\v 17 Then he made bronze wreaths of chains to decorate the head\f + \ft Or: top \f* of each pillar.
\v 18 He also made bronze \add figures that resembled\add* pomegranates. He put two rows of pomegranates over the head\f + \ft Or: top \f* of
each pillar. 
\v 19 The head\f + \ft Or: top \f* over each pillar was shaped like a lily. Each
\add lily leaf\add* was six feet tall. 
\v 20 These heads\f + \ft Or: tops \f* were placed on a bowl-shaped section around which was draped the wreaths of chains. He made 200
\add figures that represented\add* pomegranates and put them in two rows around the head\f + \ft Or: top \f* of each pillar.
\v 21 His \add helpers\add* set up the pillars in front of the entrance of the temple. The pillar on the south side was named
Jakin, and the pillar on the north side was named Boaz. 
\v 22 The bronze heads\f + \ft Or: tops \f* that were shaped like lilies were placed on top of the pillars.
\p So Huram and his helpers completed the work of making the bronze pillars.
\p
\v 23 Huram also made a very large round bronze tank that was made of metal and cast
\add in a clay mold\add*. It was 7-1\f + \ft Or: 2 ft.( Or: 2 ).3 meters► high, ◄30 ft.\f + \ft Or: 9 \f* meters► wide\f + \ft Or: across \f*, and ◄45 ft., Or: 13.5 meters \f*around it.
\v 24 Around the outer edge of the rim of the tank were two rows of
\add figures that resembled\add* gourds that were made of bronze. But the gourds
\add were not cast separately; they\add* were cast in the same mold as the rest of the tank. For each foot of length around the
rim of the tank there were six gourds. 
\p
\v 25 Huram \add also cast\add* twelve \add bronze statues of\add* oxen. He placed them to face outward. He placed three of
them to face north, three to face west, three to face south, and three to face east. His helpers put the bronze tank on the
backs of \add the statues of\add* the oxen. 
\v 26 The sides \add of the tank\add* were 3 in.\f + \ft Or: 8 cm. \f*thick. The rim was like the rim of a cup. It
\add curved outward\add*, like the petals of a lily. \add When the tank was
full\add*, it held about 10,000 gallons \add of water\add*. 
\p
\v 27 Huram also made ten bronze carts. Each was six feet long and six feet wide and 4-1\f + \ft Or: 2 \f* feet tall.
\v 28  \add On the sides of the carts\add* there were panels\f + \ft Or: boards \f* which were set in frames.
\v 29 On those panels were \add bronze figures of\add* lions, bulls, and winged creatures. Below and above the lions and bulls
there were decorations of bronze wreaths. 
\v 30 Each cart had four bronze wheels and two axles made of bronze. At the top corners of each cart were bronze supports to
hold up a basin. On these supports were also decorations of bronze wreaths.
\v 31 On top of each cart, \add under each basin\add*, was a frame
\add that resembled\add* a circular collar. The top of each circular frame was 18 inches above the top of the cart, and the
bottom of it was nine inches below the top of the cart. There were also decorations of bronze wreaths on the frame engraved
within square panels. 
\v 32 The wheels were 27 inches high. They were below the panels. The wheels were connected to axles that had been cast in the
same mold as the rest of the cart. 
\v 33 The wheels of the carts were like the wheels of chariots. The axles, the rims, the spokes, and the hubs were all cast
\add from bronze\add*. 
\p
\v 34 At the top corners of each cart there were handles. These were cast in the same mold as the rest of the cart.
\v 35 There was a nine inch bronze band around the top of each cart. There were braces attached to the corners of each cart.
The bands and the braces were cast in the same mold as the rest of the cart.
\v 36 The braces and the panels \add on the sides of the carts\add* were also decorated with
\add figures of\add* winged creatures, lions, and palm trees, whenever there was space for them, and there were bronze wreaths
all around them. 
\v 37 That is how Huram made the ten carts. They \add were all cast in the same mold, so
they\add* were all alike: they all were the same size and had the same shape.
\p
\v 38 Huram also made ten bronze basins, one for each cart. Each basin was six feet across and held 200 gallons
\add of water\add*. 
\v 39 Huram placed five of the carts on the south side of the temple and five on the north side. He put the big tank at the
southeast corner. 
\v 40 Huram also made pots, shovels \add for carrying ashes\add*, and bowls
\add for carrying the blood of the animals that would be sacrificed\add*. He completed all the work that King Solomon requested
him to do for the temple. \add This is a list of the bronze things he
made:\add* 
\li
\v 41 the two pillars; 
\li the two heads\f + \ft Or: tops \f* to be put on top of the pillars; 
\li the two wreaths of chains to decorate the heads\f + \ft Or: tops \f* of the pillars;
\li
\v 42 the 400 \add figures of\add* pomegranates, in two rows, with 100 in each row, that were placed over the heads\f + \ft Or: tops \f* of the
pillars; 
\li
\v 43 the ten carts; 
\li the ten basins; 
\li
\v 44 the big tank; 
\li the twelve \add statues of\add* oxen on whose backs the tank was placed;
\li
\v 45 the pots, shovels \add for the ashes of the altar\add*, and bowls.
\b
\p Huram \add and his workers\add* made all these things for King Solomon and put them outside the temple. They were all made
of polished bronze. 
\p
\v 46 They made them by pouring melted bronze into the clay molds that Huram had set up near the Jordan
\add River\add* valley, between Succoth and Zarethan \add cities\add*.
\p
\v 47 Solomon did not \add tell his workers to\add* weigh those bronze objects, because there were many items. So no one ever
knew what they weighed. 
\b
\p
\v 48 Solomon's \add workers\add* also made all the gold items for the temple:
\li the altar; 
\li the table on which the priests put the sacred bread placed before God;
\li
\v 49 the ten lampstands \add that were put\add* in front of the Very Holy Place, five on the south side and five on the north
side; 
\li the \add decorations that resembled\add* flowers; 
\li the lamps; 
\li the tongs \add to grasp the hot coals\add*; 
\li
\v 50 the cups, the gold lamp wick snuffers, the small lamp bowls, the dishes for incense, the pans
\add for carrying the hot coals\add*, and the hinges for the doors at the entrance to the Very Holy Place and for the doors at
the entrance \add to the main room\add* of the temple. 
\li Those things were all made of gold. 
\b
\p
\v 51 So Solomon's \add workers\add* finished all the work for the temple. Then they placed in the temple storerooms all the
things that his father David had dedicated to Yahweh—all the silver and gold, and the other valuable items.
