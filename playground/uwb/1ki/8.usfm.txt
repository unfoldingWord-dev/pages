\c 8  
\s The sacred chest was brought to the temple 
\p
\v 1 Solomon then summoned to Jerusalem all the elders of Israel, all the leaders of the tribes and the leaders of the clans.
He arranged wanted them to join in bringing \add to the temple\add* Yahweh's Sacred Chest from Zion Hill, where it was in the
part of the city called 'the City of David'. 
\v 2 So all the Israeli leaders came to King Solomon during the Festival of
\add Living in Temporary\add* Shelters, in October. 
\p
\v 3 When they had all arrived, the priests lifted up the Sacred Chest
\v 4 and brought it to the temple. The descendants of Levi \add who assisted the
priests\add* helped them to carry to the temple the Sacred Tent and all the sacred things that had been in the tent.
\v 5 Then King Solomon and many of \f + \ft hyperbole \f* the Israeli people who had gathered in front of Yahweh's Sacred Chest. And they
sacrificed a huge amount of sheep and oxen. No one was able to count the sacrifices
\add because there were very many\add*. 
\p
\v 6 Then the priests then brought the Sacred Chest into the Very Holy Place in the temple, and they placed it under the wings
of the \add statues of the\add* winged creatures. 
\v 7 The wings of those statues spread out over the Sacred Chest and over the poles by which it was carried.
\v 8 The poles were very long, with the result that the ends of the poles could be seen by
\add people who were standing at\add* the entrance to the Most Holy Place, but they could not be seen
\add by people standing\add* outside the temple. Those poles are still there.
\v 9 The only things that were in the Sacred Chest were the two stone tablets that Moses had put there at Sinai Mountain, where
Yahweh made an agreement with the people\f + \ft Or: told the people what he wanted them to do \f* after they left Egypt.
\p
\v 10  \add The priests put the Sacred Chest in the temple\add*. When they came out of the temple,
\add suddenly\add* it was filled with a cloud. 
\v 11 The glory\f + \ft Or: radiance \f* of Yahweh filled the temple, with the result that the priests were not able to continue their work.
\p
\v 12 Then Solomon prayed this: 
\q "Yahweh, you have placed the sun in the sky, 
\q but you have decided that you would live in very dark \add clouds\add*.
\q
\v 13 I have built for you a splendid\f + \ft Or: magnificent \f* temple, 
\q2 a place for you to live in forever." 
\p
\v 14 Then, while all the people stood there, the king turned around and faced them, and he
\add asked God to\add* bless them. 
\v 15 He said, "Praise Yahweh, the God whom we Israelis \add belong\add*! By his own power \f + \ft metonymy \f* he has done what he promised
to my father David. What he promised was this: 
\pi
\v 16 From the time that I brought my people out of Egypt, I have never chosen any city in Israel in which a temple should be
built for my people to worship me there. But I chose you, David, to rule my people."
\p
\v 17  \add Then Solomon said\add*, "My father David wanted [IDI] to build a temple in order that we Israeli people could
worship Yahweh our God there. 
\v 18 But Yahweh said to him, 'You have wanted to build a temple for me, and what you wanted to do was good.
\v 19 However, I you are not the one not \add who I want\add* to build it. It is one of your sons, who
\add I want to\add* build a \f + \ft metonymy \f* temple for me.' 
\p
\v 20 And now Yahweh has done what he promised to do. I have become the king of Israel to succeed my father, and I am ruling my
people, like Yahweh promised. I have \add arranged for\add* this temple to be built for us Israelis to worship Yahweh \f + \ft metonymy \f*,
the God, to whom we Israelis belong. 
\v 21 I have also provided a place \add in the temple\add* for the Sacred Chest in which are the two stone tablets
\add on which are engraved the Ten Commandments of\add* the agreement that Yahweh made with our ancestors when he brought them
out of Egypt." 
\s Solomon's prayer 
\p
\v 22 Then Solomon stood in front of the altar which was in front of the Israeli people who had gathered there. He spread out
his arms toward heaven, 
\v 23 and he prayed, 
\pi "Yahweh, the God whom we Israeli people \add worship\f + \ft Or: belong \f* to\add*, there is no god like you up in heaven or down here on
the earth. You solemnly promised that you would faithfully love us. And that is what you have done for us who earnestly [IDI]
do what you want us to do. 
\pi
\v 24 You have done the things that you promised my father David, who served you
\add very well\add*, that you would do. Truly, you promised to do these things for him, and today we see that by your power
\f + \ft metonymy \f* you have today. 
\pi
\v 25 So now, Yahweh, the God whom we Israelis \add worship\f + \ft Or: belong \f*
to\add*, please do the things that you promised my father that you would do. You told him that there would always be some of
his descendants who would rule\f + \ft metonymy \f* Israel, if they would conduct their lives as he did.
\v 26 So now, God of us Israeli people, cause what you promised to do for my father David, who served you
\add well\add*, to happen. 
\pi
\v 27 But God, will you really live on the earth among people?\f + \ft Or: you cannot really live on the earth. \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* There is surely not
\f + \ft rhetorical question \f* enough space for you in the sky, or even in the heaven. So there is surely not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* enough space for you to live in this
temple that my workers have built. 
\v 28 But Yahweh, my God, please listen to me while I am praying to you this day,
\v 29 Please be protecting \f + \ft metonymy \f* this temple night and day. This is the place about which you have said, 'I \f + \ft metonymy \f* will always
be there \f + \ft metonymy \f*.' I request that you listen to me whenever I turn my face toward this temple and pray.
\v 30 I request that when I pray to you and your people pray to you while they turn their faces toward this place, that in your
home in heaven you will hear us and forgive us \add for the sins that we have
committed\add*. 
\pi
\v 31 If people accuse someone {someone is accused} of doing something wrong to another person, and they bring him to your
altar outside this holy temple, and if he says, 'I did not do that; may God punish me if I am not telling the truth,'
\v 32 then you listen from heaven, and decide who is telling the truth. Then punish the person who is guilty as he deserves to
be punished, and declare that the other person is innocent\f + \ft Or: has not done what is wrong \f*.
\pi
\v 33 And when your Israeli people are defeated by their enemies
\add in a battle\add* because they have sinned against you, \add and if they are forced to go to some distant
country\add*, if they turn away from their sinful behavior and turn toward this temple and acknowledge\f + \ft Or: admit \f* that you \f + \ft metonymy \f*
\add have justly punished them\add*, and if they plead \add that you will forgive
them\add*, 
\v 34 listen to them from heaven, and forgive your Israeli people for the sins that they
\add have committed\add*, and bring them back to this land that you gave to our ancestors.
\pi
\v 35 And when you do not allow any rain to fall \f + \ft doublet, metonymy \f* on the land because your people have sinned against you, if they
turn toward this temple and admit that you \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add have justly punished
them\add*, if they turn away from their sinful behavior and \add humbly\add* pray to you,
\v 36 listen to them in heaven, and forgive your Israeli people for the sins
\add that they have committed\add*. Teach them the right way to conduct their lives. Then send rain on this land that you have
given to your people to belong to them \add permanently\add*. 
\pi
\v 37 And when the people of this land experience famines, or if there is a plague\f + \ft Or: illness that causes many people to become
sick \f*, or if \add their crops are destroyed by\add* blight\f + \ft Or: very hot winds \f* or by mildew or by locusts or grasshoppers, or when
their enemies surround any of their cities \add in order to attack
them\add*, if any of those bad things happen to them, 
\v 38 when your Israeli people earnestly plead \f + \ft doublet \f* with you knowing in their inner beings that they are suffering
\add because they have sinned\add*, and if they stretch out their arms toward this temple and pray,
\v 39 listen to them from your home in heaven, and forgive them, and help them. You are the only one who knows what people are
thinking \f + \ft metonymy \f*, so act toward each person as he deserves, 
\v 40 in order that your people may then have an awesome respect for you, all the years that they live in this land that you
gave to our ancestors. 
\pi
\v 41-42 There will be some foreigners who do not belong to your Israeli people who have come here from countries far away
because they have heard that you are very great and that you \f + \ft metonymy \f* perform great miracles \f + \ft metonymy \f*. If they come here to this
temple to worship you \f + \ft metonymy \f* and prays, 
\v 43 in your home in heaven, listen to his prayer, and do for them what they request you to do. Do that in order that all the
people-groups in the world will know about you and revere you, like we your Israeli people do. And then they will know that
this temple that I have \add caused to be\add* built to honor you \f + \ft metonymy \f*,
\add and is where you should be worshiped\add*. 
\pi
\v 44 And if you send your people to go to fight against their enemies, if they pray to you, wherever they are, if they turn
toward this city that you have chosen and toward this temple that I have caused to be built for you,
\v 45 listen in heaven to their prayers; listen to what they plead for you to do, and assist them.
\pi
\v 46  \add It is true that\add* everyone sins \f + \ft litotes \f*. So, if your people sin against you, and you become angry with them, you
may allow their enemies to defeat them and capture them and take them away to their enemies' country, even to countries that
are far away. 
\v 47 If that happens, while they are in those countries to which they were forced to go, if they sincerely repent and plead
with you there saying 'We have sinned and have done things that are very wicked \f + \ft doublet \f*,'
\v 48 if they very truly and sincerely repent, and turn toward this land that you gave to our ancestors, and toward this city
that you have chosen \add to be the place where we should worship
you\add*, and toward this temple that I have \add caused to be\add* built for you,, and pray,
\v 49 then from your home in heaven listen to them while they plead
\add for your help\add*, and assist them. 
\v 50 Forgive them for all the sins \f + \ft doublet \f* that they \add have committed\add* against you and cause their enemies to act kindly
toward them. 
\v 51 Do not forget that the Israelis are your people; they are your special possession; you brought
\add our ancestors\add* out of Egypt where \add they were greatly suffering as
though\add* they were in a blazing furnace. 
\pi
\v 52 I request that you always listen to \f + \ft metonymy \f* your Israeli people and to their king, and heed their prayers whenever they
call out to you \add to help them\add*. 
\v 53 You chose them from all the other people-groups in the world to belong to you, which is what you told Moses to tell them
when you brought our ancestors out of Egypt." 
\b
\p
\v 54 After Solomon had finished praying this and pleading to Yahweh
\add for his help\add*, he stood up in front of the altar where he had been kneeling. He lifted up his arms.
\v 55 Then he \add asked God to\add* bless all the Israeli people.
\add He prayed\add* loudly, saying, 
\pi
\v 56 "Praise Yahweh, who has given us his people peace, like he promised that he would do. He has done every one of the good
things that he promised to Moses, the man who served him \add very
well\add*. 
\v 57 I pray that our God will be with us like he was with our ancestors, and that he will never, never abandon us \f + \ft doublet \f*.
\v 58 I pray that he will cause us \f + \ft synecdoche \f* to loyally serve [IDI] him, to conduct our lives as he wants us to, and to obey all
his commandments and statutes and laws \f + \ft doublet \f* that he gave to our ancestors.
\v 59 I pray that Yahweh our God will never forget these words that I have prayed, pleading for his help; I pray that he will
think about them by day and by night. I pray that he will always act mercifully toward us Israeli people and toward our king,
giving us the things that we need day by day. 
\v 60 If you do that, all the people-groups in the world will know that you, Yahweh, are the only one who is God, and that
there is no other one who is God. 
\v 61 I pray that you, \add his people\add*, will always be fully committed\f + \ft Or: dedicated \f* to Yahweh, and that you will obey all his
statutes and commands, like you are doing now." 
\s Solomon dedicated the temple 
\p
\v 62 Then the king and all the Israeli people who were there offered sacrifices to Yahweh.
\v 63 They sacrificed 22,000 cattle and 120,000 sheep to restore fellowship with Yahweh. Then the king and all the people
dedicated the temple. 
\p
\v 64 On that day, the king also dedicated\f + \ft Or: set apart \f* the middle part of the courtyard that was in front of the temple. Then
he offered there sacrifices that would be completely burned \add on the
altar\add*, the offerings of grain and the fat of the animals that were sacrificed to restore fellowship with Yahweh. They
sacrificed them there because the bronze altar was not big enough for all those sacrifices to be burned on it
\add that day\add*. 
\p
\v 65 Then Solomon and all the Israeli people celebrated the Festival of
\add Living in Temporary\add* Shelters for seven days. There was a huge crowd of people there, some of whom had come from
\add distant places like\add* Hamath \add in the far north\add* and the border of Egypt
\add in the far south\add*. 
\v 66 On the eighth day, Solomon sent the people to their homes. They all praised him and went home happy because of all the
things that Yahweh had done to bless David and his Israeli people.
