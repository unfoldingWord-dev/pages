\c 9  
\s What Yahweh replied to Solomon's prayer 
\p
\v 1 After Solomon's \add workers\add* had finished building the temple and his palace and everything else that Solomon wanted
them to build, 
\v 2 Yahweh appeared to him \add in a dream\add* a second time, like he had appeared to him at Gibeon
\add city\add*. 
\v 3 Yahweh said to him, 
\pi “I heard what you prayed and what you pleaded for me to do. I have ◄dedicated/set apart► this temple which your
\add workers\add* have built to be the place where people will worship me [MTY] forever. I [SYN] will always watch over it and
protect [DOU] it. 
\pi
\v 4 And as for you, if you conduct your life as I want you to, like your father David did, and if you very sincerely [DOU]
obey all the statutes and laws [DOU] that I have commanded you to obey,
\v 5 I will do what I promised your father that I would do: I promised him that Israel would always be [LIT] ruled by his
descendants. 
\pi
\v 6 But if you or your descendants turn away from me and disobey the commands and decrees [DOU] that I have given to you, and
if you start to worship other gods, 
\v 7 I will remove my Israeli people from the land that I have given to them. I will also abandon this temple that I have
◄dedicated/set apart► to be the place where people should worship me [MTY]. Then people everywhere will despise Israel and make
fun of it. 
\v 8 This temple will become a heap of ruins. Everyone who passes by will be astonished
\add when they see it\add*, and they will hiss/whistle and say, ‘Why has Yahweh done this to this land and to this temple?’
\v 9 And other people will reply, ‘It happened because the Israeli people abandoned Yahweh their God, the one who brought their
ancestors out of Egypt. They started to accept and worship other gods. And that is why Yahweh has caused them to experience all
these disasters.’ ” 
\s Other things that Solomon did 
\p
\v 10 Solomon's \add workers\add* worked for twenty years to build the temple and the palace.
\v 11 Hiram, the king of Tyre \add city\add* had \add arranged for his workers
to\add* give Solomon all the cedar and pine \add logs\add* and all the gold that he needed
\add for this work\add*. After it was all finished, King Solomon gave to Hiram twenty cities in the Galilee region.
\v 12 But when Hiram went from Tyre \add to Galilee\add* to see the cities that Solomon had given to him, he was not pleased
with them. 
\v 13 He said to Solomon, “My friend, those cities that you gave me are lousy/worthless cities!” [RHQ] Because of that, that
area is still called 'Worthless.' 
\v 14 Hiram gave Solomon only five tons of gold \add for those cities\add*.
\p
\v 15 This is a record of the work that King Solomon forced men to do. He forced them to build the temple and his palace and
the landfill/terraces \add on the east side of the city\add*, and the wall around Jerusalem, and
\add to rebuild\add* Hazor and Megiddo and Gezer \add cities\add*.
\v 16  \add The reason they needed to rebuild Gezer was that the army
of\add* the king of Egypt had attacked Gezer and captured it. Then they had burned
\add the houses in\add* the city and killed all the people of the Canaan people-group who lived there. The king of Egypt gave
that city to his daughter for a gift/present when she married Solomon.
\v 17 So Solomon's workers also rebuilt Gezer, and they also rebuilt Lower Beth-Horon
\add city\add*. 
\v 18 They also rebuilt Baalath and Tamar \add towns\add* in the desert in the
\add southern part of\add* Judah. 
\v 19 They also built the cities where they kept the supplies for Solomon, the places where his horses and chariots were kept.
They also built everything else that he wanted them to build, in Jerusalem and in Lebanon, and in other places in the area over
which he ruled. 
\p
\v 20 There were many people who belonged to the Amor people-group, the Heth people-group, the Periz people-group, the Hiv
people-group, and the Jebus people-group who were not killed when the Israelis captured their land.
\v 21  \add Their descendants still lived in Israel\add*. It was those people whom Solomon forced to become his slaves
\add to build all those places\add*, and they are still slaves. 
\v 22 But Solomon did not force any Israeli people to become slaves. Some of them became soldiers and army officers and
commanders and drivers of his chariots and men/soldiers who rode on horses.
\v 23 There were 550 officials who supervised the slaves who worked
\add to build all those places\add*. 
\p
\v 24 After \add Solomon's wife, who was\add* the daughter of the king of Egypt, moved from
\add the place outside Jerusalem called\add* the City of David to the palace that Solomon's workers built for her, Solomon
\add told his workers to\add* fill in the land on the east side of the city.
\p
\v 25 Three times each year Solomon \add brought to the temple\add* offerings that were completely burned
\add on the altar\add* and offerings to restore fellowship with Yahweh. He also brought incense to be burned in the presence of
Yahweh. 
\p And that is how his men finished building the temple. 
\p
\v 26 King Solomon's \add workers\add* also built a fleet of ships at Ezion-Geber
\add city\add*, which is near Elath \add city\add*, on the shore of the Gulf of Aqaba, in the land belonging to the Edom
people-group. 
\v 27  \add King\add* Hiram sent some very expert sailors to go/serve/work on the ships with Solomon's workers.
\v 28 They sailed to the Ophir \add region\add* and brought back to Solomon about sixteen tons of gold.
