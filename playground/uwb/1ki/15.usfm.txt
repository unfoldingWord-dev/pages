\s King Abijah of Judah 
\p
\v 1 After Jeroboam had been the king of Israel for almost eighteen years, Abijah became the king of Judah.
\v 2 He ruled for three years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Maacah, the granddaughter of
\add David's son\add* Absalom. 
\p
\v 3 Abijah committed the same kind of sins that his father had committed. He was not fully dedicated\f + \ft Or: committed \f* to Yahweh his
God, as his grandfather David had been. 
\v 4 But, because of what Yahweh his God \add had promised to David\add*, Yahweh gave Abijah a son \f + \ft metaphor \f* to rule in Jerusalem
after him, and in order to protect Jerusalem \add from their enemies\add*.
\v 5 Yahweh did that because David had always done what pleased Yahweh and because David had always obeyed Yahweh. The only
time when he disobeyed Yahweh was when he caused Uriah \add to be
killed\add*. 
\p
\v 6 There were wars between \add the armies of\add* Rehoboam and Jeroboam all during the time that Abijah ruled.
\v 7 Everything else that Abijah did is written \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* in the book named 'The History of the Kings of Judah.'
\v 8 Abijah died \f + \ft euphemism \f* and was buried in \add the part of Jerusalem
called\add* 'the City of David,' and his son Asa became king. 
\s King Asa of Judah 
\p
\v 9 After Jeroboam had been the king of Israel for almost twenty years, Asa started to rule Judah.
\v 10 He ruled in Jerusalem for 41 years. His grandmother was Maacah, the granddaughter of Absalom.
\p
\v 11 Asa did what was pleasing to Yahweh, as his ancestor David had done.
\v 12 He got rid of the male prostitutes that were at the places where the people worshiped idols, and he also got rid of all
the idols that his ancestors had made. 
\v 13 He also removed his grandmother Maacah so that she no longer
\add had influence in the government because of\add* being the mother of a previous king. He did that because she had made a
disgusting \add wooden\add* statue of the goddess Asherah. Asa told his workers to cut down the statue and burned it in the
Kidron Valley. 
\v 14 He was not able to destroy all the places where the people worshiped
\add Yahweh\add* on the high hills, but he continued to be dedicated\f + \ft Or: committed \f* to Yahweh all during the time that he lived.
\v 15 He told his workers to place in the temple all the items that his father had dedicated to God, and all the gold and
silver things that he had dedicated to God. 
\p
\v 16 There were wars between \add the armies of\add* Asa and Baasha, the king of Israel, all during the time that they ruled.
\v 17 Baasha's army invaded Judah. They captured Ramah \add town north of
Jerusalem\add*. Then they started to build a wall around it in order to prevent people from entering or leaving the area in
Judah that was ruled by King Asa. 
\p
\v 18 So Asa \add told his workers to\add* take all the silver and gold that was still in the storerooms in the temple and in
the palace and gave it to some of his officials. He told them to take it to Damascus and give it to King Ben-Hadad who ruled
Syria. Ben-Hadad was the son of Tabrimmon and grandson of Hezion. He told the officials to say this to Ben-Hadad:
\v 19 “I want there to be a peace treaty between me and you, like there was between my father and your father. For that
purpose, I am giving you this silver and gold. So now please cancel the treaty that you made with Baasha, the king of Israel,
in order that he will take his soldiers away from attacking mine,
\add because he will be afraid of your army\add*.” 
\v 20  \add So the officials went and gave the message to Ben-Hadad,
and\add* he did what Asa suggested. He sent his army commanders \add and their
soldiers\add* to attack some of the towns in Israel. They captured Ijon, Dan, Abel-Beth-Maacah, the area near Galilee Lake, and
all the land of the tribe of Naphtali. 
\v 21 When Baasha heard about that, he \add told his soldiers to\add* stop working at Ramah. He
\add and his soldiers returned to\add* Tirzah and stayed there. 
\v 22 Then King Asa sent a message to all the \add people in the\add* towns in Judah, stating that they all were required to go
to Ramah and carry away the stones and timber that Baasha's soldiers had been using to build a wall around the city. With those
stones and timber they fortified Mizpah \add city north of Jerusalem\add*, and Geba,
\add a town\add* in the territory of the tribe of Benjamin. 
\p
\v 23 Everything else that Asa did, the armies that his soldiers defeated, and the names of the cities that he caused to be
fortified, are \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* all written in the book named 'The History of the Kings of Judah.' But when Asa became old, he got a
disease in his feet. 
\v 24 He died \f + \ft euphemism \f* and was buried where his ancestors were buried in
\add the part of Jerusalem called\add* 'the City of David.' Then his son Jehoshaphat became king.
\s King Nadab of Israel 
\p
\v 25 After Asa had been the king of Judah for almost two years, King Jeroboam's son Nadab started to rule Israel. He ruled for
two years. 
\v 26 He did things that Yahweh said were evil. His behavior was sinful like his father's behavior had been, and what he did
induced the people of Israel to sin. 
\p
\v 27  \add A man named\add* Baasha, from the tribe of Issachar, planned to harm him. He killed Nadab when Nadab and his army
had surrounded Gibbethon \add city\add* in the Philistia area. 
\v 28 That \f + \ft doublet \f* was when Asa had been \add the king ruling\add* Judah for almost three years. Then Baasha became the king of
Israel. 
\p
\v 29 As soon as he became king, \add he commanded his soldiers\add* to kill all of Jeroboam's family. Doing what Yahweh had
told the prophet Ahijah from Shiloh would happen, they killed all of Jeroboam's family. None of them was left\f + \ft Or: remained alive \f*.
\v 30 That happened because Yahweh had become very angry with Jeroboam because of all the sins that Jeroboam had committed, and
because of the sins that he had persuaded the people of Israel to commit.
\p
\v 31 Everything else that Nadab did is written \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* in the book named 'The History of the Kings of Israel.'
\v 32 There were wars between \add the armies of\add* King Asa and King Baasha all the time that they ruled.
\s King Baasha of Israel 
\p
\v 33 After Asa had been the king of Judah for almost three years, Baasha, the son of Ahijah, started to rule Israel at Tirzah
\add city\add*. He ruled for 24 years. 
\v 34 He did things that Yahweh said were evil, and his behavior was sinful like his father's had been, and he induced the
people of Israel to sin.
