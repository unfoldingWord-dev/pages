\s What Nebuchadnezzar dreamed 
\p
\v 1 One night during the second year that Nebuchadnezzar ruled, he had a dream. The dream worried him very much; and as a
result he could not sleep. 
\v 2  \add The next morning\add* he summoned his men who worked magic, fortune-tellers, those who worked sorcery, and those who
studied the stars. \add Although he had forgotten what he had dreamed\add*, he insisted that they tell him what he had dreamed.
As they stood there in front of the king, 
\v 3 he said, “I had a dream \add last night\add* that worries me. Tell me what I dreamed, because I want to know what the
dream means.” 
\p
\v 4 The men who studied the stars replied to the king, speaking in the Aramaic language. They said, “King Nebuchadnezzar, we
hope that you will live a long time! Tell us what you dreamed, and then we will tell you what it means!”
\p
\v 5 But the king replied to them, “I have firmly decided that you must tell me the dream, and also tell me what it means. If
you do not do that, I will \add order my soldiers to\add* cut you into pieces, and to cause your houses to become only piles of
stones! 
\v 6 But if you tell me what I dreamed and what it means, I will reward you. I will give you wonderful gifts and greatly honor
you. So tell me what I dreamed and what it means!” 
\p
\v 7 But again they replied, “Tell us what you dreamed, and then we will tell you what it means.”
\p
\v 8 The king replied, “I know that you are just trying to get more time, because you know that I will do to you what I said
that I would do. 
\v 9 If you do not tell me what I dreamed, you will be punished.
\add I think\add* that you have all agreed to tell me lies and other wicked things, because you hope that I will change
◄\add my mind/what I am thinking\add*►. But tell me the dream, and then I will know that you can also tell me what it means.”
\p
\v 10 The men who studied the stars replied to the king, “There is no one on the earth who can do what you ask! There is no
king, even a great and mighty king, who has ever asked his men who work magic or his fortune-tellers or men who study the stars
to do something like that! 
\v 11 What you are asking us to do is impossible. Only the gods can tell you what you dreamed, and they do not live among us!”
\p
\v 12 The king was very angry when he heard that, so he commanded
\add his soldiers\add* that they execute all such wise men in Babylon.
\v 13 And because of what the king commanded, they sent some men to find me and my three friends, to execute us also.
\p
\v 14 Arioch, the commander of the king's guards, came to kill us. But I spoke to him very wisely and tactfully/skillfully.
\v 15 I asked Arioch, “Why has the king made such a harsh/terrible decree?” So Arioch told me all that had happened
\add because of the king's dream\add*. 
\v 16 I immediately went to talk to the king and requested that the king give me some time, so that I could find out
\add what the dream was and\add* what the dream meant. 
\p
\v 17 Then I went home, and I told my friends, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, what had happened.
\v 18 I urged them to ask God, who lives/rules in heaven, to act mercifully toward us by telling us the secret
\add meaning of what the king dreamed\add*, in order that we and the other wise men in Babylon would not be executed.
\v 19 And that night \add God\add* gave to me a vision in which he revealed the secret. Then I praised God,
\v 20 saying, 
\q “We should praise God [MTY] forever, 
\q2 because only he truly is wise and powerful. 
\q
\v 21 He determines what events will happen through the years. 
\q2 He removes some kings and gives their authority to new kings.
\q He is the one who causes people to become wise 
\q2 and enables those who study to understand many things. 
\q
\v 22 He reveals things that are very mysterious; 
\q2 he is surrounded by light 
\q2 but he knows things that are hidden \add as though they were\add* in the darkness.
\q
\v 23 God, whom my ancestors \add worshiped\add*, 
\q I thank you and I praise you, 
\q2 because you have caused me to be wise and made me strong. 
\q2 You have told me what my friends and I asked you to tell us;
\q2 and you have revealed to us what the king demanded to know.”
\s Daniel told the meaning of the dream 
\p
\v 24 Then I went to Arioch, the man whom the king had appointed to execute the wise men in Babylon. I said to him, “Do not
kill those wise men. Take me to the king, and I will tell him what his dream means.”
\p
\v 25 So Arioch quickly took me to the king. He said to the king, “I have found one of the men whom we brought from Judah who
can tell you what your dream means!” 
\p
\v 26 The king said to me, whose new name was Belteshazzar, “Is this true? Can you tell me what I dreamed and what it means?”
\p
\v 27 I replied, “There are no wise men or fortune-tellers or men who work magic or men who work sorcery who can tell such
things to you. 
\v 28 But there is a God in heaven who reveals secrets. And he has shown in
\add your dream\add* what will happen in the future. Now I will tell you what you dreamed, and the vision you saw
\add as you were lying\add* on your bed. 
\p
\v 29 O King, while you were sleeping, you dreamed about events that will happen in the future. The one who reveals mysteries
has shown you what is going to happen. 
\v 30 And it is not because I am wiser than anyone else on earth that I know the meaning of this mysterious dream. It is
because God wanted you to understand what you were thinking. 
\p
\v 31 O King, in your vision you saw in front of you a huge and terrifying statue of a man. It was shining very brightly, and
it was frightening and awesome. 
\v 32 The head of the statue was made of pure gold. Its chest and arms were made of silver. Its belly and thighs were made of
bronze. 
\v 33 Its legs were made of iron, and its feet were a mixture of clay and iron.
\v 34 As you watched, something cut a rock \add from a mountain\add*, but it was not a human who cut it. The rock
\add tumbled down and\add* smashed the feet of the statue that were made of iron and clay. It smashed them to bits.
\v 35 Then the rest of the statue collapsed into a big heap of iron, clay, bronze, silver, and gold. The pieces of the statue
were as small as bits of chaff on the ground where it is threshed, and the wind blew away all the tiny pieces. There was
nothing left. But the rock that smashed the statue became a large mountain that covered the whole earth.
\p
\v 36 That was what you dreamed. Now I will tell you what it means.
\v 37 You are a king who rules over many other kings. The God who rules in heaven has caused you to rule over them and has
given you great power [DOU] and has honored you. 
\v 38 He has caused you to be the ruler over all people, and even the animals and birds are controlled by you. So the head
\add of the statue\add* represents you. 
\p
\v 39 But after your kingdom/rule ends, there will be another great kingdom, but it will not be as great as yours.
\add The silver parts of the statue represent that kingdom\add*. Then there will be a third great kingdom
\add whose king\add* will rule over the whole earth. The bronze parts
\add of the statue represent\add* that kingdom. 
\v 40 After that kingdom ends, there will be a fourth great kingdom. The iron
\add parts of the statue represent that kingdom\add*. \add The army
of\add* that kingdom will smash the previous kingdoms, just like iron smashes everything that it strikes.
\v 41 The feet and toes of the statue that you saw, that were a mixture of iron and clay, indicate that the kingdom they
represent will later be divided. 
\v 42 Some parts of that kingdom will be as strong as iron, but some parts will not remain together, just as iron an clay do
not stay together. 
\v 43 The mixture of iron and clay \add in the statue\add* shows also that the rulers of those kingdoms that separate from each
other will try to form alliances with each other as a result of members of the royal families of these kingdoms marrying each
other. But that will not succeed, just as iron and clay do not stick together.
\p
\v 44 But while those kings are ruling, God who rules in heaven will establish a kingdom that will never end. No one will ever
defeat its king. He will completely destroy all those kingdoms, but his kingdom will remain forever.
\v 45 That is the meaning of the rock that something cut from the mountain, the rock that will crush to tiny bits the statue
that is made of iron, bronze, silver, and gold.” 
\s Daniel was made the chief advisor 
\p
\v 46 Then King Nebuchadnezzar prostrated himself in front of me
\add in great respect\add*. He commanded his people that they burn incense and burn an offering of grain to honor me.
\v 47 The king said to me, “\add Your God has enabled\add* you to tell me the meaning of this dream/mystery, so now I truly
know that your God is greater than all the other gods and all other kings. He reveals to people things that they cannot know.”
\p
\v 48 Then the king gave many gifts to me, and he also appointed me to rule over the entire province of Babylon, and also to be
the boss of all his wise men. 
\v 49 I asked the king to appoint Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego to also have important positions in Babylon province, and the
king did what I asked him to do. But I did my work while I stayed at the king's palace.
