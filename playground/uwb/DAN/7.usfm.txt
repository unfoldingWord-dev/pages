\c 7  
\s Daniel dreamed about four beasts 
\p
\v 1  \add Previously\add*, during the first year that Belshazzar was the king of Babylonia, I had a dream and a vision one
night as I lay on my bed. \add The next morning\add* I wrote down what I had dreamed. This is what I wrote:
\p
\v 2 I, Daniel, had a vision during the night. In the vision I saw that strong winds were blowing from all four directions,
stirring up \add the water in\add* the ocean. 
\v 3 Then \add I saw\add* four beasts coming out of the ocean. All four of them were different.
\p
\v 4 The first one resembled a lion, but it had wings like an eagle has. But as I watched, something tore off its wings {its
wings were pulled off}. The beast was left there, standing on its two hind/rear legs, like a human being stands. And it was
given a mind like humans have. 
\p
\v 5 The second beast resembled a bear. It was crouching, and it held between its teeth three ribs
\add from another animal that it had killed and eaten\add*. Someone said to it {It was told}, “Stand up and eat as much meat as
you want!” 
\p
\v 6 Then I saw in front of me the third of these beasts. It resembled a leopard, but it had four wings protruding from its
back. The wings were like a bird's wings. It had four heads. It was given the power/authority to rule
\add people\add*. 
\p
\v 7 In the vision I saw a fourth beast. It was stronger than the other beasts, and it was more terrifying. It crushed other
creatures with its huge iron teeth and ate their flesh. The parts of animals that it did not grind with its teeth, it trampled
\add on the ground\add*. It was different from the other three beasts: it had ten horns
\add on its head\add*. 
\p
\v 8 While I was looking at those horns, I saw a little horn appear
\add on the head of that beast\add*. It tore out three of the other horns. This little horn had eyes like humans have, and it
had a mouth \add with which it spoke\add* very boastfully. 
\p
\v 9 Then while I watched, 
\q thrones were put in the places \add where they belonged\add*,
\q2 and \add God\add*, the one who had been living forever, sat on one of the thrones.
\q His clothes were as white as snow, 
\q2 and his hair was as white as pure/clean wool. 
\q His throne had wheels that were blazing with fire, 
\q2 and his throne was also blazing. 
\q
\v 10 A fire was rushing out of in front of him like a stream. 
\q Many thousands \add of people\add* (OR, angels) were there serving him,
\q2 and millions \add of other people\add* (OR, angels) were standing in front of him.
\q They started ◄the court session/judging people►, 
\q2 and they opened the books \add in which they had written the record of all the good and bad things that people had
done\add*. 
\p
\v 11 While I was watching, I could hear the little horn speaking very boastfully. As I continued to watch, the fourth beast
was killed. Its corpse was thrown into a fire and completely burned.
\v 12 The power/authority of the other three beasts was taken away from them, but they were allowed to continue to live for a
while. 
\p
\v 13 While I \add continued to\add* see the vision that night, I saw someone who resembled a human being. He was coming
\add closer to me\add*, surrounded by clouds. Then he was taken to
\add God\add*, the one who had been living forever. 
\v 14 He was honored and given great authority to rule over all the nations in the world, in order that people from every
people-group and every nation, people from all language groups, would worship/serve him. He will rule forever; he will never
stop ruling. The kingdom that he rules will never be destroyed. 
\s The explanation of the vision 
\p
\v 15 As for me, Daniel, I was very terrified by what I had seen in that vision, and I did not know what to think about it.
\v 16 I went to one of those who were standing there, and I asked him to tell me what it meant. So he told me the meaning of
it. 
\p
\v 17  \add He said\add*, “The four huge beasts represent four kingdoms/empires that will exist on the earth.
\v 18 But the Supreme God will give power/authority to his people
\add to rule\add*, and they shall rule forever.” 
\p
\v 19 Then I wanted to know what the fourth beast signified—the beast that was different from the other three, the beast that
crushed those that it attacked with its bronze claws, and then ate their flesh with its iron teeth, and trampled on the parts
of their bodies \add that it did not eat\add*. 
\v 20  \add I also wanted to know about\add* the ten horns on its head, and about the horn that appeared later, which got rid
of three of the other horns. \add I wanted to know what it meant
that\add* it had eyes and a mouth with which it spoke very boastfully, and that was more terrifying than the other beasts.
\v 21 While I was having the vision, I saw that this horn attacked God's people and was defeating them.
\v 22 But then the Supreme God, the one who had been living forever, came and judged in favor of the people who belonged to
him. And \add I knew that\add* it was time for God's people to receive authority
\add to rule\add*. 
\p
\v 23 Then the man who was standing there said to me, “The fourth beast represents an empire that will exist on the earth; that
empire will be different from all other empires. \add The army of\add* that empire will crush/kill
\add people all over\add* the world and trample \add on their bodies\add*.
\v 24 As for its ten horns, they represent ten kings who will rule that empire,
\add one after the other\add*. Then another king will appear. He will be different from the previous kings. He will defeat the
three kings \add that were represented by the three horns that were pulled
out\add*. 
\v 25 He will rebuke the Supreme God, and he will oppress God's people. He will try to change the sacred festivals and their
religious laws/regulations. He will control them for three and a half years.
\p
\v 26 But there will be a session/meeting of the court/judges in heaven, and that king's authority/power will be taken away,
and he will be completely destroyed. 
\v 27 Then all the power and the greatness of all the kingdoms on the earth will be given to the people who belong to the
Supreme God. The kingdom that he rules (OR, they rule) will endure forever. And the rulers of all the nations on the earth will
serve and obey him (OR, them).” 
\p
\v 28 That is \add what I saw in\add* my vision/dream. I, Daniel, was terrified, with the result that my face became pale. But
I did not tell anyone about the vision \add that I had seen\add*.
