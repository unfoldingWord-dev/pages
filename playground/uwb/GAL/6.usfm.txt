\c 6  
\s Galatians 6:1-6 
\s Gently correct anyone among you who is sinning, and help each other without thinking you are better than others.
\p
\v 1 My fellow believers, if \add you\add* discover that a person
\add among your congregation\add* is sinning, \add those of\add* you whom
\add God's\add* Spirit \add is directing and empowering\add* should gently correct that person.
\add Furthermore, each of\add* you \add who corrects another person
should\add* be very cautious in order that you might not \add sin like that
when\add* you are tempted {\add when something\add* tempts you}.
\v 2  \add When there are ones who have\add* problems, you should help each other. By doing that, you will complete what Christ
requires. 
\v 3 Keep in mind that those who \add refuse to help others because they think that they are more important than other people,
although they are\add* not really more important, are deceiving themselves.
\v 4 Instead, each \add of you\add* should \add constantly\add* test/judge
\add and decide if you can approve what you yourself are doing and
thinking\add*. Then you can boast because of what you yourself \add are doing and
thinking\add*, and not because what you are doing is superior to what other persons
\add are doing\add*. 
\v 5 Keep in mind that you must each perform your own \add individual\add* tasks.
\v 6  \add You\add* who are being taught {whom others are teaching}
\add God's truth\add* should share your various \add material\add* things [EUP] with your teachers.
\s Galatians 6:7-10 
\s We should not tire of doing good, but instead, we should do good to everyone, especially to believers.
\p
\v 7 You should not deceive yourselves. \add Remember that\add* God is never outwitted {no one ever fools God}.
\add Just like\add* a farmer will reap exactly the kind \add of crop
that\add* he plants [MET], \add God will reward people according to what they have
done\add* [MET]. 
\v 8  \add God\add* will punish eternally those who do what their self-directed natures urge them to do. But those who please
\add God's\add* Spirit will live forever \add with God\add* because of what
\add God's\add* Spirit does for them. 
\v 9 But we should not ◄tire of/become discouraged while► doing what pleases God, because
\add eventually\add*, at the time \add that God\add* has determined, we will receive a reward [MET], if we do not stop
\add doing the good things that we have been doing\add*. 
\v 10 So, whenever we have opportunities, we should do \add what
is\add* good to all people. But especially we should do what is good to all our fellow believers.
\s Galatians 6:11-16 
\s Some people want you to be circumcised only so that they will not be persecuted for proclaiming what Christ accomplished for
us on the cross, but that is the only thing that I will boast about.
\p
\v 11 I am now writing this last part of this letter to you in my own handwriting. Notice the large letters with which I am now
writing. I am doing this in order that I might emphasize this: 
\v 12 Some Jewish believers are trying to force you to perform certain rituals so that other Jews will think highly of them.
They are insisting that you be circumcised {that someone must circumcise you}. They are doing that only in order that other
Jews would no longer ◄persecute them/cause them to suffer► for proclaiming that God will save us because of our trusting in
what Christ accomplished when he died on the cross [MTY, MET]. 
\v 13 The reason that I say that is that the ones who are insisting that you be circumcised {that someone circumcise you} do
not themselves fully obey the laws that God gave to Moses. Instead, they desire that you let someone circumcise you in order
that they might boast to those Jews who would ◄persecute them/cause them to suffer► that you did that because they insisted
[MTY] that you do it. 
\v 14 I myself, however, strongly desire that I never boast about anything like that. The only thing I will boast about is what
our Lord Jesus Christ accomplished by dying on the cross [MTY]. Because of what Christ did on the cross, I no longer am
interested in the things that those who do not trust Christ [MTY] think are important, and those people are no longer
interested in the things that I [MET] think are important. 
\v 15 I will boast about Christ dying on the cross because God is concerned neither that people are circumcised nor that people
are not circumcised. Instead, he is concerned only that people conduct their lives in a completely new way.
\v 16 I pray that God will give inner peace and act kindly towards all who will act according to this new way of life. It is
all those who live according to this new way of life who are now truly God's people [MET], as the Israelite people were God's
people previously. 
\s Galatians 6:17 
\s I have suffered enough for declaring the truth about Jesus, so do not trouble me again.
\p
\v 17 Finally, I say that people have persecuted me/caused me to suffer for declaring the truth about Jesus, and as a result I
have scars on my body. Your new teachers do not have scars like mine! So do not trouble/bother me about these matters again!
\s Galatians 6:18 
\s I pray that God may act kindly within you. 
\p
\v 18 My fellow believers, I pray that our Lord Jesus Christ will kindly accomplish what he desires within you. ◄Amen!/May it
be so!►
