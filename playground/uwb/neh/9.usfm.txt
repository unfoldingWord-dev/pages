\c 9  
\s The people confessed their sins 
\p
\v 1 On October 31, the people gathered together again. They ◄fasted\f + \ft Or: abstained \f* from eating food►, they wore clothes made from
rough cloth, and they put dirt on their heads \add to show that they were sorry for their
sins\add*. 
\v 2 The Israeli people separated themselves from all the foreigners. They stood there and confessed their sins and the sins
that their ancestors had committed. 
\v 3 The scroll that contained the laws of Yahweh, the God whom they
\add worshiped\add*, was read to them for three hours. Then for three more hours they confessed their sins and they worshiped
Yahweh. 
\v 4 Some of the Levites were standing on the stairs. They were Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah,
\add another\add* Bani, and Kenani. 
\v 5 Then \add the leaders of\add* the Levites called out to the people. They were Jeshua, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah,
Hodiah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah. They said, “While you are standing there, praise Yahweh your God, who has always lived and
will live forever!” 
\p \add Then one of them continued by praying to God\add*, 
\pi “Yahweh, we praise your glorious name! You are much greater than anything that we can think about or talk about!
\pi
\v 6 You only are God. You made the sky and the heavens and all the stars. You made the earth and everything that is on it, and
you made the seas\f + \ft Or: oceans \f* and everything that is in them. You are the one who gives life to everything and helps them remain
alive. All the angels who are in heaven worship you. 
\pi
\v 7 Yahweh, you are God. You chose Abram and brought him out of Ur
\add city\add* in Chaldea \add region\add*. You gave him a new name, Abraham.
\v 8 You saw that he was trustworthy. Then you made ◄an agreement with\f + \ft Or: a \f* promise to► him, saying that you would give
\add to him and\add* to his descendants the land that the descendants of Canaan, Heth, Amor, Periz, Jebus, and Girgash lived
in. And you have done what you promised, because you always do what is right.
\pi
\v 9 You saw what our ancestors were suffering in Egypt. You heard them cry to you for help when they were at the Red Sea.
\v 10 Because you knew that the leaders of Egypt were treating our ancestors very arrogantly, you performed many kinds of
miracles that caused the king and his officials and all his people to suffer. As a result, you became famous then, and you are
still famous! 
\v 11 You caused the Red Sea to divide, with the result that your people walked through it on the ground without
\add getting their feet\add* wet. \add After they were all safely on the other
side\add*, you \add caused the water to come back again\add*, and you hurled into the deep water the
\add soldiers of the Egyptian army\add* that were pursuing our ancestors. Their soldiers sank into the deep sea like stones!
\v 12 During each day you led our ancestors with a bright cloud that resembled a huge pillar, and each night you led them by a
flaming cloud that gave them light to show them where to walk. 
\pi
\v 13 When our ancestors were at Sinai Mountain, you came down from heaven and spoke to them. You gave them many regulations
and instructions that are just and reliable, and you gave them commands and laws that are good.
\v 14 You taught them about your holy ◄Sabbath\f + \ft Or: day \f* of rest►, and you gave many kinds of laws to your servant Moses for him to
tell to the people. 
\v 15 When they were hungry, you gave them manna \add food\add* from the sky; and when they were thirsty, you gave them water
from a rock. You commanded them to go and take, from the people who lived there, the land which you had solemnly promised to
give to them. 
\pi
\v 16 But our ancestors were very proud and stubborn [IDI], and they did not obey what you commanded them to do.
\v 17 They refused to heed you, and they forgot about all the miracles that you had performed for them. Instead, they became
stubborn [IDI], and they appointed someone to lead them back to Egypt, where they would be slaves again! But you are a God who
forgives us and who acts kindly and mercifully \add toward us\add*. You do not quickly become angry. You are always faithfully
loving us. 
\v 18 So, even though \add their leaders\add* made an idol that resembled a calf and insulted you by saying
\add about the idol\add*, ‘This is your god, who brought you up out of Egypt,’ you did not desert them.
\pi
\v 19 Because you always act mercifully, you did not abandon them when they were in the desert. The bright cloud which was like
a huge pillar continued to lead them during the daytime, and the fiery cloud showed them where to walk at night.
\v 20 You sent your good Spirit to instruct them. You continued to provide water when they were thirsty.
\v 21 For forty years you took care of them in the desert. During all that time, they did not lack anything
\add that they needed\add*. Their clothes did not wear out, and their feet did not swell up
\add even though they were continually walking\add*. 
\pi
\v 22 You helped our ancestors to defeat armies of great kings who ruled many people-groups. By doing that, you enabled our
ancestors to ◄occupy\f + \ft Or: live \f* in► even the most distant places in this land. They occupied the land over which King Sihon ruled
from Heshbon \add city\add* and the land over which King Og ruled in the Bashan
\add area\add*. 
\v 23 You caused our ancestors' descendants to become as numerous as the stars in the sky, and you brought them into this land,
the land that you told their fathers to enter and occupy. 
\v 24 Their sons went in and took the land \add from the people that lived
there\add*. You enabled them to defeat the descendants of Canaan who lived here in this land. You enabled them to conquer the
descendants of Canaan and their kings and the people whom they ruled. You enabled our ancestors to do to those people whatever
they wanted to do. 
\v 25 Our ancestors captured cities that had walls around them, and they took possession of fertile land. They took possession
of houses that were full of good things, where there were wells that were already dug. They took possession of many vineyards
and groves of olive trees and fruit trees. They ate all that they wanted to and became fat. They were delighted in all these
good things that you gave to them. 
\pi
\v 26 But they disobeyed you and rebelled against you. They ◄turned their backs on\f + \ft Or: rejected \f*► your laws. They killed the
prophets who warned them that they should return to you. They badly insulted you.
\v 27 So you allowed their enemies to defeat them. But when their enemies caused them to suffer, they called out to you. You
heard them from heaven, and because you are very merciful, you sent them people to help them, and those leaders rescued them
from their enemies. 
\pi
\v 28 But after there was a time of peace again, our ancestors again did things that displeased you. So again you allowed their
enemies to conquer them. But whenever they cried out to you again
\add to help them\add*, you heard them from heaven, and because you act mercifully, you rescued them many times.
\pi
\v 29 You warned them that they should again \add obey\add* your laws, but they became proud and stubborn, and they disobeyed
your commands. They sinned by disobeying what you commanded them to do, the things that would enable them to live a good long
life \add if they obeyed them\add*. They stubbornly refused [IDI] to listen to you and continued sinning.
\v 30 You were patient with them for many years. You warned them by
\add the messages\add* your Spirit gave to the prophets. But they did not ◄heed\f + \ft Or: pay \f* attention to► those messages. So again you
allowed \add the armies of\add* other nations to defeat them. 
\v 31 But because you act very mercifully, you did not get rid of them completely or abandon them
\add forever\add*. You are a very gracious\f + \ft Or: kind \f* and merciful God!
\pi
\v 32 Our God, you are great! You are mighty! You are awesome! You faithfully love us as
\add you promised in\add* your agreement with us that you would do! But now we are experiencing great difficulties\f + \ft Or: hardships \f*.
These have happened to us, to our kings, to our \add other\add* leaders, to our priests, and to our prophets. We have been
experiencing these troubles since \add the armies of\add* the kings of Assyria
\add conquered us\add*, and we are still experiencing them. We ask that you sincerely think about \\f + \\ft litotes \\f* all these things.
\v 33  \add We know that\add* you acted justly each time that you punished us. We have sinned greatly, but you have treated us
faithfully. 
\v 34 Our kings and other leaders and our priests and our other ancestors did not obey your laws. They did not heed your
commands or the warnings that you gave to them. 
\v 35 Even when they had their own kings, and they enjoyed the good things that you did for them in this large and fertile land
that you gave to them, they did not serve you. They refused to quit doing what was evil.
\pi
\v 36 So now we are \add like\add* slaves here in this land that you gave to our ancestors, the land that you gave to them in
order that they could enjoy all the good things that grow here. 
\v 37 Because we have sinned, \add we cannot eat the things that grow
here\add*. The kings that now rule over us are enjoying the things that grow here. They rule us and
\add take\add* our cattle. We have to serve them and do the things that please them. We are in great misery\f + \ft Or: distress \f*.”
\s The people's agreement 
\p
\v 38 However, we \add Israeli\add* people now are making a solemn agreement\f + \ft Or: promise \f*
\add to obey you\add*, and we are writing this agreement\f + \ft Or: promise \f*
\add on a scroll\add*. We will write on it the names of our leaders and the names of the Levites and the names of the priests,
and then we will seal it.
