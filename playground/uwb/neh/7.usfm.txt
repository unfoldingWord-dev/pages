\v 1 After the wall had been finished and we had put the gates in their places, we assigned to the temple guards and to the
members of the \add sacred\add* choir and the other descendants of Levi the work that they were to do.
\v 2 I appointed two men to \add help me to\add* govern Jerusalem, my brother Hanani and Hananiah who was the commander of the
fortress \add in Jerusalem\add*. Hananiah always did his work reliably, and he had more awesome respect for God than most other
people have. 
\v 3 I said to them, “Do not open the gates of Jerusalem until late each morning. And close the gates and put the bars across
the doors \add ◄late in each afternoon/before sunset►\add* while the gatekeepers are still guarding the gates.” I also told
them to appoint some people who lived in Jerusalem to be guards, and to assign some of them to be guards at certain places and
to assign others to guard the area close to their own houses. 
\s A list of those who returned to Jerusalem 
\p
\v 4 The city of Jerusalem covered a large area, but \add at that
time\add* not many people lived in the city, and they had not built many new houses yet {not many new houses had been built}
\f + \fr hyperbole \f*. 
\v 5  \add To defend the city, we needed more people there\add*. Then God gave me the idea to summon the leaders and officials
and other people, and to look in the books \add in which were written the
names\add* of all the people and their clans. So I found the records of the people who had first returned from Babylonia. This
is what I found written in those records: 
\pi
\v 6 ◄This is a list/Here are the names► of the people who returned to Jerusalem and to other places in Judea. They had been
living in Babylonia since King Nebuchadnezzar's army had captured their relatives/ancestors and took them to Babylonia. But
they had returned to Judea and were living in the towns \add where their ancestors had
lived\add* 
\v 7 Their leaders were Zerubbabel, Joshua, me, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, and

\b
\pi
\v 60 Altogether, there were 392 temple workers and descendants of Solomon's servants who returned.
\b
\pi
\v 61-62 Another group of 642 people from the clans of Delaiah, Tobiah, and Nekoda returned from the towns of Tel-Melah,
Tel-Harsha, Kerub, Addan (\add who is also known as Addon\add*) \f*, and Immer
\add in Babylonia\add*. But they could not prove that they were descendants of Israelis.
\b
\pi
\v 63 Priests from the clans of Hobaiah, Hakkoz, and Barzillai also returned. Barzillai had married a woman who is a descendant
of \add a man named\add* Barzillai from the Gilead \add region\add*, and he had taken his wife's family name.
\v 64 They searched in the records that contained the names of people's ancestors, but they could not find the names of those
clans, so they were not allowed to have the rights and duties that priests have right away.
\v 65 The governor told them that first, a priest should use the marked stones
\add to find out what God said about their being priests\add*. 
\b
\pi
\v 66 Altogether, there were 42,360 people who returned to Judea.
\v 67 There were also 7337 of their servants, and 245 singers, which included men and women.
\v 68 The Israelis also brought back \add from Babylonia\add* 736 horses, 245 mules,

temple\add*. I, the governor, gave ◄17 pounds/8.6 kg.► of gold, 50 bowls

\v 72 The rest of the people gave a total of ◄337 pounds/153 kg.► of gold, ◄2923 pounds/1330 kg.► of silver, and 67 robes for

priests\add*, the temple guards, the musicians, the temple workers, and many ordinary people, who were all Israelis, started to
live in the towns and cities of Judea \add where their ancestors had
lived\add*.
