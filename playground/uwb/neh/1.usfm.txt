\s Nehemiah's prayer 
\p
\v 1  \add I am\add* Nehemiah, the son of Hacaliah. \add I am writing\add* this account
\add of what I did when I returned to Jerusalem\add*. During the twentieth year
\add after King Artaxerxes began to rule the Persian Empire\add*, near the end of that year, I was in Susa, the capital
\add of Persia\add*. 
\p
\v 2 My brother Hanani came to visit me. He and some other men had just returned from Judah. I queried them about the Jews who
were living there, whose \add parents\add* had been ◄exiled\f + \ft Or: taken \f* forcefully►
\add to Babylonia many years previously\add*. I also asked them about
\add what was happening in\add* Jerusalem. 
\p
\v 3 They said to me, “The Jews in Jerusalem who returned there from Babylonia are living in a very difficult situation. The
walls of the city have been broken down, and even the city gates have been burned down.”
\p
\v 4 When I heard that, I sat down and cried. For several days I mourned, and I ◄fasted\f + \ft Or: abstained \f* from eating food►, and I
prayed to our God, \add who is\f + \ft Or: rules \f*\add* in heaven. 
\v 5 I said, “Yahweh, you who \add are\f + \ft Or: rule \f* in\add* heaven, you are a great and awesome God. You keep your promise to
faithfully love those who love you and who obey your commands. 
\v 6 Now please look at me and listen to what I am praying. I pray during the day and at night for your Israeli people. I
confess that we Israeli people have sinned. Even I and my family have sinned against you.
\v 7 We have acted very wickedly. \add Many years ago\add* your servant Moses gave us your laws and all the things you
commanded us to do \\f + \\ft doublet \\f*, but we have not obeyed\f + \ft Or: done \f* them. 
\p
\v 8 But please remember what you told your servant Moses. You said, ‘If you sin, I will scatter you among the
◄\add heathen nations\f + \ft Or: nations \f* that do not believe in me\add*►. 
\v 9 But if you return to me and obey my commands, even if you have been exiled to very remote\f + \ft Or: distant \f* places on the earth, I
will gather you from there, and I will bring you back here \add to
Israel\add*, the land that I \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* have chosen to be honored in.’
\p
\v 10 We are your servants. We are the people whom you brought back here by your very great power [MTY, DOU]
\add from being exiled in Babylonia\add*. 
\v 11 Yahweh, please hear this prayer of mine, and the prayers of all your people who are delighted to revere you \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f*. Now I
will go to the king, to request that he do me a great favor. Please motivate him to act kindly toward me, in order that I will
be successful \add in obtaining what I want\add*.” 
\p At that time, I was the one whose work was to taste all the food and drink before it was served to the king,
\add to be sure that no one had put poison in it\add*.
