\c 13  
\s Foreigners were excluded 
\p
\v 1 On that day, when someone read to the people parts of the laws that
\add God gave to\add* Moses, they read where it was written that no one from the Ammon people-group or the Moab people-group
was ever to be allowed to be with God's people while they were gathered together
\add to worship\add*. 
\v 2 The reason for that was that the people of Ammon and the people of Moab did not give\f + \ft Or: sell \f* any food or water to the
Israelis while \add the Israelis were going through their areas after they left
Egypt\add*. Instead, the people of Ammon and Moab paid money to Balaam in order that he would curse the Israelis. But God
commanded Balaam to bless the people, not to curse them. 
\v 3 So when the people heard these laws \add being read to them\add*, they sent away all the people whose ancestors had come
from other countries. 
\s Purifying the storerooms 
\p
\v 4 Previously, Eliashib the priest had been appointed to be in charge of the storerooms in the temple. He was a relative of
\add our enemy\add* Tobiah. 
\v 5 He allowed Tobiah to use a large room in which they had previously stored the grain offerings and the incense, the
equipment that is used in the temple, the offerings \add that the people had
brought\add* for the priests, and the tithes of grain and wine and
\add olive\add* oil that \add God\add* had commanded the people to bring to the descendants of Levi, and to the temple
musicians, and to the temple guards. 
\p
\v 6 While \add Tobias was using that room\add*, I was not in Jerusalem, because in the 32nd year that Artaxerxes was the king
of Babylonia, I went back there to report to him. After a while I requested the king to allow me to return to Jerusalem,
\add and he allowed me to go\add*. 
\v 7 When I arrived in Jerusalem, I found out that Eliashib had done an evil thing by allowing Tobiah to use a room in God's
temple. 
\v 8 I became very angry, and I threw out of that room everything that belonged to Tobiah.
\v 9 Then I commanded that they \add perform a ritual to\add* make the rooms pure\f + \ft Or: acceptable to God \f* again. And I also ordered
that all the equipment used in the temple and all the grain offerings and incense should be put in that room again.
\p
\v 10 I also found out that the temple musicians and other descendants of Levi had left Jerusalem and returned to their
fields\f + \ft Or: farms \f*, because the Israeli people had not been bringing to them the food
\add that they needed\add*. 
\v 11 So I rebuked the officials, saying to them, “◄Why have you not taken care of the work in the temple?\f + \ft Or: It \f* is disgraceful
that you have not taken care of the work in the temple.►” \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* So I brought the descendants of Levi and the musicians back to
the temple, and told them to do their work again. 
\p
\v 12 Then all the people of Judah again started to bring to the temple storerooms their tithes of grain, wine, and
\add olive\add* oil. 
\v 13 I appointed these men to be in charge of the storerooms: Shelemiah, who was a priest; Zadok, who knew the Jewish laws
very well; and Pedaiah, a descendant of Levi. I appointed Hanan, who is the son of Zaccur and grandson of Mattaniah, to assist
them. I knew that I could trust these men while they distributed those offerings to their fellow workers.
\p
\v 14 My God, do not forget all these good deeds that I have faithfully done for your temple and for the work that is done
there! 
\s Other reforms instituted by Nehemiah 
\p
\v 15 During that time, I saw some people in Judea \add who were working on the Sabbath
day\add*. Some were pressing grapes \add to make wine\add*. Others were putting grain,
\add bags of\add* wine, \add baskets of\add* grapes, figs, and many \f + \ft hyperbole \f* other things, on their donkeys and taking them into
Jerusalem. I warned them that they should not sell things to the people of Judea on Sabbath days.
\v 16 I also saw some people from Tyre \add city\add* who were living there in Jerusalem who were bringing fish and other
things \add into Jerusalem\add* to sell to the people of Judea on the Sabbath day.
\v 17 So I rebuked the Jewish leaders and told them, “This is \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* a very evil thing that you are doing! You are causing the
Sabbath days to be unholy. 
\v 18 Your ancestors did \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* things like that, so God punished them, and as a result, this city was destroyed! And now by
causing the Sabbath day to be unholy, you are going to cause God to be angry with us Israeli people
\add and punish us\add* more!” 
\p
\v 19 So I commanded that at the beginning of every Sabbath day\f + \ft Or: every Friday evening \f* they should shut the gates of the city
before it became dark. I also commanded that they should not open the gates until the Sabbath day was ended
\add the next day\add*\f + \ft Or: Saturday evening \f*. Then \add each Sabbath
day\add* I put some of my men at the gates, so they would make sure that no things to sell were brought into the city on that
day. 
\v 20 One or two times merchants \f + \ft doublet \f* stayed outside of the city on Friday
night\f + \ft Or: \add the night before the Sabbath day\add* \f*. 
\v 21 I warned them, “It is useless \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* for you to stay here outside the walls
\add on Friday night\add*! If you do this again, I will clobber [IDI] you!” So after that, they did not come on Sabbath days.
\v 22 I also commanded the descendants of Levi to \add perform the ritual
to\add* purify themselves and to guard the city gates, to make sure that the Sabbath was kept holy
\add by not allowing merchants to enter it on Sabbath days\add*.
\p My God, do not forget this also that I \add have done for you\add*! And because of your faithfully loving me, allow me to
continue to live \add many more years\add*! 
\p
\v 23 During that time, I also found out that many of the Jewish men had married women from Ashdod
\add city\add*, and from the Ammon and Moab \add people-groups\add*.
\v 24 The result was that half of their children spoke the language that people in Ashdod speak or some other language, and
they didn't know how to speak our language. 
\v 25 So I rebuked those men, and I asked \add God\add* to curse them, and I pulled out
\add some of\add* their hair. Then I forced them to solemnly promise, knowing that God \f + \ft metonymy \f* was
\add listening\add*, that they would never again marry foreigners, and never allow their children to marry foreigners.
\v 26  \add I said to them\add*, “Solomon, the king of Israel, sinned \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* as a result of
\add marrying\add* foreign women. He was greater than any of the kings of other nations. God loved him, and caused him to
become the king of all the Israeli people, but his foreign wives caused even him to sin.
\v 27  \add Do you think that\add* we should do what you have done, and disobey our God by marrying foreign women
\add who worship idols\add*? \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*” 
\p
\v 28 One of the sons of Jehoiada, the son of Eliashib the supreme priest, had married the daughter of
\add our enemy\add* Sanballat, from Beth-Horon \add town\add*. So I forced Jehoiada to leave Jerusalem.
\p
\v 29 My God, do not forget that those people \add who have married foreign
women\add* have caused it to be a shame\f + \ft Or: disgrace \f* to be a priest, and have caused people to despise the agreement that you made
with the priests and with the descendants of Levi \add who help the
priests\add*! 
\p
\v 30 I did all that to make sure that there were no more foreign people among them who would encourage them
\add to worship idols\add*. I also established regulations for the priests and descendants of Levi, in order that they would
know what work they should do. 
\v 31 I also arranged for people to bring the firewood \add that was needed to burn on the
altar\add*, as \add Moses had declared\add* that we should do. I also arranged for the people to bring the first part of what
they harvested \add each year\add*. 
\p My God, do not forget that I \add have done all these things\add*, and bless me for doing them.
