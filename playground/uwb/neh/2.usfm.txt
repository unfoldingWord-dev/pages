\s Artaxerses allowed Nehemiah to go to Jerusalem 
\p
\v 1 During the twentieth year after King Artaxerxes \add began to rule the Persian
Empire\add*, ◄during the spring/before the hot season► of that year, when it was time to serve wine to him
\add during a feast\add*, I took the wine and gave it to the king. I had never looked sad when I was in front of him before,
\add but on that day he saw that I looked very sad\add*. 
\v 2 So he asked me, “Why are you sad? \add I know that\add* you are not sick. It must be that you are sad in your inner
being.” Then I was very afraid, \add because it was not proper to be sad when I came to the
king\add* \f + \ft (OR, \add because I was worried what the king would do to me if he refused to do what I was about to request him to
do\add*). 
\p
\v 3 I replied, “Your majesty, I hope you will live a very long time! But ◄how can I prevent myself from being sad, because the
city where my ancestors are buried \add has been destroyed\add* and is in ruins?/I cannot keep myself from looking sad, because
the city where my ancestors are buried \add has been destroyed\add* and is in ruins.► \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* Even the city gates have been
completely burned.” 
\p
\v 4 The king replied, “What do you want me to do \add for you\add*?”
\p I prayed \add silently\add* to our God \add who is/rules\add* in heaven
\v 5 Then I replied, “If you are willing \add to do it\add*, and if I have pleased you, send me to the city
\add of Jerusalem\add* in Judah \add province\add* where my ancestors are buried, in order that I may
\add help people to\add* rebuild the city.” 
\p
\v 6 While the queen was sitting beside the king, he asked, \add “If I allow you to
go\add*, how long will you be gone? When will you return?” I \add told the king how long I would be
gone\add*, and the king gave me permission to go, and I told him what day
\add I wanted to leave\add*. 
\p
\v 7 I also said to the king, “If you are willing to do it, write letters for me to take to the governors of the province west
of the \add Euphrates\add* River. Tell them to allow me to travel safely
\add through their province\add* until I arrive in Judah. 
\v 8 Also, \add please write\add* a letter to Asaph, the man who takes care of your forest
\add in that area\add*, telling him to give me timber to make the beams to support the gates of the fortress that is near the
temple, and timber for making the walls of the city, and for building the house in which I
\add will live\add*.” The king did what I requested him to do, because my God was graciously/kindly ◄helping/acting for► me.
\p
\v 9  \add After I got ready, I left to travel to Judah\add*. The king sent some army officers and soldiers riding on horses to
accompany me, \add to protect me\add*. When I came to where the governors of the provinces west of the
\add Euphrates\add* River lived, I gave them the letters that the king had written.
\p
\v 10 But when \add two government officials\add*, Sanballat from
\add a village near\add* Horon and Tobiah from the Ammon \add people-group\add*, heard that I had arrived, they were very angry
that someone had come to help the Israeli people. 
\s Nehemiah inspected the walls of Jerusalem 
\p
\v 11-12 When I arrived in Jerusalem, I did not tell anyone what thoughts God had given to me about what I should do there.
Three days after I arrived in Jerusalem, I went out of the city in the evening, taking a few men with me. I was riding a
donkey; we had no other animals with us. 
\p
\v 13 We left the city, going out through the Valley Gate, then past the well called the Jackal (OR, Dragon's) Well, and then
past the gate called the Rubbish/Garbage Gate. We inspected all the walls that had been broken down and all the gates that had
been burned down. 
\v 14 Then we went to the Fountain Gate and to the pool called the King's Pool, but my donkey could not get through
\add the narrow opening\add* (OR, \add the rubble\add*) \f*. 
\v 15 So we turned back and went along the \add Kidron\add* Valley. We inspected the wall there before we turned back/around
and entered the city again at the Valley Gate. 
\v 16 The \add city\add* officials did not know where I had gone or what I was doing, because I had not told anyone about what
I planned to do. I had not said anything about it to the Jewish leaders or the officials or the priests or any of the others
who would be helping me in the work \add that I wanted to do\add*.
\p
\v 17 But now I said to them, “You all know very well the terrible things
\add that have happened to\add* our city. The city is ruined; even the gates are burned down. So we should rebuild the city
wall. If we do that, we will no longer feel humiliated/disgraced.”
\v 18 Then I told them about how God had kindly/graciously helped me
\add when I talked to the king\add*, and what the king had said to me.
\p They immediately replied, “Let's start rebuilding!” So they started to do this good work.
\p
\v 19 But when Sanballat, Tobiah, and Gershom the Arab \add king of Kedar
region\add* heard about what we planned to do, they made fun of us and ridiculed us. They said, “What is this work that you are
doing? Are you rebelling against the king \add again\add*?” \f + \fk rhetorical question \f*
\p
\v 20 But I replied, “Our God who \add is/rules in\add* heaven will help our plans to succeed. But as for you, you have no
right to decide anything about this city, because you have not participated in what has happened in this city in previous
years.”
