\s The agreement 
\p
\v 28 Then the rest of the people also made a solemn agreement. The people who did it included priests, temple gatekeepers,
singers, and temple workers. They also included all the men from other countries who had separated themselves from the other
foreigners living in Israel. These men, along with their wives, their sons and daughters who were old enough to understand
\add what they were doing, were people who wanted to obey God's laws\add*.
\v 29 They all joined with their leaders in making this solemn agreement. They agreed to obey all the laws that God had given
to Moses. They agreed to obey everything that Yahweh our God had commanded, and all his regulations and instructions.
\add And this is what they promised to do:\add* 
\pi
\v 30 “We will not allow our daughters to marry people who live in this land
\add who do not worship Yahweh\add*, and we will not allow our sons to marry them.
\pi
\v 31 If people from other countries who live in this land bring us grain or other things to sell to us on Sabbath days or any
other sacred day, we will not buy anything from them. And in every seventh year, we will not plant any crops, and we will
◄cancel all debts\f + \ft Or: declare \f* that people will no longer have to pay back what they owe us►.
\pi
\v 32 We also promise that every year we will pay ◄one-eighth of an ounce\f + \ft Or: 4 \f* grams► of silver for the work of taking care of the
temple. 
\v 33 With that money they can buy these things: the sacred bread
\add that is placed before God\add*, the grain that is burned \add on the
altar\add* each day, the lambs that were completely burned \add on the
altar\add*, the sacred offerings for the Sabbath days and for celebrating each new moon and other festivals that God told us to
celebrate, and other offerings that are dedicated to God, the animals to be sacrificed to atone for the sins of the Israeli
people, and anything else that is needed for the work of taking care of the temple.
\pi
\v 34 Each year the priests, the descendants of Levi who help the priests, and the rest of us will ◄cast lots\f + \ft Or: throw \f* marked
stones► to determine \add for that year\add* which clans will provide wood to burn
\add on the altar\add* to burn the sacrifices that are offered to Yahweh our God, in order to do what was written in the laws
\add God gave to Moses\add*. 
\pi
\v 35 We promise that each year each family will take to the temple an offering from the first grain that we harvest and from
the first fruit that grows on our trees \add that year\add*. 
\pi
\v 36 Also, we will take to the priests at the temple our firstborn sons and dedicate them to God. And we will also bring
firstborn calves and lambs and baby goats \add to be offered as sacrifices\add*. That is what is written in God's laws
\add that we must do\add*. 
\pi
\v 37 We will also take to the priests at the temple the flour made from the first grain
\add that we harvest each year\add*, and our other offerings of wine,
\add olive\add* oil, and fruit. We will also take to the descendants of Levi
\add who help the priests\add* the tithes\f + \ft Or: 10 \f*% \add of the crops that we
grow\add* on our land, because they are the ones who collect the tithes in all the villages where we work\f + \ft Or: live \f*.
\v 38 The priests who are descendants of Aaron will be with the descendants of Levi and supervise them when they collect the
tithes. Then the descendants of Levi must take 10% of the things that people bring and put them in the storerooms in the
temple. 
\v 39 The descendants of Levi and \add some of\add* the other Israeli people must take the offerings of grain, wine, and
\add olive\add* oil to the storerooms where the various utensils that are used in the temple are kept. That is the place where
the priests who are serving at that time, the temple guards, and those who sing in the temple choir live.
\pi \add We promise that\add* we will not neglect \add taking care of the temple of our
God\add*.”
