\s The Egyptians caused the Israeli people to suffer greatly 
\p
\v 1 The sons of Jacob who went to Egypt with him along with their families were
\v 2 Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, 
\v 3 Issachar, Zebulun, Benjamin, 
\v 4 Dan, Naphtali, Gad, and Asher. 
\v 5 Altogether there were 70 people \add who went with\add* Jacob. That included his
\add sons, his grandsons, and two great-grandsons\add*. \add His
son\add* Joseph was already in Egypt. 
\p
\v 6  \add Eventually\add* Joseph and his \add older and younger\add* brothers and everyone
\add else in their family who lived\add* ◄in that generation/at that time► died.
\v 7 But Jacob's descendants kept giving birth to many children [IDI]. The
\add number of his descendants\add* kept becoming larger and larger. As a result, there were so many of them that they were
everywhere in Egypt (OR, that they \add became a threat\add* to the Egyptians).
\v 8 Then \add several hundred years later\add*, a new king began to rule [MTY] in Egypt. He did not know
\add what\add* Joseph \add had done for the people of Egypt long
ago\add*. 
\v 9 He said to his people, “Look \add at what has happened\add*! The Israeli people have become so numerous and so powerful
that they \add now are dangerous\add* to us! 
\v 10 We must find a way to control them! If we do not do that, their population will continue to grow. Then, if enemies [PRS]
attack us, they will join with our enemies and fight against us, and they will escape from
\add our\add* land.” 
\p
\v 11 So \add the king and his officials\add* put supervisors over them to cause them to suffer very much by
\add forcing them\add* to work very hard. They forced \add the Israeli people
to\add* build \add two\add* cities, Pithom and Ramses, in which to store
\add supplies for the king/government\add*. 
\v 12 But the more cruelly they treated the \add Israeli people\add*, the bigger the Israeli
\add population\add* grew, and they became more numerous all over
\add the land\add*. So the Egyptian people began to be afraid of the Israeli people.
\v 13 They forced the Israeli people to work very hard, 
\v 14 and by making them slaves, they made their lives miserable. They
\add forced them\add* to \add build many buildings with\add* mortar and bricks.
\add They also forced them to do\add* other work in the fields. \add In making them do all this work, the Egyptian officials
treated them\add* ruthlessly/cruelly. 
\p
\v 15 There were two Hebrew ◄midwives/women who helped the women when they were giving birth►. Their names were Shiphrah and
Puah. The king of Egypt said to \add those two women\add*, 
\v 16 “When you help the Hebrew women when they are giving birth [MTY], if
\add the baby that is born\add* is a boy, you must kill it. If \add the
baby\add* is a girl, you ◄may let it live/do not have to kill them►.”
\v 17 But the midwives feared/reverenced God. So they did not do what the king told them to do. They allowed the baby boys to
live. 
\v 18 So the king summoned the \add two\add* midwives and said to them, “Why are you doing this? Why are you letting the baby
boys live?” 
\v 19  \add One of\add* the midwives replied to the king, “\add You need to realize
that\add* the Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women. The Hebrew women are very strong/healthy. They give birth
\add to their babies\add* before we can get to them \add to help
them\add*.” 
\p
\v 20 So God acted kindly toward the midwives, and the \add Hebrew\add* people became very numerous and strong.
\v 21 Furthermore, because the midwives feared/reverenced God, \add God\add* enabled them also to give birth to children.
\p
\v 22 Then the king commanded all the \add Egyptian\add* people/his
\add ◄advisors\add*► this: “You must throw into the Nile \add River\add* every baby boy born that the
\add Hebrew women\add* give birth to! But you can allow the baby girls to live.”
