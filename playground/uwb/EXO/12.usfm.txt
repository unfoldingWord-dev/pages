\s Yahweh instructed Moses and Aaron about the Passover festival
\p
\v 1 Yahweh said to Aaron and Moses/me there in Egypt, 
\v 2 “\add From now on\add*, this month \add will be\add* the first month of the year for you.
\v 3 Tell all the Israeli people that in each family, the man who heads the family must take a lamb or a young goat for his
household. 
\v 4 If there are not enough people in his family to eat a whole
\add cooked\add* lamb, then his family and the family that lives next door may share one animal. Decide how many lambs you need
according to the number of people in each family, and according to how much each person can eat.
\v 5 The lambs or goats that you choose must be males, a year-old, and they must not have any defects.
\v 6 You must take \add special\add* care of these animals until the 14th day of the month. On that day, all the Israeli people
must slaughter the lambs \add or goats\add* in the evening. 
\v 7 Then they must take some of the blood \add from the lambs or
goats\add*, and they must smear it on the doorposts and the ◄lintels/horizontal beams above the doorways► of the houses in
which they will eat the meat. 
\v 8 They must roast the animals immediately and eat the meat that night. They must eat it with bread that is baked without
yeast and with bitter herbs. 
\v 9 You must not eat any of the meat raw, and you must not boil the meat. You must roast it
\add whole\add*, without cutting off the head or the legs or removing the internal parts.
\v 10 You must eat all the meat that evening; do not let any of the meat remain
\add to be eaten\add* the next morning. If any of the meat is left the next morning, you must
\add completely\add* burn it. 
\v 11 When you eat it, you must be dressed ready to travel. You must have your sandals on your feet and your walking stick in
your hands. It will be a festival \add called\add* Passover to \add honor\add* me, Yahweh.
\v 12 On that night I will go through all the land of Egypt, and I will kill all the oldest males in Egypt, both humans and
animals. \add By doing this\add* I will punish all the gods in Egypt.
\add I can do this\add*, because I am Yahweh, \add the all-powerful
God\add*. 
\v 13 The blood \add that you smear on the doorways will be a mark to
indicate\add* the houses in which you \add Israelis\add* live. When I see the blood, I will
\add ignore and\add* pass by those houses, and I will not harm you
\add people who live there\add*, when I punish the Egyptians. 
\p
\v 14  \add Each year\add*, you must celebrate this festival on this day, to remember
\add what I\add*, Yahweh, \add have done for you\add*. In all the generations to come,
\add each year\add* you must celebrate \add this festival\add*. \add It must
continue\add* forever. 
\v 15 For seven days you must eat bread that has no yeast in it. On the first day of that week you must get rid of all the
yeast that is in your houses. During those seven days, if anyone eats bread that is baked with yeast in it,
\add you must consider\add* that person to be no longer an Israeli.
\v 16 On the first day \add of that week\add*, you must ◄have a holy meeting/gather together to
\add worship\add* me►. You must do the same thing on the seventh day. People must not work on those two days. The only work
they may do is to prepare food for you to eat. 
\p
\v 17  \add Every year\add* you must keep celebrating this festival of eating bread that has no yeast in it, because it will
remind you that it was on this day that I brought all your tribal groups out of the land of Egypt. So
\add every year\add*, in all the generations to come, you must celebrate this day as a festival. It must continue forever.
\v 18-19 In the first month of the year, on the 14th day of that month, the only bread you may eat is bread that has no yeast
in it. You must keep doing that each day until the 21st day of that month. For those seven days you must not have any yeast in
your house. \add During that time\add*, if anyone, either an Israeli or a foreigner, eats bread made with yeast, you must
consider that person no longer to be an Israeli. 
\v 20 In your houses, do not eat anything that has yeast in it during those seven days.”
\p
\v 21 Then Moses/I summoned all the leaders of the Israeli people. He/I said to them, “Each family should select a lamb and
kill it, \add in order that you may eat it to celebrate the festival that will be
called\add* 'Passover.' 
\v 22 Let the lamb's blood \add drain into\add* a basin. Get a bunch/sprig of ◄hyssop/a very leafy plant► and dip it in the
blood. Then smear some of the blood on the doorposts and the ◄lintels/beams above the doorways►
\add of your houses\add*. The people in each house must all stay inside the house until the next morning.
\v 23 When Yahweh goes through Egypt to kill \add the oldest male in
each\add* Egyptian family, he will see the blood on your ◄lintels/beams of your doorways►, and he will
\add ignore and\add* pass by those houses. He will not allow the angel who causes people to die to enter your houses and kill
\add any of\add* your \add oldest sons\add*. 
\v 24 You and your descendants must celebrate this ritual forever.
\v 25 And when you arrive in the land that Yahweh will be giving to you as he promised, you must keep celebrating this ritual
\add every year\add*. 
\v 26 When your children ask you, ‘What does this ritual mean?’,
\v 27 you must tell them, ‘This ritual is \add to remember how\add*
\add your ancestors\add* sacrificed \add lambs\add* on the night that Yahweh's angel passed by the houses of the Israeli people
\add when they were\add* in Egypt. He killed the \add oldest males/sons in
all\add* the Egyptian houses, but he spared \add the sons in\add* [MTY] our houses.’ ” After Moses/I told them this, they all
bowed their heads and worshiped \add Yahweh\add*. 
\v 28 Then the Israeli people did what Yahweh had told Aaron and Moses/me
\add to tell them to do\add*. 
\s Yahweh killed all the oldest Egyptian males 
\p
\v 29 At midnight Yahweh killed all the oldest sons of the Egyptian people, all over Egypt. That included the king's oldest
son, the oldest sons of the prisoners in the dungeon/jail, and \add the oldest sons of everyone
else\add*. He also killed the oldest males of all the Egyptians' livestock.
\v 30 That night the king, all his officials, and \add all the rest
of\add* the Egyptian people awoke \add and discovered what had happened\add*. They wailed loudly all over Egypt, because in
every house, someone's son had died. 
\s The Israeli people left Egypt 
\p
\v 31 That night the king summoned Aaron and Moses/me and said, “Get up, you and all the
\add other\add* Israeli people, and leave my country \add immediately\add*! Go and worship Yahweh, as you requested!
\v 32 Take your flocks \add of sheep and goats\add* and herds \add of
cattle\add*, and leave! And ask Yahweh to bless me, also!” 
\p
\v 33 Then the Israeli people did as Moses/I had told them. They
\add went to\add* their Egyptian \add neighbors\add* and asked them for silver and gold jewelry and clothing.
\v 34 Yahweh caused the Egyptian people to greatly respect the \add Israeli\add* people, so they gave them what they asked for.
In that way, they carried away the wealth of the Egyptian people.
\v 35 The Egyptians urged the \add Israeli\add* people to leave their country quickly. They said,
“\add If you do not do that\add*, we will all die!” 
\v 36 So the \add Israeli\add* people \add prepared to leave at once\add*. They took the bowls in which they mixed the dough to
make bread, and the dough that was in the bowls without any yeast in it, and they wrapped the bowls in their cloaks. They put
the bowls on their shoulders \add and left\add*. 
\p
\v 37 The Israeli people traveled from Rameses \add city\add* to Succoth
\add town\add*. There were about 600,000 men who went, in addition to the women and children.
\v 38 Many other people who were not Israelis went along with them. There were also livestock, including flocks
\add of sheep and goats\add* and herds \add of cattle\add*. 
\v 39 On their way, they baked bread with the dough that they carried with them when they had been expelled from Egypt. The
dough did not have yeast in it, because they were told to leave Egypt so quickly that they did not have enough time to get food
ready to take with them, or enough time to mix yeast in the dough.
\p
\v 40 The Israeli people had lived in Egypt 430 years. 
\v 41 On the day that those 430 years ended, on that very day, all the tribes of Yahweh's people left Egypt.
\v 42 It was a night when Yahweh ◄protected/guarded over► them as he brought them out of Egypt. So this same night every year
is a night that is dedicated to Yahweh, a night when the Israeli people in every generation
\add remember how\add* Yahweh protected their ancestors. 
\s Yahweh instructed Moses and Aaron about future Passover festivals
\p
\v 43-44 Then Yahweh said this to Aaron and Moses/me: “These are my instructions about the Passover ritual: do not let
foreigners eat \add the Passover meal\add*. But any male slaves that you have bought may eat it after you have circumcised
them. 
\v 45 Do not let people who are living among you temporarily, or servants whom you have hired, eat
\add the Passover meal\add*. 
\v 46 Each family must eat the Passover meal inside their own house. Do not take any of the food outside the house.
\v 47 All the Israeli people must celebrate this festival. 
\v 48 When someone from another country comes to live with you and wants to celebrate the Passover festival, circumcise all the
males in his household. Then they can eat the Passover meal, and you should treat that man as though he was born an Israeli.
But do not allow men who have not been circumcised to eat the Passover meal.
\v 49 These rules apply to people who were born as Israelis and to foreigners who come and live among you.”
\p
\v 50 All the Israeli people obeyed Aaron and Moses/me and did what Yahweh had commanded.
\v 51 On that very day Yahweh brought all the tribes of the Israeli people out of Egypt.
