\c 4  
\s Boaz married Ruth 
\p
\v 1  \add Meanwhile\add*, Boaz went up to the town gate and sat there.
\add That was the place where people met together to decide important
matters\add*. When the man that Boaz had mentioned came there, the close relative of Ruth and Naomi's dead husbands who had a
responsibility to take care of Naomi and Ruth, Boaz said to him, “My friend, come over here and sit down.” So the man went and
sat down. 
\v 2 Boaz then gathered ten of the elders of the town and asked them to sit down
\add there\add*. After they sat down, 
\v 3 he said to the man who had the responsibility to take care of Naomi, “Naomi has returned from Moab
\add region\add*. She wants to sell the field that belonged to our relative Elimelech.
\v 4 I thought that I should tell you about that, and suggest that you buy it, while these elders who are sitting here are
listening. If you are willing to buy the property, do that. But if you do not want to buy it, tell me, so that I will know. I
am suggesting this to you because you are the one who has the first right to buy it, and I am the one who has the second\f + \ft Or: next \f*
right to buy it.” The man replied, “I will buy it!” 
\v 5 Then Boaz told him, “When you buy the land from Naomi, you will also be taking Ruth,
\add the woman\add* who is from Moab, \add to be your wife\add*, in order that she may
\add give birth to a son who\add* will inherit the property of her dead husband \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f*.”
\v 6 Then the close relative \add of Ruth's first husband\add* said,
“\add If that is so\add*, I do not \add want to\add* buy the field, because then my own
\add children\add* would not inherit the property; \add Ruth's children would inherit
it\add*. You buy the property!” 
\p
\v 7 At that time, it was the custom in Israel, when one person bought property that belonged to another person, that the man
who was selling the property would take off one of his sandals and give it to the one who was buying the property. That was the
way they finalized sales in Israel. 
\v 8 So that close relative said to Boaz, “You buy the field yourself!” And he took off
\add one of\add* his sandals \add and gave it to Boaz\add*. 
\p
\v 9 Then Boaz said to the elders and all the \add other\add* people
\add who were there\add*, “Today you have all seen that I have bought from Naomi all the property that belonged to
\add her dead husband\add* Elimelech and \add his dead sons\add* Mahlon and Chilion.
\v 10 I am also taking Ruth, \add the woman\add* from Moab, Mahlon's widow, to be my wife, in order that she may give birth to
a son who will inherit the property of the dead men. In that way, Elimelech's name will continue \\f + \\ft litotes \\f* among the members of his
family and among all the people of this town. Today you all are witnesses
\add of what I have done\add*.” 
\p
\v 11 All the elders and the \add others\add* who were sitting at the
\add town\add* gate \add agreed, and one of them\add* said, “\add Yes\add*, we are witnesses. We hope\f + \ft Or: desire \f* that Yahweh will
enable this woman, who will be coming into your home, to give birth to many children, as Rachel and Leah did. They are the
women from whom all \add us\add* people \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* of Israel are descended. We hope that you will become rich in the clan of
Ephratah, and become famous \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* \add here\add* in Bethlehem. 
\v 12 We hope\f + \ft Or: desire \f* that Yahweh will enable you and this young woman to have many descendants, those who will descend from
this young woman. And we hope\f + \ft Or: desire \f* that your family will be as important as the family of your ancestor Perez, the son of
Judah and Tamar.” 
\p
\v 13 So Boaz took Ruth \add home\add*, and she became his wife. He ◄slept with\f + \ft Or: had \f* sex with► her \\f + \\ft euphemism \\f* and Yahweh enabled her
to become pregnant, and she gave birth to a son. 
\v 14 The women \add of Bethlehem\add* said to Naomi, “Praise Yahweh! Now he has given \\f + \\ft litotes \\f* you a grandson who will be the one
who will have the responsibility to take care of you. We hope that he will become famous \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* throughout Israel.
\v 15 He will make you feel young again, and he will take care of you when you become old. Your daughter-in-law, who loves you,
has given birth to a son, who will ◄be better to\f + \ft Or: do \f* more for► you than
\add if you had\add* seven sons \add of your own\add*.” 
\p
\v 16 Then Naomi took the baby and put him on her lap, and took care of him.
\v 17 The women who were living \add nearby\add* said, “\add It is as
though\add* Naomi \add now\add* has a son!” And they named him Obed.
\add Later\add*, Obed became the father of Jesse, and later Jesse became the father of
\add King\add* David. 
\p
\v 18-22 Here is \add a list of\add* the descendants of Perez: Perez's son was Hezron. Hezron's son was Ram. Ram's son was
Amminadab. Amminadab's son was Nahshon. Nahshon's son was Salmon. Salmon's son was Boaz. Boaz's son was Obed. Obed's son was
Jesse. Jesse's son was \add King\add* David.
