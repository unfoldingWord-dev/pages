\s Ruth asked Boaz to marry her so she would have a home and other things she needed
\p
\v 1 One day, Naomi said to Ruth, “My daughter, I think that I should [RHQ] try to arrange for you to have a husband [MTY] who
will ◄take care of/provide for► you. 
\v 2 Boaz, the man with whose servant girls you have been \add gathering
grain\add*, is a close relative \add of our dead husbands\add*. Listen
\add carefully\add*. Tonight he will be at the ground where \add the barley
has\add* been threshed. He will be separating the barley grain from the chaff.
\v 3 Bathe yourself and put on some perfume. Put on your \add best\add* clothes. Then go down to the ground where they have
threshed \add the grain\add*. But do not let him know that you are there while he is eating
\add supper\add* and drinking. 
\v 4  \add When he has finished eating\add*, notice where he lies down to sleep. Then
\add when he is asleep\add*, take \add the blanket\add* off his feet and lie
\add close to his feet\add*. \add When he wakes up\add*, he will tell you what to do.”
\p
\v 5 Ruth replied, “I will do everything that you have told me \add to
do\add*.” 
\v 6 So she went down to the ground where they had threshed \add the barley
grain\add*. There she did everything that her mother-in-law had told
\add her to do\add*. 
\p
\v 7 When Boaz finished eating \add supper\add* and drinking \add wine\add*, he felt happy. Then he went over to the far end of
the pile of grain. He lay down \add and went to sleep\add*. Then Ruth approached him quietly. She took the blanket off his feet
and lay down \add there\add*. 
\v 8 In the middle of the night, he suddenly awoke. He sat up and saw that a woman was lying at his feet.
\v 9 He asked her, “Who are you?” She replied, “I am your servant, Ruth. Since you are the one who has a responsibility to take
care of \add someone like me whose dead husband was\add* your close relative, spread the corner of your cloak over my
\add feet to show that you will marry me\add*.” 
\p
\v 10 Boaz replied, “Young lady, I hope that Yahweh will ◄bless/be kind to► you! You acted kindly
\add toward your mother-in-law\add* previously, and now you are acting even more kindly
\add toward me by wanting to marry me, instead of wanting to marry a young
man\add*. You have not looked for either a rich young man or a poor young man,
\add to marry him\add*. 
\v 11 Now, young lady, I will do everything you ask. Don't worry
\add that people in this town might think I am doing wrong by marrying you because you are a woman from
Moab\add*. All the people in this town know that you are an honorable woman.
\v 12 But \add there is one problem\add*. Although it is true that I am a close relative
\add of your mother's dead husband\add*, there is another man who is a closer relative
\add than I am\add*, and therefore he should be the one to \add marry you
and\add* take care of you. 
\v 13 You stay here for the rest of this night. Tomorrow morning
\add I will tell this man about you\add*. If he says that he will
\add marry you and\add* take are of you, fine, \add we will\add* let him do that. But if he is not willing
\add to do that\add*, I solemnly promise that as surely as Yahweh lives, I will
\add marry you and\add* take are of you. So lie/sleep here until it is morning.”
\p
\v 14 So she lay at his feet until morning. But she got up and left before it was light enough that people would be able to
recognize her, because Boaz said, “I do not want anyone to know that a woman was here.”
\v 15 He also said to her, “Bring to me your cloak and spread it out.” When she did that, he poured into it six measures/24
liters/50 pounds of barley, and put in on her back. Then he (OR, she) went back to the town.
\p
\v 16 When Ruth arrived home, her mother-in-law asked her, “My daughter, how did ◄things go/Boaz act toward you►?” Then Ruth
told her everything that Boaz had done for her \add and said to her\add*.
\v 17 She also said \add to Naomi\add*, “He gave me all this barley, saying ‘I do not want you to return to your mother-in-law
empty-handed.’ ” 
\v 18 Then Naomi said, “My daughter, just wait until we see what happens.
\add I am sure that\add* Boaz will surely take care of [LIT] the matter today. [LIT]”
