\s Ruth declared she would stay with Naomi 
\p
\v 1 During the time before kings ruled Israel, ◄there was a famine/the people there had nothing to eat►. There was a man who
lived there whose name was Elimelech. His wife's name was Naomi, and his sons' names were Mahlon and Chilion. They were all
from Bethlehem \add town\add*, from the Ephrath \add clan\add* in Judah
\add region\add*. 
\v 2 Because of the famine, they left Bethlehem and went east to
\add live for a while\add* in Moab \add region\add*. 
\p
\v 3 Then Elimelech died, and Naomi had only her two sons with her.
\v 4 They married women from Moab. One of them was named Orpah, and the other one was named Ruth. But after they had lived in
that area for about ten years, 
\v 5 Mahlon and Chilion died. So then Naomi had no husband and no sons.
\p
\v 6 Then while Naomi was in Moab, she heard someone say that Yahweh had helped his people in Israel and that now there was
plenty of food to eat. So she prepared to return to \add Bethlehem\add*.
\v 7 So she left the place where she had been living and started to walk along the road back to Judah.
\v 8 Then as the three of them were walking, Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, “Each of you should turn around and go
back to your mother's home. You treated \add your husbands\add* kindly
\add before they\add* died, and you have treated me kindly. 
\v 9 Now I desire that Yahweh will enable each of you to have another husband in whose home you will
\add feel\add* secure.” Then she kissed each of them, and they cried aloud.
\v 10 They each said, “No, we want to go with you to return to your relatives.”
\p
\v 11 But Naomi said, “No, my daughters, return home. ◄It will not do anything good for you to come with me!/What good will it
do for you to come with me?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* Do you \add think\add* I will get married again and have more sons who could become your
husbands? 
\v 12 Even if I thought I could have another husband, and even if I got married today and became pregnant \f + \fr euphemism \f* tonight and
later gave birth to sons, 
\v 13 would you remain single/unmarried until they grew up \add and became old enough
for\add* you to marry? No, my daughters, \add you would not do that\add*. Your situations are bad
\add because your husbands have died, but it is possible that you will each marry
again\add*. So my situation is much worse, because Yahweh \f + \fr synecdoche \f* has opposed me,
\add and now I am too old to get married again\add*.” 
\p
\v 14 Then Ruth and Orpah cried again \add because of what Naomi
said\add*. Then Orpah kissed her mother-in-law goodbye, \add and
left\add*, but Ruth clung to Naomi. 
\v 15 Naomi said to her, “Look! Your sister-in-law is going back to her relatives and to her gods! Go back with her!”
\v 16 But Ruth replied, “No! Don't urge me to leave you! \add I want\add* to go with you. Where you go, I will go. Where you
stay, I will stay. Your relatives will be my relatives, and the God you
\add worship\add* will be the God I \add worship\add*. 
\v 17 Where you die, I will die. Where you are buried, I will be buried. May Yahweh punish me severely if I separate from you.
I will be separated from you only \add when one of us\add* dies.”
\v 18 When Naomi realized that Ruth was very determined to go with her, she stopped urging her
\add to return home\add*. 
\p
\v 19 So the two women continued walking until they came to Bethlehem. When they arrived there, everyone in town was excited
\add to see\add* them. The women \add of the town\add* exclaimed, “◄Can this be Naomi?/It is difficult to believe that this is
Naomi!►” \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* 
\v 20 Naomi said to them, “Don't call me Naomi, \add which means
‘pleasant’\add*. Instead, call me Mara, \add which means ‘bitter’\add*, because God Almighty has made my life very unpleasant.
\v 21 When I left here, I \add felt\add* rich, \add because I had a
family\add*. But Yahweh has brought me back here and now I \add feel\add* poor,
\add because I have no family\add*. Do not call me Naomi \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*. \add I feel as
though\add* Yahweh has spoken against \f + \fr (OR, afflicted) \f* me. Almighty
\add God\add* has caused a great tragedy to happen to me.” 
\p
\v 22 That \add summarizes\add* \add the account\add* of Naomi returning home along with her daughter-in-law Ruth, the woman
from Moab. And \add it happened that\add* when they arrived in Bethlehem, the barley
\add grain\add* harvest was just beginning.
