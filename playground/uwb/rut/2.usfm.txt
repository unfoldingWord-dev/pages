\s Ruth met Boaz 
\p
\v 1 There was a man in Bethlehem who belonged to the clan of \add her dead
husband\add*, Elimelech. He was rich and well-known\f + \ft Or: influential \f*. His name was Boaz.
\p
\v 2  \add One day\add* Ruth said to Naomi, "Let me go to the fields and pick up the left-over grain behind anyone who acts
kindly toward me." Naomi replied, "Go ahead, my daughter." 
\v 3 So Ruth went to the fields and began to pick up some of the left-over grain behind the men who were harvesting it. And it
happened that she was working in a field that belonged to Boaz, \add the
man\add* from the clan of \add her dead father-in-law\add*, Elimelech!
\p
\v 4 Just then, Boaz arrived from Bethlehem. He greeted the men who were harvesting the grain, saying, "I want Yahweh to bless
you!" They replied, "We want Yahweh to bless you, \add too\add*!"
\p
\v 5 Then Boaz saw Ruth, and asked the foreman\f + \ft Or: man in charge of the other workmen \f*, "Whose
\add daughter\add* is that young woman?" 
\v 6 The foreman replied, "She is the woman from Moab who returned from there with
\add her mother-in-law\add* Naomi. 
\v 7 She said to me, 'Please let me pick up some of the left-over grain
\add as I walk\add* behind the men who are harvesting the grain.'
\add I gave her permission, and\add* she went into the field, and she has been working from this morning until now. The only
time she did not work was when she rested for a short time in the shelter."
\p
\v 8 So Boaz went over to Ruth and said to her, "Young lady, listen to me. Don't go and pick up grain in another field. Do not
go away from here. Stay here with my servant girls. 
\v 9 Watch where the men are harvesting, and follow along behind the
\add servant\add* girls. I will tell the men \add who are working\add* not to touch\f + \ft Or: molest \f* you. And whenever you are thirsty,
go and get some water to drink from the jars that the men have filled."
\p
\v 10 When he said that, she knelt down in front of him \add in respect\add*, with her face touching the ground. She exclaimed,
"Why are you acting so kindly toward me, by paying attention to me?
\add I am not even a Jew; I am\add* a foreigner!" 
\v 11 Boaz replied, "People have told me all about what you have done for your mother-in-law. They told me that you left your
parents and your homeland, and you came here to live among people whom you did not know before.
\v 12 I hope\f + \ft Or: desire \f* that Yahweh will repay you for what you have done. You have put yourself
\add in the care of\add* Yahweh, \add like a little bird puts itself\add* under its mother's wings \f + \ft metaphor \f*. I desire that he will
reward you very greatly." 
\p
\v 13 She replied, "Sir, I hope you will continue to act kindly toward me. You have comforted\f + \ft Or: encouraged \f* me, even though I do
not have the status that any of your servant girls have." 
\p
\v 14 At mealtime, Boaz said to her, "Come over here. Take some bread and dip it in the wine vinegar
\add and eat it\add*." Then when she sat down with the men who had been harvesting, he offered her some roasted grain. She ate
all the grain she wanted, and had some left over. 
\v 15 As she stood up to start gathering grain \add again\add*, Boaz ordered his workers, "Even if she gathers some grain near
the bundles of grain that have been cut, do not scold her. 
\v 16 Instead, pull out some stalks of grain from the bundles, and leave them on the ground for her to pick up, and do not
rebuke her." 
\p
\v 17 So Ruth gathered grain in the field until evening. Then she threshed\f + \ft Or: beat with a stick \f* the barley that she had
gathered, \add to separate the kernels from the stalks\add*, and the barley filled a large basket.
\v 18 She carried it back to town, and showed to her mother-in-law how much she had gathered. Ruth also showed to her the grain
\add that was left over after\add* she had eaten enough from \add what Boaz had
given\add* \add her at lunchtime\add*. 
\v 19 Her mother-in-law asked her, "Where did you gather grain today? In whose
\add field\add* did you work? \add God will\add* surely bless the man who was kind to you." Then Ruth told her about the man in
whose field she had been working. She said, "The name of the man
\add who owns the field\add* where I worked today is Boaz." 
\v 20 Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, "I hope\f + \ft Or: desire \f* that Yahweh will bless him! He has not stopped acting kindly toward
\add us, who are still\add* living, and to \add our husbands\add* who have died." Then she added, "That man is a close relative
\add of Elimelech\add*; he is one of those who has a responsibility to help those who are his relatives."
\p
\v 21 Then Ruth said, "He also said to me, 'Stay with my workers until they have finished harvesting all my grain.'Â "
\p
\v 22 Naomi replied, "My daughter, it will be good for you to go
\add to his field\add* with his \add servant\add* girls, because if you go to someone else's field, someone might harm\f + \ft Or: molest \f*
you." 
\p
\v 23 So Ruth stayed close to Boaz's servant girls \add while she was
working\add*. She gathered stalks of grain until the barley harvest and the wheat harvest were finished. During that time she
lived with Naomi.
