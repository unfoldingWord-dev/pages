\s Bringing back the Sacred Chest 
\p
\v 1  \add One day\add* David talked with all his army officers. Some of them were commanders of 100 soldiers and some were
commanders of 1000 soldiers. 
\v 2 Then he summoned the other Israeli leaders and said to them, "If it seems to you to be a good thing for us to do, and if
it is what Yahweh our God wants, let's send a message to our fellow Israelis in all the areas of our country, including the
priests and descendants of Levi who are living among them in their towns and in the nearby pasturelands, to come and join us,
\v 3 because we want to bring the Sacred Chest of our God back to us. While Saul
\add was the king\add*, We did not go to God's presence to ask him what we should do."
\v 4 All the people agreed with David, because they all thought that it was the right thing to do.
\p
\v 5 So David gathered all the Israeli people, from the Shihor \add River
in\add* Egypt to Lebo-Hamath \add town in the north\add*, \add and told them that he wanted them to
help\add* bring the Sacred Chest of God \add back to Jerusalem\add* from Kiriath-Jearim
\add city\add*. 
\v 6 David went with all the Israeli people to Baalah \add town\add*, which is
\add another name for\add* Kiriath-Jearim, to get the Sacred Chest.
\add The people believed that\add* God ruled from between the statues of winged creatures that was above the lid of the Sacred
Chest, and the Sacred Chest belongs to Yahweh \f + \ft metonymy \f*. 
\p
\v 7 The people put the Sacred Chest on a new cart and carried it from Abinadab's house. Uzzah and Ahio were guiding
\add the oxen that were pulling the cart\add*. 
\v 8 David and all the Israeli people were celebrating in God's presence. They were singing with all their strength, and
\add playing\add* lyres, harps, tambourines, and cymbals, and \add blowing\add* trumpets.
\p
\v 9 But when David's men came to the place where Kidon threshed grain, the oxen stumbled. So Uzzah reached out with his hand
to prevent the Sacred Chest from falling off the cart. 
\v 10 Yahweh immediately became very angry with Uzzah, and as he was watching, he caused Uzzah to suddenly die there because he
had put his hand on the Sacred Chest, \add and Yahweh had commanded that only the descendants of Levi who help the priests
should touch the Sacred Chest\add*. 
\p
\v 11 David was angry because Yahweh had punished \f + \ft metonymy \f* Uzzah. And now that place
\add where Uzzah died\add* is called 'The Punishment of Uzzah.' 
\p
\v 12 That day, David was afraid of God. He asked \add himself\add*, "How can I\f + \ft Or: I am afraid to \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* bring God's Sacred Chest
to my \add city\add*." 
\v 13 So the men with David did not take the Sacred chest to Jerusalem. Instead, they took it to the house of Obed-Edom, who
was from Gath \add city\add*. 
\v 14 The Sacred Chest stayed with Obed-Edom's family in his house for three months. And
\add during that time\add* Yahweh blessed Obed-Edom's family and everything that he owned.
