\v 29 Bilhah, Ezem, Tolad,

\v 33 There were other villages where they lived, as far \add southwest\add* as Baalath

\v 41 But while Hezekiah was the king of Judah, those leaders of the tribe of Simeon came to Gedor and fought against the
descendants of Ham and destroyed their tents. They also fought against the descendants of Meun who were living there and they
killed all of them. So now there are no descendants of Meun living there. The descendants of Simeon started to live there,
because there was good pastureland there for their sheep. 
\p
