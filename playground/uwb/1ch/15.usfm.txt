\s They brought the Sacred Chest to Jerusalem 
\p
\v 1 David commanded his workers to build houses for himself in Jerusalem. He also told them to set up a tent in which to put
the Sacred Chest. 
\v 2 He said, “Only the descendants of Levi are permitted to carry God's Sacred Chest, because they are the ones whom God chose
to carry it and to serve him forever.” 
\p
\v 3 David summoned all the people of Israel to come to Jerusalem. He wanted the Sacred Chest of Yahweh to be put in the place
that he had made for it. 
\v 4 He summoned the descendants of Aaron, \add who was the first Supreme
Priest\add*, and the descendants of Levi. 
\li
\v 5 120 descendants of Kohath, who was Levi's second son, came, with Uriel their leader.
\li
\v 6 There were 220 descendants of Merari, Levi's third son, who came, with Asaiah their leader.
\li
\v 7 There were 130 descendants of Gershon, Levi's first son, who came, with Joel their leader.
\li
\v 8 Also, there were 200 people from Elizaphan's clan who came, with Shemaiah their leader.
\li
\v 9 There were 80 people from Hebron's clan who came, with Eliel their leader.
\li
\v 10 And there were 112 people from Uzziel's clan who came, with Amminadab their leader.
\p
\v 11 David summoned the priests Zadok and Abiathar, and these descendants of Levi: Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and
Amminadab. 
\v 12 David said to them, “You are the leaders of the clans descended from Levi. You and the other descendants of Levi must
purify yourselves, in order to \add be able to do this special work for Yahweh. You
must\add* bring the Sacred Chest of Yahweh, the God of us Israelis, up to the place that I have made for it
\add here in Jerusalem\add*. 
\v 13 The first time that we tried to bring it, we did not ask Yahweh how we should carry it {it should be carried}. You
\add descendants of Levi\add* were not the ones who carried it, so Yahweh our God punished us.”
\p
\v 14 Then the priests and the descendants of Levi \add performed the rituals
to\add* purify themselves, in order that it would be proper for them to do the work of carrying the Sacred Chest of Yahweh, the
God of us Israeli people. 
\v 15 The descendants of Levi \add fastened\add* poles to the Sacred Chest so that they could carry the Sacred Chest by
\add fastening\add* poles \add to it and carrying it\add* on their shoulders, like Moses had commanded, and like Yahweh had
said that they should. 
\p
\v 16 David told the leaders of the descendants of Levi to appoint some of their relatives to sing and play lyres, harps, and
cymbals, and to sing joyful songs \add while they were carrying the Sacred
Chest\add*. 
\p
\v 17 So they appointed Heman and his relatives Asaph and Ethan. Heman was the son of Joel; Asaph was the son of Berekiah.
Ethan, a descendant of Merari, was Kushaiah's son. 
\v 18 There was also another group of descendants of Levi who were appointed: Zechariah, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni,
Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, and two of the temple gatekeepers: Obed-Edom and Jeiel.
\p
\v 19 Heman, Asaph and Ethan sang, but also played bronze cymbals.
\v 20 Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah played lyres.
\v 21 Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-Edom, Jeiel and Azaziah played harps.
\v 22 Kenaniah, the leader of the descendants of Levi, directed the singing because he was very capable of doing that.
\p
\v 23 Berekiah and Elkanah were two of the men who guarded the Sacred Chest.
\v 24 The priests Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer were appointed to blow trumpets in
front of the Sacred Chest. Obed-Edom and Jehiah also guarded the Sacred Chest.
\p
\v 25 David and the Israeli leaders and the officers who commanded 1,000 soldiers went to get the Sacred Chest. They went to
bring it from Obed-Edom's house. They went very joyfully. 
\v 26 God helped the descendants of Levi who carried the Sacred Chest of Yahweh; therefore David and the leaders sacrificed
seven bulls and seven ◄rams\f + \ft Or: male \f* sheep► \add to thank him\add*. 
\v 27 All the descendants of Levi who carried the Sacred Chest, Kenaniah, the man who directed those who sang, all wore robes
of fine white linen and sacred vests made of fine linen. David also wore a sacred vest made of white linen.
\v 28 So all the of Israeli people joined in bringing the Sacred Chest up
\add to Jerusalem\add*. They shouted, blew horns and trumpets, and played cymbals, lyres, and harps.
\p
\v 29 While they were bringing the Sacred Chest into Jerusalem, Saul's daughter Michal watched them, looking out of a window.
When she saw King David dancing and celebrating, she despised him.
