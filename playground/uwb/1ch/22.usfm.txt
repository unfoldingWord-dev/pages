\c 22  
\p
\v 1 Then David said, “Here, \add at the edge of Jerusalem\add*, is where
\add we will build\add* the temple for our God Yahweh, and where
\add we will make\add* the altar for burning the offerings that the Israeli
\add people will bring\add*.” 
\s The preparations for the temple 
\p
\v 2 So David commanded that the foreigners who lived in Israel must gather together.
\add When they did that\add*, he appointed \add some of those\add* men to
\add cut huge\add* stones \add from the quarries\add* and to smooth their surfaces, to be used to build the temple of God.
\v 3 David provided a large amount of iron for making nails and hinges for the doors in the gates of the temple. He also
provided a huge amount of bronze \add for making various utensils\add*;
\add and because there was a huge amount of it\add*, no one could weigh it all.
\v 4 He also provided \add money for buying\add* a large amount of cedar logs. Because there was a huge number of them, no one
counted them. Those were logs that men from Tyre and Sidon \add cities\add* sent to David.
\p
\v 5 David \add provided all those things because he thought\add*, “My son Solomon is still young and he does not know what he
needs to know \add about building buildings\add*, and the temple of Yahweh must be magnificent\f + \ft Or: very \f* beautiful. It must be a
glorious building that will become famous, and people throughout the world must consider it to be glorious\f + \ft Or: splendid \f*. So now I
will begin to prepare for it to be built, \add and Solomon will be responsible for finishing
it\add*.” So David collected a great amount of building materials before he died.
\p
\v 6 Then David summoned his son Solomon, and told him that he should arrange for a temple to be built for Yahweh, the God whom
the Israelis \add worshiped\add*. 
\v 7 He said to him, “I wanted [IDI] to build a temple to honor \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* Yahweh, my God.
\v 8 But Yahweh told \add a prophet to\add* tell me, ‘You have killed many men \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* in the big battles that you have fought. I
have seen the blood of all the people whom you killed, so you will not be the one who will arrange for a temple to be built to
honor me \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f*. 
\v 9 But you will have a son \add who will be king of Israel after you
die\add*. He will be a man who is peaceful and quiet, \add not a man who kills
others\add*. And I will cause that there will be peace between him and his enemies who are in all the nearby lands. His name
will be Solomon, \add which sounds like the word for peace\add*. During the time that he is king, people in Israel will be
peaceful and safe. 
\v 10 He is the one who will arrange for a temple to be built to honor me \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f*. He will be
\add like\add* a son to me, and I will cause some of his descendants to rule \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* over Israel forever \\f + \\ft hyperbole \\f*.’
\p
\v 11 So now, my son, I hope\f + \ft Or: wish \f* that Yahweh will help you, and enable you to be successful in arranging for building the
temple of Yahweh, your God, which is what he said that you would do.
\v 12 I also hope\f + \ft Or: wish \f* that he will enable you to be wise and to understand what you need to know, and enable you to obey his
laws while you rule over Israel. 
\v 13 If you carefully obey all the laws and regulations\f + \ft Or: commands \f* that Yahweh gave to Moses to give to us Israeli people, you
will be successful. So be steadfast\f + \ft Or: strong \f* and courageous. Do not be afraid of anything, and do not become discouraged!
\p
\v 14 I have tried hard to provide \add materials for building\add* the temple of Yahweh. I have provided nearly 4,000 tons of
gold, and nearly 40,000 tons of silver. I have also provided a very large amount of iron and bronze; no one has been able to
weigh it all. I have also gathered\f + \ft Or: provided \f* lumber and stone \add for the walls of the
temple\add*, but you may need to get some more of those things. 
\v 15 There are many men \add in Israel\add* who have good ability to cut big stones for making stone walls, and carpenters,
and men who are very skilled at making various kinds of things. 
\v 16 There are many men who know how to make things from gold and silver and bronze and iron. So now
\add I say to you\add*, begin the work \add of building the temple\add*, and I hope\f + \ft Or: wish \f* that Yahweh will help\f + \ft Or: be \f* with you.”
\p
\v 17 Then David commanded that all the Israeli leaders must assist Solomon. He said to them,
\v 18 “Yahweh our God is certainly with\f + \ft Or: helping \f* you \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f*. He has allowed you to have peace with all the nearby nations \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f*.
He has enabled my \add army\add* to conquer [IDI] them, so now Yahweh and my people control them.
\v 19 Now you must obey Yahweh with your entire inner beings. Help Solomon to arrange for building the temple for Yahweh God,
in order that you can bring the chest that contains the Ten Commandments and the other sacred items that belong to God into the
temple that you will build to honor Yahweh.”
