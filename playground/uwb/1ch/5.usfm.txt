\s2 The descendants of Reuben 
\p
\v 1 Reuben was the oldest son of Jacob. Therefore, he should have received the special rights\f + \ft Or: privileges \f* that belonged to
firstborn sons. But he had sex with his father's slave wife. So \add his
father\add* gave those rights to the sons of his son Joseph. And in the family records, Reuben is not mentioned first, like the
firstborn sons always are. 
\v 2 Judah became more influential than his brothers, and a ruler of Judah descended from him. So Joseph's family received the
rights that belonged to firstborn sons. 
\v 3 But Reuben was Jacob's oldest son. Reuben's sons were Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.
\li
\v 4  \add Another descendant of Reuben was Joel\add*. 
\li2 Joel's son was Shemaiah. Shemaiah's son was Gog. Gog's son was Shimei.
\li2
\v 5 Shimei's son was Micah. Micah's son was Reaiah. Reaiah's son was Baal.
\li2
\v 6 Baal's son was Beerah. Beerah was a leader of the tribe\f + \ft Or: descendants \f* of Reuben. But Tiglath-Pileser the king of Assyria
captured him and took him to Assyria. 
\li
\v 7 The names of these clans are listed here according to what is written in their family records.
\li2 The first \add name written was\add* Jeiel. Then Zechariah,
\v 8 and then Bela. But Bela was the son of Azaz, and Azaz was the son of Shema, and Shema was the son of Joel. That clan lived
near Aroer \add city\add* as far \add north\add* as Nebo \add town\add* and Baal-Meon
\add city\add*. 
\v 9 Bela's clan lived further east, as far as the edge of the desert
\add south of\add* the Euphrates River. \add They went there\add* because they had a huge amount of cattle,
\add with the result that there was not enough pastureland for them\add* in the Gilead
\add region\add*. 
\li2
\v 10 When Saul was king \add of Israel\add*, Bela's clan fought against the descendants of Hagar and defeated them. After
that, Bela's clan lived in the tents that the descendants of Hagar had lived in previously, in all the area east of the Gilead
\add region\add*. 
\s2 The descendants of Gad 
\li
\v 11 The tribe of Gad lived near the tribe of Reuben; they lived in the Bashan
\add region\add*, all the way \add east\add* to Salecah \add town\add*.
\v 12 Joel was their chief; Shapham was his assistant; other leaders were Janai and Shaphat.
\li
\v 13 Other members of the tribe belonged to seven clans, whose leaders were Michael, Meshullam, Sheba, Jorai, Jacan, Zia, and
Eber. 
\v 14 They were descendants of Abihail. Abihail was Huri's son. Huri was Jaroah's son. Jaroah was Gilead's son. Gilead was
Michael's son. Michael was Jeshishai's son. Jeshishai was Jahdo's son. Jahdo was the son of Buz.
\li2
\v 15 Ahi was Abdiel's son. Abdiel was Guni's son. Ahi was the leader of their clan.
\li
\v 16 The descendants of Gad lived in the towns of Gilead and Bashan regions, and on all the pastureland on the Sharon
\add plain\add*. 
\v 17 All of those names were written in the records of the clans of Gad during the time that Jotham was the king of Judah and
Jeroboam was the king of Israel. 
\s2 The armies of the tribes that lived east of the Jordan River
\p
\v 18 There were 44,760 soldiers from the tribes of Reuben and Gad and
\add the eastern\add* half of the tribe of Manasseh. They all carried shields and swords and bows
\add and arrows\add*. They \add were all trained to\add* fight well in battles.
\v 19 They attacked the descendants of Hagar and the people of Jetur, Naphish, and Nodab
\add cities\add*. 
\v 20 The men from those three tribes prayed to God during the battles, requesting him to help them. So he helped them, because
they trusted in him. He enabled them to defeat [IDI] the descendants of Hagar and all those who were helping them.
\v 21 They took the animals that belonged to the descendants of Hagar: they took 50,000 camels, 250,000 sheep, and 2,000
donkeys. They also captured 100,000 people. 
\v 22 But many descendants of Hagar were killed because God helped the people of the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh. After
that, those three tribes lived in that area until \add the army of\add* Babylonia
\add captured them and\add* took them away to Babylon. 
\s2 The eastern half of the tribe of Manasseh 
\p
\v 23 There were many people who belonged to the eastern half of the tribe of Manasseh. They lived in the Bashan
\add region east of the Jordan River\add*, as far \add north\add* as Baal-Hermon, Senir, and Hermon Mountain.
\p
\v 24 Their clan leaders were Epher, Ishi, Eliel, Azriel, Jeremiah, Hodaviah, and Jahdiel. They were all strong, brave, and
famous soldiers, and leaders of their clans. 
\v 25 But they sinned against God, the one whom their ancestors had worshiped. They began to worship the gods\f + \ft Or: idols \f* that the
people of that region had worshiped, the people whom God had enabled them to destroy!
\v 26 So the God whom the Israelis \add worshiped\add* incited Pul, the king of Assyria, to want to conquer those tribes. Pul's
other name was Tiglath-Pileser. His \add army\add* captured the people of the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the eastern half of
the tribe of Manasseh, and took them to \add various places in Assyria\add*: Halah, Habor, Hara and near the Gozan River.
\add They have lived in those places from that time\add* to the present time.
