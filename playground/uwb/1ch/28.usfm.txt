\s David's instructions to Solomon for building the temple 
\p
\v 1 David summoned all the leaders of Israel to come to Jerusalem. He summoned the leaders of the tribes, the
leaders\f + \ft Or: commanders \f* of the groups that worked for the king, the commanders of 100 soldiers, and the commanders of 1,000
soldiers, and those who were in charge of the king's property, his livestock, those who taught his sons, all the palace
officials, and his mighty soldiers and bravest warriors. 
\p
\v 2 David stood up and said, “My fellow Israelis, listen to me. I wanted [IDI] to build a temple to be a place where we would
put the Sacred Chest of Yahweh, where it would stay permanently. And I made plans to build it.
\v 3 But God said to me, ‘You are not the one who will \add arrange
to\add* build a temple for me \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f*, because you are a warrior and you have killed many people \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f*
\add in battles\add*.’ 
\p
\v 4 But Yahweh, the God to whom we Israelis belong, had chosen me and my descendants to be the kings of Israel forever.
\add First\add* he chose the tribe of Judah, and from the people \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* of Judah he chose my family, and from my father's sons
he chose me to be the king over all of Israel. 
\v 5 Yahweh has given me many sons, but from them he chose my son Solomon to be the next king to rule \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* his kingdom of
Israel. 
\v 6 He said to me, ‘Solomon your son is the one who will \add arrange
to\add* build my temple and the courtyards around it, because I have chosen him to be
\add like\add* my son and I will be \add like\add* \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* his father.
\v 7 I will enable his kingdom to endure forever if he continues to obey my laws and commands, like you are doing now.’
\p
\v 8 So now, while all you \add people of Israel\add*, all of you who belong to Yahweh, are watching, and while God is
listening, I command you \add leaders\add* to carefully obey all the commands of Yahweh our God, in order that you may continue
to possess this good land, and enable your descendants to inherit it forever.
\p
\v 9 And you, my son Solomon, must know God like I know him, and you must serve him faithfully and because you want to. You
must do that because he knows what everyone is thinking and he understands the reasons that people do what they do. If you seek
\add to know\add* him, he will heed your prayers. But if you abandon\f + \ft Or: reject \f* him, he will abandon\f + \ft Or: reject \f* you forever.
\v 10 Yahweh has chosen you to \add arrange to\add* build a temple for him. So think about
\add what I have said\add*, and be strong and do what \add he is wanting you to
do\add*.” 
\p
\v 11 Then David gave to his son Solomon \add the scroll on which were
written\add* the plans for the main rooms of the temple, its porch, its storerooms, all the other upper and lower rooms, and
the very holy place where God forgive the sins that people have committed.
\v 12 David wrote for him the plans that God's Spirit had put into his mind for building the courtyards and all the rooms that
surrounded the temple, including the room where the money and other valuable things that were dedicated to God were kept.
\v 13 He gave Solomon instructions for the groups of priests and other descendants of Levi, about all the work that they must
do to serve in Yahweh's temple, and about taking care of all the things that would be used in the work at the temple.
\v 14 He wrote down how much gold and how much silver should be used to make all the items in the temple:
\v 15 how much gold for making the gold lampstands and the lamps, and how much silver to make the silver lamps and lampstands,
\v 16 how much gold for making the table on which \add the priests would
put\add* the sacred bread, how much silver to make the other tables,
\v 17 how much pure gold for the meat forks and the bowls and the cups, how much gold for each gold dish and now much silver
for each silver dish; 
\v 18 and how much pure gold to make the altar for \add burning\add* incense. He also gave to Solomon his plans for making the
golden statues of winged creatures that would be above the Sacred Chest of Yahweh,
\add like\add* a chariot for him. 
\p
\v 19 Then David said, “I have written \add all these plans\add* while Yahweh was directing \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* me. He has enabled me to
understand all the details of his plan \add for the temple that is to be
built\add*.” 
\p
\v 20 David also said to his son Solomon, “Be strong and courageous, and do this work. Do not be afraid or discouraged, because
Yahweh our God will be with\f + \ft Or: helping \f* you. He will not fail \add to
help\add* you or abandon you until you finish all the work of making the temple of his.
\v 21 The groups of priests and \add other\add* descendants of Levi are ready to begin their work at the temple, and every man
who has a special skill will help you in all the work. And my officials and the other people will obey you, whatever you
command them to do.”
