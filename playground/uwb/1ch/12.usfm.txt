\s Some warriors joined David 
\p
\v 1 David went to Ziklag \add town\add* to escape from \add King\add* Saul. While he was there, many warriors came and joined
him, and they helped him when he fought battles. 
\v 2 They carried bows \add and arrows\add*. They were able to shoot arrows and to sling stones. They could use either their
right arms or their left arms to do that. They were relatives of Saul from the tribe of Benjamin.
\p
\v 3 Their leader was Ahiezer. Next in command was Joash. They were both sons of Shemaah from Gibeah
\add city\add*. \add These are the names of some of those warriors\add*:
\li Jeziel and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth; 
\li Beracah; 
\li Jehu from Anathoth \add town\add*; 
\li
\v 4 Ishmaiah from the Gibeon \add city\add*, who was the leader of the thirty greatest warriors;
\li Jeremiah, Jahaziel, Johanan, and Jozabad from Gederah \add town\add*;
\li
\v 5 Eluzai, Jerimoth, Bealiah, Shemariah, and Shephatiah from Haruph
\add town\add*; 
\li
\v 6 Elkanah, Isshiah, Azarel, Joezer and Jashobeam, who were descendants of Korah;
\li
\v 7 Joelah and Zebadiah, who were sons of Jeroham, from Gedor \add town\add*.
\p
\v 8 Some men from the tribe of Gad \add east of the Jordan River\add* joined David when he was at his fortress in
\add the caves in\add* the desert. They were brave warriors who were trained for fighting battles and able to use shields and
spears well. They \f + \ft synecdoche \f* were as fierce as [SIM, MTY] lions, and they could run as fast as [HYP, SIM] deer\f + \ft Or: gazelles \f* on the
hills\f + \ft Or: mountains \f*. 
\li
\v 9 Ezer was their leader. 
\li Next in command was Obadiah. 
\li Next was Eliab. 
\li
\v 10 Next was Mishmannah. 
\li Next was Jeremiah. 
\li
\v 11 Next was Attai. 
\li Next was Eliel. 
\li
\v 12 Next was Johanan. 
\li Next was Elzabad. 
\li
\v 13 Next was \add another man whose name was\add* Jeremiah. 
\li The last was Macbannai. 
\p
\v 14 Those men from the tribe of Gad were all army officers. Some of them commanded 1000 soldiers, and some of them commanded
100 soldiers. 
\v 15 They crossed \add to the west side of\add* the Jordan \add River\add* during March,
\add at the time of the year\add* when the river was flooded. They chased from there all the people who lived in the valleys on
both sides of the river. 
\p
\v 16 Some other men from the tribe of Benjamin and from Judah also came to David in his fortress.
\v 17 David went out \add of the cave\add* to meet them and said to them, “If you have come peacefully to help me, I am eager
to have to join with me. But if you have come to enable my enemies to capture me, even though I \f + \ft synecdoche \f* have not done anything to
harm you, I hope\f + \ft Or: wish \f* that the God whom our ancestors worshiped\f + \ft Or: belonged \f* to will see it and condemn\f + \ft Or: punish \f* you.”
\p
\v 18 Then \add God's\add* Spirit came upon Amasai, who was the leader of the thirty
\add greatest warriors\add*, and he said, 
\q David, we want to be with you; 
\q2 you who are the son of Jesse, we will join you. 
\q We know that things will go very well \f + \ft doublet \f* for you and for those who are with you,
\q2 because your God is helping you. 
\p
\v 19 So David welcomed those men, and he appointed them to be leaders of his soldiers. Some men from the tribe of Manasseh
also joined David when he went with the soldiers of Philistia to fight against Saul's
\add army\add*. But David and his men did not really help the army of Philistia. After the leaders of Philistia talked about
\add David and his soldiers\add*, they sent David away. They said, “If David joins his master Saul again, we will all be killed
{his army will kill all of us}!” 
\v 20 When David went to Ziklag, these were the men from the tribe of Manasseh who went with him: Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael,
Michael, \add another man whose name was\add* Jozabad, Elihu, and Zillethai. Each of them had been a commander of 1,000 men
\add in Saul's army\add*. 
\v 21 They were all brave soldiers, and they helped David to fight against the groups of men who roamed throughout the country,
robbing people. So those men became commanders in David's army. 
\v 22 Every day more men joined David's men, and his army became large, like \f + \ft simile \f* the army of God [OR, a very huge army].
\s Others joined David at Hebron 
\p
\v 23 These are the numbers of soldiers who were ready for battle who joined David at Hebron
\add city\add*. They came to help him to become the king of Israel instead of Saul, as Yahweh had promised would happen:
\li
\v 24 There were 6,800 men from Judah, who carried shields and spears.
\li
\v 25 There were 7,100 men from the tribe of Simeon. They were all strong warriors trained to fight battles.
\li
\v 26 There were 4,600 men from the tribe of Levi. 
\li2
\v 27 Jehoiada, who was a leader descended from Aaron, was in that group of descendants of Levi, and there were 3,700 men with
him. 
\li2
\v 28 Zadok, a strong young soldier, was also in that group, and there were 22 other leaders from his clan who came with him.
\li
\v 29 There were 3,000 men from the tribe of Benjamin who were Saul's relatives. Most of them had previously wanted one of
Saul's descendants to be the king. 
\li
\v 30 There were 20,800 men from the tribe of Ephraim who were all brave warriors and trained for fighting battles, and famous
in their own clans. 
\li
\v 31 There were 18,000 men from the half of the tribe of Manasseh
\add that lived west of the Jordan River\add*. They were all chosen to go and help David become the king.
\li
\v 32 There were 200 men who were leaders from the tribe of Issachar. They always knew what the Israelis should do, and they
knew the right time to do it. Their relatives were with them, commanded by their leaders.
\li
\v 33 There were 55,000 men from the tribe of Zebulun. They were all experienced warriors and knew how to use all kinds of
weapons well. They were completely loyal to David. 
\li
\v 34 There were 1,000 officers from the tribe of Naphtali. With them were 37,000 soldiers, each carrying shields and spears.
\li
\v 35 There were 28,600 soldiers from the tribe of Dan, who were trained to fight battles.
\li
\v 36 There were 47,000 experienced soldiers from the tribe of Asher, all trained to fight battles.
\li
\v 37 There were also 120,000 soldiers from the area east of the Jordan
\add River who joined David\add*. They were from the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the eastern half of the tribe of Manasseh. They
also had \add all kinds of\add* weapons. 
\p
\v 38 All those men were soldiers who volunteered to be in David's army. They came to Hebron wanting very much to enable David
to be the king of all of the Israeli people. 
\v 39 The men spent three days there with David, eating and drinking, because their families had given them food to take with
them. 
\v 40 Also, their fellow Israelis came from as far away as the area where the tribes of Issachar, Zebulun, and Naphtali lived,
bringing food on donkeys, camels, mules, and oxen. They brought a lot of flour, fig cakes, raisins, wine, olive oil, cattle and
sheep. And throughout Israel, the people were very joyful.
