\c 17  
\s Yahweh's promise to David 
\p
\v 1 After David began to live in his palace, he said to the prophet Nathan,
“\add It does not seem right that\add* I am here living in a palace made of cedar
\add wood\add*, but Yahweh's Sacred Chest is kept inside a tent!”
\p
\v 2 Nathan replied to David, “Whatever you are thinking about doing, do it, because God is with/guiding you.”
\pi
\v 3 But that night God spoke \f + \fr metonymy \f* to Nathan. He said, 
\v 4 “Go and tell my servant David that this is what I, Yahweh, am saying to him: 'You are not the one who should build a
temple for me to live in. 
\v 5 I have not lived in any building, from the day that I brought the people of Israel up
\add out of Egypt\add* until now. Instead, I have \add lived in a
tent\add*, moving from one place to another when \add the Israelis\add* moved to other places \f + \fr doublet \f*.
\v 6 Wherever I went with all the Israelis \add as they traveled\add*, I never \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* said to any of their leaders whom I
appointed to lead \f + \fr metaphor \f* them, ‘Why have you not built me a temple made of cedar
\add wood\add*?’ 
\pi
\v 7 Therefore, this is what you should say to my servant David: ‘I, the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels, took you
from a pasture where you were taking care of sheep, and I \add appointed
you\add* to be the ruler of my Israeli people. 
\v 8 I have ◄been with/helped► you wherever you have gone, and I have gotten rid of all your enemies who were in front of you.
And now I will cause you to become very famous, as well-known as the names of the greatest men
\add who have ever lived on\add* the earth. 
\v 9-10 Formerly, during the time that I appointed leaders for my Israeli people, many violent groups oppressed them. But this
will not happen anymore. I have chosen a place where my Israeli people can live
\add peacefully\add* and no one will disturb them any more. I will give them rest from
\add being attacked by\add* their enemies. And I will defeat all your enemies.
\pi I declare to you that I, Yahweh, will enable your descendants to rule after you
\add die\add*. 
\v 11 When your life ends, and you \add die and\add* \f + \fr euphemism \f* go to be with your ancestors, I will appoint one of your sons to
become king, and I will enable his kingdom to ◄be strong/resist all their enemies►.
\v 12 He is the one who will \add arrange for\add* a temple to be built for me. And I will enable his descendants to be kings
\f + \fr metonymy \f* of Israel forever. 
\v 13 I will be \add like\add* a father to him, and \add it will be as
though\add* he is a son to me. I stopped loving \add Saul\add*, the one who was the king before you became king, but I will
never stop loving your son. 
\v 14 I will cause him to rule over my people \f + \fr metonymy \f*, and his kingdom will endure forever \f + \fr doublet \f*.’ ”
\p
\v 15 So Nathan reported to David everything that Yahweh had revealed to him.
\s David's prayer 
\p
\v 16 Then David went into \add the Sacred Tent\add* and sat in the presence of Yahweh, and prayed this:
\pi “Yahweh my God, I am certainly not \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* worthy for you to have done of all these things for me, and my family is not
worthy, either. 
\pi
\v 17 And O God, now, in addition to everything else, you have spoken about what will happen to my descendants in the future
for many generations. Yahweh my God, you have acted toward me as though I was the most important man
\add on the earth\add*! 
\pi
\v 18 What more can I, David, say to you \add for honoring me\add*? Although you know very well what I am like,
\v 19 Yahweh, for my sake and because it is what you wanted to do, you have done these great things
\add for me\add*, and you have revealed to me these things \add that you are promising to
do\add*. 
\pi
\v 20 Yahweh, you are great. There is no one like you. Only you are God, which is what we have always heard.
\v 21 And there is no nation in the world like Israel \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*. Israel is the only nation on the earth whose people you went out
to rescue. You performed great and awesome miracles, rescuing our ancestors from
\add being slaves\add* in Egypt, expelling the people of other people-groups
\add who were in Canaan\add*. 
\v 22 You have caused us your Israeli people to belong to you forever, and you, Yahweh, have become our God!
\pi
\v 23 And now Yahweh, I pray that you will cause the things that you have promised about me and my descendants \f + \fr metonymy \f* to be
fulfilled forever, and do the things that you have said \add that you would
do\add*. 
\v 24 When that happens, you \f + \fr metonymy \f* will be famous forever. And people will exclaim, ‘The Almighty Commander of the armies of
angels, is the God who rules Israel!’ And you will cause that forever there will be descendants \f + \fr metonymy \f* of mine who will rule.
\pi
\v 25 You, my God, have revealed to me that you will cause \add some
of\add* my descendants to become kings. So I am brave enough to pray like this to you.
\v 26 Yahweh, you are God! You have promised to do these good things for me.
\v 27 And now you, Yahweh, have \add promised to\add* bless my descendants \f + \fr metonymy \f*, in order that they will continue to rule
forever. That will happen because you, Yahweh, are the one who has blessed them, and you will keep blessing them forever.”
