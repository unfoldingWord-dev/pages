\s The duties that David assigned to the musicians 
\p
\v 1 David and some of the temple officials \f + \fr (OR, army commanders) \f* chose some of the descendants of Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun
to be in charge of the preaching, and to play harps and lyres and cymbals. This is a list of the men whom they chose for that
work: 
\m
\v 2 From the sons of Asaph they chose Zaccur, Joseph, Nethaniah, and Aserelah. Asaph supervised them. And the king appointed
Asaph to preach. 
\m
\v 3 From the sons of Jeduthun they chose six men: Gedaliah, Zeri, Jeshaiah, Shimei, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah. Jeduthun
supervised them and also preached, playing his harp while he thanked and praised Yahweh.
\m
\v 4 From the sons of Heman they chose Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shubael, Jerimoth, Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah, Giddalti,
Romamti-Ezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, and Mahazioth. 
\p
\v 5 They were all sons of Heman, who was King David's prophet. God promised to cause Heman to be strong, so altogether, God
have him fourteen sons and three daughters. 
\p
\v 6 All those men were supervised by their fathers while they played music in the temple of Yahweh. They played cymbals,
lyres, and harps. And their fathers — Asaph Jeduthun and Heman — were supervised by the king.
\v 7 Those men and their relatives were all trained and skilled for playing musical instruments in the temple. That was their
work for Yahweh. Including their relatives, there were 288 of them.
\v 8 All of them, including ones who were young and those who were old, cast lots to determine what work they would do.
