\s The battle against the Ammon people-group 
\p
\v 1 Some time later, Nahash, the king of the Ammon people-group, died. Then his son Hanun became their king.
\v 2  \add When David heard about that\add*, he thought \add to himself\add*, “Nahash was kind to me, so I will be kind to his
son.” So David sent some officials there, to tell Hanun that he was sorry to hear that Hanun's father
\add had died\add*. 
\p But when David's officials came to Hanun in the land where the Ammon people-group lived,
\v 3 the leaders of the Ammon people-group said to Hanun, “Do you think that David is really to honor your father that King
David is sending these men to say that he is sorry that your father died?
\add We think that\add* his men have come to ◄look around\f + \ft Or: spy \f*► our city in order to determine how
\add his army\add* can conquer us.” 
\p
\v 4 Hanun \add believed what they said\add*; so he \add commanded some
soldiers\add* who seized the officials whom David had sent, and shaved off their beads, and
\add insulted them by\add* cutting off the lower part of their robes, and then sent them away.
\p
\v 5 The officials were greatly humiliated\f + \ft Or: ashamed \f*. When David found out about what had happened to his officials, he sent some
messengers to them to tell them, “Stay at Jericho until your beards have grown again, and then return home.”
\p
\v 6 Then the \add leaders of the\add* Ammon people-group realized that they had greatly insulted [IDI] David. So Hanun and
some of his officials sent about ◄37,000 pounds\f + \ft Or: 34 \f*,000 kg.► of silver to hire chariots and chariot-drivers from the
Aram-Naharaim, Aram-Maacah and Zobah \add regions northeast of Israel\add*.
\v 7 They hired 32,000 chariots and chariot-drivers, as well as the Kings of the Maacah and Tob
\add regions\add* and their armies. They came and set up their tents near Medeba
\add town in Moab region\add*. The soldiers from the Ammon \add people-group\add* also marched out and ◄stood in their
positions\f + \ft Or: arranged \f* themselves for battle► at the entrance to \add their capital city,
Rabbah\add*. 
\p
\v 8 When David heard about that, he sent Joab and all his army.
\v 9 The soldiers of the Ammon people-group came out of their city and lined up for battle at the entrance to their city.
Meanwhile, the other kings who had come \add with their armies\add* stood in their positions in the open fields.
\p
\v 10 Joab saw that there were groups of enemy soldiers in front of his troops and behind his troops. So he selected some of
the best Israeli troops and put them in positions to fight against the soldiers of Syria.
\v 11 He appointed his \add older\add* brother Abishai to be the commander of his other soldiers and he told them to ◄stand in
their positions\f + \ft Or: arrange \f* themselves► in front of \add the army of\add* the Ammon people-group.
\v 12 Joab said to them, “If the soldiers from Syria are too strong for us to defeat them, then your soldiers must come and
help us. But if the soldiers from the Ammon people-group are too strong for you to defeat them, then my soldiers will come and
help your men. 
\v 13 We must be strong\f + \ft Or: courageous \f*, and fight hard to \add defend\add* our people and our cities ◄that belong to\f + \ft Or: where \f* we
worship► our God. I will pray that Yahweh will do what he considers to be good.”
\p
\v 14 So Joab and his troops \add advanced to\add* fight the army of Syria, and the soldiers from Syria ran away from them.
\v 15 And when the soldiers of the Ammon people-group saw that the soldiers from Syria were running away, they also started to
run away from Abishai and his army, and they retreated back inside the city. So Joab
\add and his army\add* returned to Jerusalem. 
\p
\v 16 After the leaders of the army of Syria realized that they had been defeated by
\add the army of\add* Israel, they sent messengers to \add another part of
Syria\add* on the east side of the \add Euphrates\add* river, and brought troops from there
\add to the battle area\add*, with Shophach, the commander of Hadadezer's army, leading them.
\p
\v 17 When David heard about that, he gathered all the Israeli soldiers, and they crossed the Jordan
\add River\add*. They advanced and took their battle positions to attack the army of Syria.
\v 18 But the army of Syria ran away from the soldiers of Israel. However, David's soldiers killed 7,000 of their
chariot-drivers and 40,000 other soldiers. They also killed Shophach, their army commander.
\p
\v 19 When the kings who had been ruled by Hadadezer realized that they had been defeated by the Israeli army, they made peace
with David, and agreed to allow him to rule them. 
\p So the rulers of Syria did not want to help the rulers of the Ammon people-group anymore.
