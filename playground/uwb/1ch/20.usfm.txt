\s David's army captured the capital city of Ammon 
\p
\v 1  \add In that region\add*, kings usually went \add with their
armies\add* to fight \add their enemies\add* ◄in the springtime/when the cold season ended►. But the following year,
\add David did not do that. Instead\add*, he stayed in Jerusalem, and he sent
\add his commander\add* Joab \add to lead the army\add*. Joab took his troops. They
\add crossed the Jordan River and\add* ruined the land of the Ammon people-group. Then they went to Rabbah,
\add the capital city\add*, and surrounded it. But David stayed in Jerusalem
\add for a while. But later he took more troops and went to help\add* Joab. Their armies attacked Rabbah and destroyed it.
\v 2 Then David took the crown from the head of the king of Rabbah (OR, from the head of their god Milcom) and put it on his
own head. It \add was very heavy\add*; it weighed ◄75 pounds/34 kg.►, and it had many very valuable stones
\add fastened to it\add*. They also took many other valuable things from the city.
\v 3 Then they brought the people out of the city and forced them to
\add work for their army\add*, using saws and iron picks and axes. David's soldiers did this in all the cities of the Ammon
people-group. Then David and all of his army returned to Jerusalem.
\s Wars against the giants in Philistia 
\p
\v 4 Later, \add David's army\add* fought a battle with the army of Philistia, at Gezer
\add city\add*. During the battle Sibbecai, from Hushah \add clan\add*, killed Sippai, one of the descendants of the of the
Rapha \add giants\add*. So the armies of Philistia were defeated.
\p
\v 5 In another battle against the soldiers of Philistia, Elhanan, the son of Jair, killed Lahmi, the
\add younger\add* brother of \add the giant\add* Goliath from Gath
\add town\add*, who had a spear which was as thick as a weaver's rod.
\p
\v 6 In there was another battle near Gath. There was a ◄huge man/giant► there who had six fingers on each hand and six toes on
each foot. He was descended from the Rapha \add giants\add*. 
\v 7 When he made fun of the soldiers of Israel, Jonathan, the son of David's
\add older\add* brother Shimea, killed him. 
\p
\v 8 Those were some of the descendants of the Rapha \add giants\add* who had lived in Gath, who were killed \f + \fr metonymy \f* by David and
his soldiers.
