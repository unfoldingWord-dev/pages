\c 4  
\s 1 Peter 4:1-6 
\s Think as Christ did when he suffered, and conduct your lives as God wants you to, not doing the immoral things that you used
to do. 
\p
\v 1 Therefore, because Christ suffered in his body, you also must think the way that he did
\add when he was willing to suffer\add*, because those who suffer in their bodies
\add because of belonging to Jesus\add* have stopped sinning \add the way they used to
sin\add*. 
\v 2 As a result, during their remaining time here on earth, they do not do the things that sinful people desire to do, but
instead they do the things that God wants them to do. 
\v 3  \add I say that to you\add* because \f + \ft sarcasm \f* you have already spent too much of your time
\add here on earth\add* doing what the people who do not know God like to do. In the past you committed all kinds of sexually
immoral acts \f + \ft doublet \f*, you got drunk and then participated in orgies\f + \ft Or: wild parties \f* and carousing, Or: revelry, and you
\add worshipped\add* idols, which is very displeasing to God. 
\v 4  \add Because you used to do those things\add*, \add your friends\add* are surprised that you do not join with them
anymore when they participate in that kind of wild behavior \add that\add*
\add is rushing to\f + \ft Or: will quickly\add* \f* \add destroy them like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* a flood. As a result, they speak evil about you.
\v 5 But \add God\add* is ready to judge the people who are living
\add now\add* and the people who have died, and he is the one who will decide whether he approves of what they have done.
\v 6 That is the reason why the message \add about Christ\add* was preached
{\add people\add* preached the message \add about Christ\add*} to believers who have now died.
\add That message was preached to them\add* in order that even though
\add sinful\add* people might judge them \add and say that they are
guilty\add*, God's Spirit would \add enable them to\add* live \add eternally\add*.
\s 1 Peter 4:7-11 
\s Keep thinking sensibly. Love each other earnestly. Provide hospitality to others. Use your spiritual gifts well. Do kind
deeds with all the energy that you have. 
\p
\v 7 It is almost the time when all things on this earth will come to an end. Therefore, keep thinking sensibly\f + \ft Or: reasonably \f* and
control what you think \f + \ft doublet \f*, so that you can pray \add clearly\add*.
\v 8 Most important of all, love each other earnestly\f + \ft Or: wholeheartedly \f*, because if we love others \f + \ft personification \f*, we will just ignore many
of the sinful things that \add they do to us\add*. 
\v 9 Provide food and a place to sleep for those \add who come to your
community\add*, \add and do it\add* without complaining. 
\v 10 Believers should all use the spiritual gifts that God has given them to serve others. They should manage\f + \ft Or: use \f* well the
various gifts that God has kindly given them. 
\v 11 Those who speak \add to the congregation\add* should do that as though they are speaking the
\add very\add* words of God. Those who do kind deeds to others should do it with the strength that God gives them, in order
that God may be honored by all this {that all this may honor God} as Jesus Christ
\add enables us to do it. I pray that we will\add* praise \add God\add* \f + \ft Or:
\add Jesus\add* \f* and give him the authority \add to rule over us\add* forever. May it be so!\f + \ft Or: Amen! \f*
\s 1 Peter 4:12-19 
\s Do not be surprised about your sufferings for being Christians, and do not be ashamed when that happens. Instead, commit
yourselves to God. 
\p
\v 12 You whom I love, do not be surprised about the painful things that you are suffering
\add because you belong to Christ\add*. \add Those\add* things are
\add testing you as metals are tested by people putting them\add* in a fire. Do not think that something strange is happening
to you. 
\v 13 Instead, rejoice that you are suffering the same kinds of things that Christ endured. Rejoice
when\add you suffer\add*, in order that you may also be very glad \f + \ft doublet \f* when Christ returns and reveals how glorious\f + \ft Or: wonderful \f*
he is. 
\v 14 If you are insulted {If \add people\add* insult you} because you believe in Christ \f + \ft metonymy \f*,
\add God is\add* pleased with you, because it shows that the Spirit of God, the Spirit who
\add reveals how\add* great \add God is\add*, lives within you. 
\v 15 If you suffer, do not let that suffering be the result of your being a murderer or a thief or as a result of doing some
other evil deed, or as a result of interfering in someone else's affairs.
\v 16 But if you suffer because of being a Christian, do not be ashamed about it. Instead, praise God that you are suffering
because of belonging to Christ \f + \ft metonymy \f*. 
\v 17 I say that, because it is now time for God to begin judging people, and first he will judge those who belong \f + \ft metonymy \f* to
him. Since he will judge us believers first, think about the terrible things that will happen to \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* those who do not obey
the good message that comes from him! 
\v 18  \add That will be as it\add* is written in the Scriptures,
\q \add Many\add* righteous people \add will have to suffer\add* many
\add difficult trials before going to heaven\add*. 
\q So ungodly and sinful people will surely have to suffer \add much severe punishment from
God\add*! 
\p
\v 19 Therefore, those who suffer because of its being God's will that they suffer
\add because of being Christians\add* should commit themselves to God, the one who created them and the one who always does
what he promises to do. And they should continue to do what is right.
