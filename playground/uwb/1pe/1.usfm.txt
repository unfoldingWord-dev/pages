\v 1 I, Peter, who \add have been appointed by\add* Jesus Christ {one whom Jesus Christ
\add has appointed\add*} to be an apostle, \add am writing this letter\add* to you believers whom God has chosen to belong to
him. \add You are living\add* in \add the Roman provinces of\add* Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia.
\add Just like the Jews who lived in Israel long ago were\add* scattered
\add to other countries far from their homes\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, you now live
\add far from\add* heaven, which is\add your true home\add*. 
\v 2 God our Father chose you according to what he himself decided previously, and his Spirit has set you apart in order that
you would obey Jesus Christ, and in order that \add just like Moses\add* sprinkled
\add the Israelites with blood when God established the old covenant\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*,
\add Jesus would establish his new covenant with you\add* with the blood
\add that flowed from his body when he died\add*. May God act very kindly to you, and may he give you much
\add inner\add* peace. 
\s 1 Peter 1:3-12 
\s God has done great things for you. Although you are now enduring trials to test your faith, you are rejoicing about your
salvation. That salvation is something that the prophets who lived long ago did not fully understand.
\p
\v 3 Praise God, who is the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! It is because of his great mercy to
\add us that he has given us new life\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. Because he has caused Jesus Christ to become alive again after he died, he
has enabled us to live very confidently; that is, to fully expect to receive the things
\add that God\f + \ft Or: he \f* has promised to give us\add*. 
\v 4 He has enabled us to expect to receive an absolutely imperishable\f + \ft Or: indestructible \f* \f + \ft triple \f* inheritance that has been {that
\add God\add* has} preserved in heaven for us. 
\v 5 God, by his mighty power, is guarding you as you trust in Jesus.
\add He is keeping you safe so\add* that he may, at the end of the time in which we now live \f + \ft Or: when Jesus returns \f*,
completely deliver you \add from Satan's power\add*. 
\v 6 You rejoice because of what will happen then, but now you are grieving for a short time while
\add God is allowing\add* you to be tested {\add various things\add*
\add to\add* test you \f + \ft metaphor \f*}, \add as precious metals are tested\add*
{\add someone tests precious metals\add*} \add to see if they are
pure\add*. \add These trials that you are experiencing are necessary\add*
\v 7 to prove that you really do trust in Jesus. His proving that will be more valuable than gold,
\add which does not last forever even\add* though it is purified
\add by being put\add* {someone tries to make it pure by \add putting
it\add*} \add in a hot\add* fire. As a result of your passing the test
\add and proving that you really do trust in Jesus\add*, God will honor you very highly \f + \ft triple \f* when Jesus Christ comes again.
\v 8 You love \add Jesus\add*, although you have not seen him. Although you do not see him now, you rejoice very much \f + \ft doublet \f*
\v 9 because you are experiencing the result of your believing in him; that is,
\add God\add* is saving you \f + \ft synecdoche \f* \add from the guilt of your sins\add*.
\p
\v 10 As for those who \add long ago\add* spoke messages that God had revealed to them about how God would act kindly toward
you in ways which you did not deserve, they investigated very carefully\f + \ft Or: tried very hard to learn \f* \f + \ft doublet \f* about how God would
save you. 
\v 11 They wanted to know whom the Spirit of Christ that was in them was referring to, and what time he was talking about, when
he told beforehand that the Messiah would suffer \add and die\add*, and that glorious\f + \ft Or: wonderful \f* things would happen
\add to him and to us\add* afterwards. 
\v 12 It was revealed to {\add God\add* told} them that it was not for their own sake that he was revealing these things to
them, but that it was for your sake. It was these things that were proclaimed to you by those who told you the message
\add about Christ {that those who told you the message about Christ proclaimed to
you\add*}. They proclaimed them to you because the Holy Spirit whom
\add God\add* sent from heaven \add enabled them to do that\add*. And even angels would like to know more about these
\add truths about how God saves us\add*. 
\s 1 Peter 1:13-25 
\s You must live holy and reverent lives and love each other, because Christ has bought you and given you a new life.
\p
\v 13 Therefore, \add prepare your minds\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add as people\add* fasten their belts around their waists
\add to prepare to work\add*. \add What I mean is that\add* you should discipline your minds\f + \ft Or: control what you think about \f*,
and by doing that conduct your lives fully and confidently expecting to receive the good things that
\add God will\add* kindly \add do for you\add* when Jesus Christ returns
\add from heaven\add*. 
\v 14  \add And because you should obey your heavenly Father\add* \f + \ft simile \f*, as children
\add ought to\add* obey their fathers \add here on earth\add*, do not do the evil deeds that you used to desire to do when you
did not know \add God's truth\add*. 
\v 15 Instead, just like God, the one who chose you \add to belong to
him\add*, is holy\f + \ft Or: separate from evil \f*, you also must be holy\f + \ft Or: separate from evil \f* in everything that you do,
\v 16 because it is {\add someone\f + \ft Or: Moses \f*\add* has} written \add in the Scriptures that God
said\add*, "You must be holy\f + \ft Or: separate from evil \f* because I am holy\f + \ft Or: separate from evil \f*."
\p
\v 17 God is the one who impartially\f + \ft Or: without favoritism \f* judges what each one does. Since you call him 'Father,' conduct
yourselves reverently\f + \ft Or: with great respect for him \f* during the time that you are living here on earth.
\add While you are living here, you are\add* like exiles\f + \ft Or: foreigners \f* \f + \ft metaphor \f*
\add because you are away from heaven, which is your true home\add*.
\v 18  \add Live reverently\add* because you know that it was not with things that will not last forever, things like gold and
silver, that \add God\add* bought you to free you from your useless life-style that you learned from your ancestors.
\v 19 Instead, \add it was\add* with the precious blood of Christ
\add that flowed from his body when he died that God bought you. Christ's death was a perfect sacrifice for
us\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add like\add* the lambs that \add the Jewish priests sacrificed
were\add* perfect, without any blemishes\f + \ft Or: defects \f*\f + \ft Or: flaws \f* or spots \f + \ft doublet \f*.
\v 20 He was chosen \add by God\add* {\add God\add* chose him} before the world was created
{\add he\add* created the world}. But it was not until now, when the time
\add in which we are living will soon\add* end, that \add God\add* revealed him for your sake.
\v 21 Because of what Christ has done, you are trusting in God, who caused him to become alive again after he died, and greatly
honored him. As a result, God is the one in whom you are trusting and confidently expecting
\add that he will do great things for you\add*. 
\p
\v 22 Because you have been made pure by obeying the truth, with the result that you sincerely love your fellow believers,
continue to love each other earnestly and sincerely\f + \ft Or: wholeheartedly \f*.
\v 23  \add I ask you to do this, because you now have\add* a new life \f + \ft metaphor \f*. It was not
\add by means of\add* something that will perish that you received this new life. Instead, it was
\add by means of\add* something that will last forever; that is, by believing the life-giving and enduring message of God.
\v 24  \add We know that this is true\add* because, \add as the prophet Isaiah
wrote\add*, 
\q All people \add will perish\add* \f + \ft simile \f*, like grass \add perishes\add*. And all the greatness\f + \ft Or: honor \f* that people have
\add will not last forever\add*, 
\q like the flowers \f + \ft simile \f* \add that grow up\add* in the grass \add do not last
long\add*. 
\q The grass withers and the flowers die, 
\q
\v 25 but God's message endures\f + \ft Or: lasts \f* forever. 
\q This message \add that endures\f + \ft Or: lasts \f*\add* is the message \add about
Christ\add* that was proclaimed to you.
