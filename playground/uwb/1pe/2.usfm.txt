\c 2  
\s 1 Peter 2:1-10 
\s Do not act maliciously or be hypocrites. God is joining you together into a holy group indwelt by his Spirit, to do deeds
that are pleasing to him. 
\p
\v 1 Therefore, do not act maliciously in any way or deceive others. Do not be a hypocrite\f + \ft Or: try to make others think that you
have qualities that you do not really have \f*, and do not envy\f + \ft Or: be jealous of \f* others. Do not ever slander anyone.
\v 2 Just like newborn babies \add long for their mothers'\add* pure milk \f + \ft metaphor \f*, you should long for
\add God's\add* spiritual \add truth\add*, so that by learning it you may become
\add spiritually\add* mature. \add You need to\add* do this until the day when God
\add will\add* free you completely \add from all the evil in this
world\add*. 
\v 3  \add Also, you need to do this\add* because you have experienced that the Lord
\add acts in\add* a good way toward you. 
\p
\v 4 You have come to the Lord Jesus. He is \add like an important\add* stone \f + \ft metaphor \f*
\add put in the foundation of a building\add*, \add but he is\add* living,
\add not lifeless like a stone\add*. He was rejected by \add many\add* people
{\add Many\add* people rejected him}, but God chose him and \add considers
him\add* to be very precious. 
\v 5  \add And like men\add* build houses with stones \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add God\add* is causing you to be joined together into a group in
which \add God's\add* Spirit \add lives\add*, in order that you, because of what Jesus Christ did for us, might, like priests
who offer sacrifices, \add do deeds\add* that are pleasing to God.
\v 6  \add What Isaiah wrote\add* in the Scriptures \add shows us that this is
true\add*. \add He wrote these words that God said\add*, 
\q Note this well: I am placing in Jerusalem \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add one who is
like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* an extremely valuable \f + \ft doublet \f* stone\f + \ft Or: cornerstone, the most important stone in the structure of a building \f*, and
those who believe in him will never be disappointed. 
\p
\v 7 Therefore, \add God will\add* honor you who believe in \add Jesus\add*. But those who
\add refuse to\add* believe in him \add are like the builders\add* that this Scripture
\add talks about\add*, 
\q The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone\f + \ft Or: the most important stone in the foundation of the
building \f*. 
\p
\v 8 And \add it is also written\add* {\add Isaiah wrote\add*} in the Scriptures:
\q \add He will be like\add* a stone that causes people to stumble,
\q and like a rock that people trip over. 
\p \add Just as people are injured when\add* they stumble over a rock,
\q people who disobey the message \add about Jesus are injured spiritually\add*,
\q and that is what \add God\add* determined would happen to them.
\p
\v 9 But you are people whom God has chosen \add to belong to him\add*. You are
\add a group that represents God like\add* priests do, and you rule with God \f + \ft metaphor \f* like kings. You are a holy group of
people\f + \ft Or: a group of people who are separate from evil \f*. You are people who belong to God. This is in order that you might
proclaim the virtues of \add God. He has\add* called you from \add your former
ways\add*, \add when you were ignorant of his truth\add*, into the marvelous
\add understanding that he gives us\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. \add That is, he has called
you\add* out of \add spiritual\add* darkness into \add spiritual\add* light.
\v 10  \add What the prophet Hosea wrote is true of you\add*, 
\q Formerly, you were not a people \add who had a relationship with
God\add*, 
\q But now you are God's people. 
\q At one time \add God\add* had not acted mercifully toward you,
\q But now he has acted mercifully toward you. 
\s 1 Peter 2:11-12 
\s Avoid obeying your self-directed natures. Conduct your lives in a good way among unbelievers.
\p
\v 11 You people whom I love, I urge you to consider that you are like foreigners \f + \ft metaphor, doublet \f*
\add whose real home is in heaven\add*. As a result, avoid doing the things that your self-directed nature desires, because
those desires fight against\f + \ft Or: always oppose \f* your souls. 
\v 12 Keep conducting your lives in a good way among those who do not know God.
\add If you do that\add*, although they may accuse you, saying that you are people who do what is evil, they will see your good
behavior, and at the time when God comes \add to judge people\add*, they will give honor to him\f + \ft Or: say that what he does is
right \f*. 
\s 1 Peter 2:13-17 
\s Submit yourselves to human authorities, and act as servants of God should.
\p
\v 13 For the sake of the Lord \add Jesus\add*, submit yourselves to every human authority. That includes submitting yourselves
to the king, who is the most important authority, 
\v 14 and to governors, who are sent by the king {whom the king sends} to punish those who do what is wrong and to
commend\f + \ft Or: honor \f* those who do what is right. 
\v 15 What God wants is that by your doing \add only\add* what is good you will cause that foolish people who do not know
\add God\add* will be unable to say things \add to condemn you\f + \ft Or: to show you why you should be
punished\add* \f*. 
\v 16 Conduct your lives as though you were free \add from having to obey
authorities\add*, but do not think 'Because I am free from having to obey authorities, I can do what is evil.' Instead, act as
servants of God \add should\add*. 
\v 17 Act respectfully toward everyone. Love all your fellow believers. Revere God, and honor the king.
\s 1 Peter 2:18-25 
\s You slaves must submit yourselves to your masters, even if they mistreat you. Imitate Christ in the way in which he suffered
unjustly. 
\p
\v 18 You slaves \add who are believers\add*, submit yourselves to your masters and completely respect them. Submit yourselves
not only to those who \add act in a\add* good and kind \f + \ft doublet \f* way towards you, but also submit yourselves to those who
\add act in a\add* harsh way \add towards you\add*. 
\v 19 You should do that because God is pleased with those who, knowing that he is aware of what is happening to them, endure
the pain that they suffer \add because of being treated unjustly by their
masters\add* {\add their masters have treated them unjustly\add*}.
\v 20 God will certainly not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* be pleased with you if you do something that is wrong and as a result you are beaten
{someone beats you}! But if, instead of doing wrong, you do what is good, and as a result of that, you suffer for doing what is
good, and you endure that suffering, God will commend\f + \ft Or: be pleased with \f* you.
\v 21 One of the reasons why God chose you is that you would \add suffer\add*. When Christ suffered for you he became an
example for you, in order that you would imitate what\f + \ft Or: do like \f* he did.
\v 22  \add Remember how Christ conducted himself\add*, 
\q He never sinned, 
\q And he never said \f + \ft metonymy \f* anything to deceive people. 
\q
\v 23 When people insulted him, he did not insult them in return.
\q When people caused him to suffer, he did not threaten to get revenge\f + \ft Or: to cause them to suffer \f*.
\q Instead, he decided to let God, who always judges justly, prove that he was innocent\f + \ft Or: had done nothing that is wrong \f* \f + \ft Or:
he left his case in the hands of God, who always judges justly \f*.
\q
\v 24 He himself endured the punishment for our sins in his body when he died on the cross,
\q in order that we would stop sinning \f + \ft Or: no longer respond to sinful desires \f* and start living righteous lives.
\p It is because he was wounded {they wounded him} that your \add souls have been
saved\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add from being sinful, as people's bodies\add* are healed
\add from being sick\add*. 
\v 25 Truly you were like sheep that had gone astray \f + \ft simile \f*, but now you have returned to
\add Jesus\add*, who cares for your souls \add as\add* a shepherd
\add cares for his sheep\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
