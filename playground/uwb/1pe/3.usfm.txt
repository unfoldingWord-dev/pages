\c 3  
\s 1 Peter 3:1-6 
\s You women should submit yourselves to your husbands, even if they are not believers, and make your inner beings\f + \ft Or: hearts \f*
beautiful with qualities that will not fade away. 
\p
\v 1 You women \add believers\add*, just like \add slaves should submit themselves to their
masters\add*, submit yourselves to your husbands. Do that in order that if any of them do not believe the message
\add about Christ\add*, they may become believers without \add it being necessary
for\add* you to say anything to them \add about their relationship to
God\add*. 
\v 2  \add They will believe in Christ\add* when they see that you respect them and that your way of life is pure.
\v 3 Do not be \add trying to make\add* yourselves beautiful by decorating the outside
\add of your bodies\add*, such as ◄by the way you comb your hair\f + \ft Or: by \f* your hair
\add style\add*► or by wearing gold jewelry and fine clothes. 
\v 4 Instead, make your ◄inner beings\f + \ft Or: hearts \f*► \add beautiful\add* with qualities\f + \ft Or: attitudes \f* that will not fade away.
Specifically, have a humble and quiet\f + \ft Or: calm \f* attitude, which is something that God considers to be very valuable.
\v 5 ◄The devout women\f + \ft Or: The \f* women who habitually worshipped God► who lived long ago and who trusted in God made themselves
beautiful \add by having attitudes\add* like that, and by being submissive to their husbands.
\v 6 Sarah, for example, obeyed \add her husband\add* Abraham and called him ‘my master’. You will be
\add as though you are\add* \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* her daughters if you do what is right and are not afraid
\add of what your husbands or anyone else may do to you because you are
believers\add*. 
\s 1 Peter 3:7 
\s You men must live in an appropriate way with your wives, so that nothing will hinder your prayers.
\p
\v 7 You men \add who are believers\add*, just like your wives should respect you, you should conduct your lives in an
appropriate way with them. Treat them respectfully, realizing that they are
\add usually\add* weaker than you are, and realizing that ◄they share with you\f + \ft Or: both \f* of you have► the gift
\add that God has kindly given to you, which is eternal\add* life. Do this so that nothing will hinder you from praying \f + \ft (OR,
hinder \add God\add* ◄\add from answering\f + \ft Or: from \f* doing what you ask
for\add*► when you pray). 
\s 1 Peter 3:8-12 
\s Agree with each other, love each other, be humble, and bless those who do evil to you instead of retaliating.
\p
\v 8 To end \add this part of my letter\add*, \add I say to\add* all of you, agree with each other
\add in what you think\add*. Be sympathetic \add toward each other\add*. Love
\add each other as\add* members of the same family \add should\add*. Act compassionately
\add toward each other\add*. Be humble. 
\v 9  \add When people do\add* evil things to you or insult you, do not ◄retaliate\f + \ft Or: repay \f* them by► doing evil things to them or
insulting them. Instead, \add ask God to\add* bless them, because that is what you have been chosen
\add by God\add* {what \add God\add* called you} to do, in order that you may receive a blessing
\add from him\add*. 
\v 10  \add Consider what the Psalmist wrote about the proper way of conducting our
lives\add*, 
\q As for those who want ◄to enjoy life\f + \ft Or: to \f* live happily► and experience good
\add things happening to them every\add* day, 
\q they must not speak \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* what is evil or speak \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* words that deceive others.
\q
\v 11 They must continually turn away from \add doing\add* evil, and must do what is good
\add instead\add*. 
\q They must deeply desire to enable \add people to act\add* peacefully toward each other;
\q they must zealously \add urge people to act in a\add* peaceful way,
\q
\v 12 because the Lord sees \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* what righteous people do \add and he appreciates\f + \ft Or: likes \f* what they
do\add*. 
\q He listens to righteous people when they pray \add and he answers
them\add*. 
\q But he is \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* opposed to those who do evil. 
\s 1 Peter 3:13-22 
\s Do good to others, even if you suffer for doing it, as Christ did.
\p
\v 13 If you ◄are eager\f + \ft Or: try \f* very hard► to do good deeds, ◄\add most
people\add* will not harm you.\f + \ft Or: who \f* will harm you?► \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* 
\v 14 But even if you suffer because of \add doing\add* what is right,
\add God\add* will bless you. \add Do as Isaiah wrote\add*: ‘Do not be afraid of people who ◄threaten you\f + \ft Or: say \f* things to cause
you to be afraid of what they might do to you►, and do not worry about \\f + \\ft doublet \\f* what they
\add might do to you\add*.’ 
\v 15 Instead, acknowledge in your ◄inner beings\f + \ft Or: hearts \f*► that Christ is the one who is in complete control
\add of your lives\add*. Always be ready to answer everyone who demands that you tell them about what you confidently expect
\add God to do for you\add*. 
\v 16 But answer them humbly and respectfully, and make sure that you ◄do\f + \ft Or: have \f* done► nothing wrong, in order that those who
speak evil about you may be ashamed when they see the good way in which you are conducting yourselves because of your
relationship with Christ. 
\v 17  \add It may be that God wants you\add* to suffer. But it is better to do good deeds,
\add even you suffer for doing them\add*, than to do evil deeds and suffer
\add for doing that\add*. 
\v 18  \add I say that\add* because Christ died once for the sake of people who have sinned. He was a righteous person who died
for unrighteous people. He died in order that ◄he might bring us to\f + \ft Or: we \f* might begin an intimate relationship with► God.
\add During the time that he had\add* an ordinary body, he was killed {people killed him}, but
\add God's\add* Spirit caused him to become alive again. 
\v 19 The Spirit also helped him as he went to proclaim \add God's victory to the
evil\add* spirits whom God had imprisoned \add in the heavens\add* (OR, to the spirits of those who
\add had died, and who\add* were in the place where the spirits of dead people are) \f*.
\v 20 Long ago, during the time that Noah was building a big boat,
\add those evil spirits\add* disobeyed God when he waited patiently \\f + \\ft personification \\f*
\add to see if people would turn from their evil behavior\add*. Only a few people were saved
{\add God\add* saved only a few people} \add in that boat\add*. Specifically,
\add God\add* brought only eight persons safely through the waters
\add of the flood\add*, \add while all the others drowned in it\add*.
\v 21 That water, \add by means of which eight people were saved when God punished the other
people\add* \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f*, represents \add the water in which we are\add* baptized
\add to show that God has\add* saved us \add from God punishing us\add*. The water in which we are baptized does not remove
dirt from our bodies. Instead, \add it shows that\add* we are requesting
\add God to assure us\add* that he has removed our guilt \add for having
sinned\add*. And because Jesus Christ became alive again after he died,
\add we know that God accepted his sacrifice for us and because of that was able to remove our
guilt\add*. 
\v 22 Christ has gone into heaven and is ruling \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* in the place of highest honor ◄next to God\f + \ft Or: at \f* God's side►, after
\add God\add* caused all the evil and powerful spirit beings \\f + \\ft doublet \\f* to be made subject to him.
