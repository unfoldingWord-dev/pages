\s Tola ruled the Israelis 
\p
\v 1 After Abimelech died, Tola the son of Puah and grandson of Dodo became the leader to rescue the Israeli people
\add from their enemies\add*. He belonged to the tribe of Issachar, but he lived in Shamir
\add city\add* in the hilly area where the descendants of Ephraim live.
\v 2 He ruled the Israeli people for 23 years. Then he died and was buried in Shamir.
\s Jair ruled the Israelis 
\p
\v 3 After Tola died, Jair, from the Gilead \add region\add*, became the Israelis' leader, and he ruled them for 22 years.
\v 4 He had thirty sons, and each of them had his own donkey to ride on. They each controlled a different town in the Gilead
\add region\add*. That region is still named 'The Towns of Jair.'
\v 5 When Jair died, he was buried in Kamon \add city\add*. 
\s The Ammon people-group oppressed the Israelis 
\p
\v 6 Again the Israelis did things that Yahweh said were wrong/evil. They worshiped
\add the idols\add* of \add their god\add* Baal and \add their goddess\add* Astarte. They also worshiped the gods of the Aram,
Sidon, Moab, and Ammon people-groups, and the gods of the Philistia people-group. They turned away from Yahweh and stopped
worshiping him. 
\v 7 So Yahweh was very angry with them, and he allowed the Philistia and Ammon people-groups to defeat [IDI] the Israelis.
\v 8 In that same year, those people started to oppress the Israelis who lived in the Gilead
\add region\add* on the east side of the Jordan \add River\add*. That was where the Amor people-group also lived. The Israelis
who lived in that region were caused to suffer for eighteen years.
\v 9 Then the people of the Ammon people-group crossed the Jordan
\add River\add* to fight against the people of the tribes of Judah, Benjamin, and Ephraim. They caused the Israelis' lives to
be very miserable. 
\v 10 So they cried out to Yahweh, saying “We have sinned against you. We have abandoned you, and we have been worshiping
\add the idols of their god\add* Baal.” 
\p
\v 11 Yahweh answered them, saying, “When the people of Egypt, and the Amor and Ammon and Philistia people-groups
\v 12 and the Sidon and Amalek and Maon people-groups acted in a cruel manner toward you, you cried out to me, and then I
rescued you. 
\v 13 But now you have abandoned me again, and you have been worshiping other gods. So I will not rescue you again.
\v 14 You have chosen those gods \add to be the ones that you worship\add*. So call to them to help you. Allow them to rescue
you when you have big troubles!” 
\p
\v 15 But the Israeli people said to Yahweh, “Truly we have sinned. Punish us in whatever way you wish to, but please rescue us
now!” 
\v 16 Then the Israelis threw away the \add idols of the\add* gods that belonged to other people-groups, and they worshiped
Yahweh again. He saw that were suffering very much, and he felt sorry [IDI] for them.
\p
\v 17 The Ammon people-group gathered to fight \add against the Israelis\add*, and they set up their tents in the Gilead
\add region\add*. The Israeli men also gathered and set up their tents at Mizpah,
\add which was a city in Gilead\add*. 
\v 18 The Israeli leaders said, “Who will lead our soldiers to attack the Ammon people-group? The one who will lead us will
become the leader of all us who live in this Gilead \add region\add*.”
