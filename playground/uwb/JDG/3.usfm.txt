\v 1-2 At that time there were still many people-groups in Canaan. Yahweh left there to test the Israeli people. But many of
the Israelis in Canaan were ones who had not fought in any of the wars in Canaan. So Yahweh also left those people-groups in
Canaan so that the descendants of those who had not fought in any of the wars might learn how to fight.
\v 3  \add This is a list of\add* the people-groups that Yahweh left there: the Philistines and their five leaders, the people
living in the area near Sidon \add city\add*, the descendants of Canaan, and the descendants of Hiv who were living in the
mountains of Lebanon between Baal-Hermon Mountain and Lebo-Hamath.
\v 4 Yahweh left these people-groups there to test the Israelis, to see if they would obey his commands which he had told Moses
to give them. 
\v 5 The Israelis lived among the Canaan people-group, the Hiv people-group, the Amor people-group, the Periz people-group, the
Hiv people-group, and the Jebus people-group. 
\v 6  \add Moses had told the people not to associate with any of those
people\add*. But the Israelis took daughters of people from those people-groups
\add to be their own wives\add*, and gave their own daughters to men of those groups, to marry them. And
\add as a result\add* they started to worship the gods of those people-groups.
\s Othniel became their first leader 
\p
\v 7 The Israelis did things that Yahweh said were very evil. They forgot about Yahweh, their God, and they started to worship
the \add idols that represented\add* the god Baal and the goddess Asherah.
\v 8 Yahweh became very angry with the Israelis. So he allowed king Cushan from Mesopotamia to conquer them and rule them for
eight years. 
\v 9 But when they pleaded to Yahweh \add to help them\add*, he brought a leader to rescue them. He was Othniel, the son of
Caleb's younger brother Kenaz. 
\v 10 Yahweh's Spirit came upon him, and he became their leader. He
\add led an army that\add* fought against \add the army of\add* Cushan, and defeated them.
\v 11 After that, there was peace in the land for forty years, until Othniel died.
\s Ehud became their next leader 
\p
\v 12 After that, the Israelis again did things that Yahweh said were very evil. As a result, he allowed the army of King
Eglon, who ruled the Moab \add area\add*, to defeat the Israelis.
\v 13 Eglon persuaded the leaders of the Ammon and Amalek people-groups to join their armies with his army to attack Israel.
They captured \add Jericho, which was called\add* 'The City of Palm Trees.'
\v 14 Then King Eglon ruled the Israelis for eighteen years. 
\p
\v 15 But then the Israelis again pleaded to Yahweh \add to help
them\add*. So he brought another leader to rescue them. He was Ehud, a left-handed man, the son of Gera, from the descendants
of Benjamin. The Israelis sent him to King Eglon to give him their yearly protection money.
\v 16 Ehud had with him a double-edged dagger, about a foot and a half long. He strapped it to his right thigh, under his
clothes. 
\v 17 He gave the money to King Eglon, who was a very fat man. 
\v 18 Then Ehud started to go back home with the men who had carried the money.
\v 19 When they arrived at the stone carvings near Gilgal, \add he told the other men to go on,
but\add* he himself turned around and went back \add to the king of Moab. When he arrived at the
palace\add*, he said to the king, “Your majesty, I have a secret message for you.” So the king told all his servant to be
quiet, and sent them out of the room. 
\p
\v 20 Then, as Eglon was sitting along in the upstairs room of his summer palace, Ehud came close to him and said, “I have a
message for you from God.” As the king got up from his chair, 
\v 21 Ehud reached with his left hand and pulled the dagger from his right thigh, and plunged it into the king's belly.
\v 22 He thrust it in so far that the handle went into the king's belly, and the blade came out the king's back. Ehud did not
pull the dagger out. \add He left it there, with\add* the handle buried in the king's fat.
\v 23 Then Ehud left the room. He went out to the porch. He shut the doors to the room and locked them.
\p
\v 24 After he had gone, his servants came back, but they saw that the doors of the room were locked. They said, “The king must
be defecating in the inner room.” 
\v 25 So they waited, but when the king did not open the doors of the room, after a while they were worried. They got a key and
unlocked the doors. And they saw that their king was lying on the floor, dead.
\p
\v 26 Meanwhile, Ehud escaped. He passed by the stone carvings and arrived at Seirah, in the hilly area where the descendants
of Ephraim lived. 
\v 27 There he blew a trumpet \add to signal that the people should join him to fight the people of
Moab\add*. So the Israelis went with him from the hills. They went down toward
\add the Jordan river\add*, with Ehud leading them. 
\p
\v 28 He said to the men, “Yahweh is going to allow us to defeat your enemies, the people of Moab. So follow me!” So they
followed him down to the river, and they stationed some of their men at the place where people can walk across the river, in
order that they could \add kill any people from Moab who tried to\add* cross the river
\add to escape\add*. 
\v 29 At that time, the Israelis killed about ten thousand people from Moab. They were all strong and capable men, but not one
of them escaped. 
\v 30 On that day, the Israelis conquered the people of Moab. Then there was peace in their land for eighty years.
\s Shamgar became their next leader 
\p
\v 31 After Ehud \add died\add*, Shamgar became their leader. He rescued the Israelis
\add from the Philistines. In one battle\add* he killed six hundred Philistines with an ◄ox goad/sharp wooden pole►.
