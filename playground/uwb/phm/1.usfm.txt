\v 1  \add I\add*, Paul, am a prisoner \add who serves\add* Christ Jesus.
\add I am here\add* with Timothy, our fellow believer. \add I am writing this
letter\add* to \add you\add*, Philemon, our dear \add friend\add* and fellow worker.
\v 2  \add I am also writing\add* to \add your wife\add*, Apphia, and to Archippus,
\add who is like\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f* our fellow soldier \add because he serves Christ steadfastly together with
us\add*. I am also \add writing this\add* to the congregation \add that
meets/gathers\add* in your\add (sg)\add* house. 
\v 3  \add I pray that\add* God our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ
\add will continue to\add* act kindly toward you all and \add will continue
to\add* cause you to have \add inner\add* peace. 
\s Philemon 4-7 
\s I thank God and rejoice greatly because you have shown that you love God's people.
\p
\v 4 I always thank my God when I pray for you\add (sg)\add*, because I hear
\add people say that\add* you love all God's people \f + \fr chiasmus \f* 
\v 5 and that you continue to trust in the Lord Jesus. 
\v 6 I pray that as a result of your knowing all the good things
\add that God/Christ has done for\add* us, you may ◄be effective/influence many others► as you tell others what you believe, in
order that \add they may honor\add* Christ. 
\v 7 I have rejoiced greatly and have been greatly encouraged because you, my dear friend, have acted lovingly toward God's
people by encouraging them \f + \fr synecdoche \f*. 
\s Philemon 8-11 
\s Because I know that you love God's people, I request, rather than command you, to do what you ought to do for my spiritual
son Onesimus. 
\p
\v 8 So \add I have a request/favor to ask of you\add*. I am completely confident
\add that I have authority\add* to command you \add to do\add* what you ought to do, because
\add I am an apostle of\add* Christ. 
\v 9 But because \add I know that you\add* love \add God's people\add*, I request this instead
of\add commanding you to do it\add*. It is I, Paul, an old man and now also a prisoner
\add because I serve\add* Christ Jesus, \add who am requesting it\add*.
\v 10 I request that you \add do something\add* for someone \add who has become
like\add* my own son \add because I told him about Christ\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f* while
\add I have been\add* a prisoner \f + \fr metonymy \f* \add here. His name is\add* Onesimus.
\v 11 Although \add his name, as you know, means ‘useful’\add*, formerly he was useless to you. But now he is useful both to
you and to me! 
\s Philemon 12-16 
\s I am sending Onesimus back to you. He is as dear to me as my own self, and he will now be even dearer to you than he is to
me. 
\p
\v 12 Although ◄he is \add as dear to me as/I love him as much as I
love\add*► \f + \fr metaphor \f* my own self \f + \fr metonymy \f*, I am sending him back to you.
\v 13 I would like to have kept him with me, in order that he might serve me on your behalf, while I am a prisoner \f + \fr metonymy \f*
\add because of my preaching\add* the message \add about Christ\add*.
\v 14 Nevertheless, because \add I had not yet asked you and\add* you had not yet permitted me
\add to keep him here with me\add*, I decided not to \add keep him here. I decided that I
should\add* not do anything without your permitting it. \add I decided that you should help me only if
you\add* really want to help me. 
\v 15 Perhaps the reason that \add God permitted\add* Onesimus to be separated from {to leave} you for a little while was that
\add he would believe in Christ, and as a result\add* you would have him ◄back/with you► forever!
\v 16  \add You will no longer have him only\add* as a slave. Instead,
\add you will have him\add* as \add someone who is\add* more than a slave.
\add You will have him\add* as a fellow believer! He is especially dear to me, but he certainly will be more dear to you
\add than he is to me\add* \f + \fr (OR, I love him very much, but you will certainly love him more than I do),
\add because now he\add* not only belongs to you but he also belongs to the Lord.
\s Philemon 17-19 
\s If you consider me to be your partner, receive Onesimus as you would receive me. I guarantee to repay you whatever Onesimus
owes you. 
\p
\v 17 So, if you consider me to be your partner \add in God's work\add*, receive him as you would receive me.
\v 18 If he has wronged you in any manner or if he owes you anything, ◄charge that to me/tell me so that I can pay you►.
\v 19 I, Paul, am now writing this in my own handwriting: I will repay you what he owes you, although I might mention to you
that you owe me even more than Onesimus may owe you, because it was the result of my telling you about Christ that God saved
your soul/you. 
\s Philemon 20 
\s Please encourage me in this matter as you encourage other believers in Christ.
\p
\v 20 ◄Yes/I say it again►, my dear friend, because you and I both have a relationship with the Lord, I want you to do this for
me. Encourage me \f + \fr synecdoche \f* \add by receiving Onesimus kindly, just like you encourage others who
believe\add* in Christ. 
\s Philemon 21 
\s I have written this letter to you confident of your compliance with my request.
\p
\v 21 I have written \add this letter\add* to you, confident that you will do what I am requesting you to
\add do\add*. \add In fact\add*, I know that you will do even more than what I am requesting
\add you to do\add*. 
\s Philemon 22 
\s Also, keep a guest room ready for me. 
\p
\v 22 Also, keep a guest room ready for me \add to stay in\add*, because I confidently expect that as a result of your prayers
\add for me, I\add* will be released \add from prison and will come\add* to you all.
\s Philemon 23-25 
\s My other fellow workers greet you(sg). May the Lord Jesus Christ bless you(pl) \f* spiritually.
\p
\v 23 Epaphras, who is \add suffering\add* with me in prison because of
\add his serving\add* Christ Jesus, ◄sends his greetings to you/wants you to know that he is thinking fondly about you►.
\v 24 Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, who are my \add other\add* fellow workers, also ◄send their greetings to you/want you
to know that they are thinking fondly about you►. 
\v 25  \add I pray that\add* the Lord Jesus Christ \add will\add*
◄\add continue to\add* work kindly in all your lives/kindly keep accomplishing what he desires within you►.
