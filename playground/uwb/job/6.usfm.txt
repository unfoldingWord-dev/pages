\c 6  
\s Job refuted Eliphaz' claim 
\p
\v 1 Then Job spoke again, saying \add to Eliphaz\add*, 
\q
\v 2 "If all my troubles and misery could be put on a scale and weighed,
\q
\v 3 they would be heavier than all the sands \add on the shores\add* of the oceans.
\q2 That is why I spoke very rashly\f + \ft Or: without thinking clearly \f* \add about the day that I was
born\add*. 
\q
\v 4  \add It is as though\add* Almighty \add God\add* has shot me with arrows.
\q2 \add It is as though\add* those arrows had poison on their tips, and that poison has gone into my spirit.
\q The things that God \add has done to me\add* have terrified me.
\q
\v 5 Just like a wild donkey does not \add complain by\add* braying when it has plenty of grass to eat,
\q2 and an ox does not \add complain by\add* bellowing when it has food to eat \f + \ft metaphor \f*,
\q \add I would not complain if you were really helping\f + \ft Or: comforting \f*
me\add*. 
\q
\v 6 People complain \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* when they must eat food which has no salt
\q2 or other slimy tasteless food \f + \ft metaphor \f*, 
\q \add and that is what your words are like, Eliphaz\add*. 
\q
\v 7 Just like I have I do not want to eat food \add like that\add*,
\q2 and my palate loathes\f + \ft Or: detests \f* that kind of food \f + \ft metaphor \f*, 
\q \add I do not appreciate what you have said to me\add*. 
\b
\q
\v 8 I wish that God would do for me what I have requested from him \f + \ft doublet \f*.
\q
\v 9 I wish that he would crush me \add and let me die\add*. 
\q2 I wish that he would reach out his hand and take away my life.
\q
\v 10 If he would do that, I would be comforted by knowing that in spite of the great pain that I have suffered,
\q2 I have always obeyed what \add God\add*, the Holy One, has commanded.
\b
\q
\v 11 But now I do not have \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* enough strength to endure all these things.
\q2 And since I have nothing \add to hope for\add* in the future\f + \ft Or: this life \f*,
\q2 it is difficult for me to be patient now \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*. 
\q
\v 12 I am not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* strong like rocks are, 
\q2 and my body is not made of bronze. 
\q
\v 13 So I am not able to help myself, 
\q2 and \add it seems that\add* there is no one to rescue me. 
\b
\s Job's friends were not helping him 
\q
\v 14 When a man has many troubles, his friends should be kind to him,
\q2 even if he stops revering Almighty \add God\add*. 
\q
\v 15 But \add you\add*, my friends, are not dependable. 
\q2 You are like streams: they spill over their banks \add in the
spring\add* 
\q
\v 16 when \add the melting\add* ice and snow make those streams overflow,
\q
\v 17 but when the dry season comes, there is no water flowing \add in those
streams\add*, 
\q2 and the channels dry up. 
\q
\v 18  \add The caravans of merchants\add* turn off the path \add to search for some
water\add*, 
\q2 but there is no water, 
\q2 so they die \add in the desert\add*. 
\q
\v 19 The men in those caravans searched \add for some water\add*
\q2 because they were sure that they would find some. 
\q
\v 20 But they did not find any, 
\q2 so they were very disappointed. 
\q
\v 21 Similarly, you friends have not helped me at all! 
\q You have seen that terrible things have happened to me, 
\q2 and you are afraid \add that God might do similar things to you\add*.
\q
\v 22  \add After I lost all my wealth\add*, did I ask any of you for money?\f + \ft Or: I did not ask any of you for money. \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\q2 Did I plead with any of you to spend some of your money to help me \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*?
\q
\v 23 Have I asked any of you to rescue me from my enemies \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*?
\q2 Have I asked you to save me from those who oppressed me\f + \ft Or: treated me badly \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*?
\add No\add*! 
\s Job insisted he had done no wrong 
\q
\v 24 Answer me now, and then I will be quiet; 
\q2 tell me what wrong things I have done! 
\q
\v 25 When people speak what is true, that will not hurt the person who hears it,
\q2 but what you say, criticizing me, \add is not true, so your saying
it\add* proves nothing \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*! 
\q
\v 26 I am a man who has nothing to hope for, 
\q2 but you try to correct me, and you think what I say is nothing but wind \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*!
\q
\v 27 You do not sympathize with me at all \add for all that I am
suffering\add*. 
\q2 \add You will do anything to get things for yourselves\add*! You would even play a game to see who gets an orphan
\add as a prize\add*! 
\b
\q
\v 28 Please look at me! I will not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* lie while I am looking at your faces.
\q
\v 29 Stop \add saying that I have sinned\add*, and stop criticizing me unjustly!
\q2 You should realize that I have not done things that are wrong.
\q
\v 30 Do you think that I am lying? 
\q2 No, I am not lying, because I know what is right and what is wrong \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*."
