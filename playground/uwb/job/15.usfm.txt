\c 15  
\s Eliphaz rebuked Job again 
\p
\v 1 Then Eliphaz replied to Job: 
\q
\v 2 “If you were truly wise \f + \fk rhetorical question \f*, you would not have replied to us by claiming that you know a lot;
\q2 what you are saying is just a lot of hot air \f + \fk metaphor \f*. 
\q
\v 3 You should not \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* be saying things that do not benefit anyone,
\q2 using words that do no one any good. 
\q
\v 4 You are showing that you do not have a reverential respect for God,
\q2 and you are hindering people from meditating/thinking about God.
\q
\v 5 What you say \f + \fk metonymy \f* shows that you are very wicked; 
\q2 you talk like deceptive/crafty people talk. 
\q
\v 6 Everything that you say \f + \fk metonymy \f* shows that you should be punished;
\q2 so, it is not necessary for me to show that. 
\b
\q
\v 7  \add Tell me\add*, do you \add know more than everyone else
because\add* you are the first person who was ever born? [SAR, RHQ]
\q2 Were you born before the hills \add were created\add*? 
\q
\v 8 Were you listening when God made all his plans? [SAR, RHQ] 
\q2 Or do you think that you are the only person who is wise? 
\q
\v 9 ◄What do you know that we do not know?/You do not know anything that we do not know.► \f + \fk rhetorical question \f*
\q2 You do not understand \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* anything that is not also clear to us.
\q
\v 10 My friends and I are also wise; 
\q2 \add we acquired wisdom\add* from old gray-haired people, 
\q2 from people who were born before your father was. 
\q
\v 11 God wants to comfort you, 
\q and to speak gently/kindly to you; 
\q2 ◄is that not enough for you/do you need more than that►? 
\q
\v 12 Why do you allow yourself to be excited by your emotions? 
\q2 Why are \add you very angry, with the result that\add* your eyes flash?
\q
\v 13 You are angry [IDI] with God, 
\q2 and so you \f + \fk metonymy \f* are criticizing/denouncing him. 
\b
\q
\v 14 ◄How can any person, \add including you\add*, be sinless?/No person,
\add including you\add*, can be sinless.► \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* 
\q2 ◄How can anyone on the earth be \add completely\add* righteous?/No one on the earth can be
\add completely\add* righteous.► \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* 
\q
\v 15 Hey, God does not even trust his angels; 
\q2 he does not consider even them to be \add completely\add* pure.
\q
\v 16 So, he certainly does not \add trust\add* abominable/disgusting and depraved/corrupt people
\q2 who commit evil deeds \add as easily as\add* they drink water \f + \fk metaphor \f*.
\b
\q
\v 17 Job, listen to what I will tell you. 
\q2 I will declare to you what I know, 
\q
\v 18 things that wise men have told me, 
\q2 truths that their ancestors did not keep hidden. 
\q
\v 19 God gave this land to those ancestors, who were truly wise;
\q2 no one from another country caused them to think wrongly [IDI].
\q
\v 20 It is wicked people who suffer with great pain all the time that they are alive;
\q2 that is what happens to those who ◄oppress/act violently toward► others.
\q
\v 21 They constantly hear sounds that terrify them; 
\q2 while they are prospering, bandits attack them. 
\q
\v 22 Wicked people surely know that they will not escape from darkness/death,
\q2 because \add they are sure that\add* someone is waiting to kill them with a sword.
\q
\v 23 They wander around, searching for food, saying ‘Where can I find some?’
\q2 And they know that they will soon experience disasters. 
\q
\v 24 Because they are afraid of those things happening to them, they are afraid and worry
\q2 that these things will attack them like \add the army of\add* a king waits to attack
\add their enemies and cause them to suffer\add* \f + \fk simile \f*. 
\q
\v 25  \add These things happen to them\add* because they ◄shook their fists/dared to fight► against Almighty God
\q2 and thought that they were strong enough to defeat him. 
\q
\v 26 They stubbornly [IDI] rush to attack God 
\q2 \add thinking that they were carrying\add* a strong shield \add to protect
themselves\add*. 
\q
\v 27 They are so fat \add that they are unable to fight\add*. 
\q
\v 28 They have lived in cities that have been abandoned, 
\q2 cities which \add God\add* declared would become a heap of ruins.
\q
\v 29 But they will not remain rich very long; 
\q2 everything that they own will be taken from them, 
\q2 and even their shadow will disappear \add from the earth\add*.
\q
\v 30 They will not escape from the darkness \add of death\add*;
\q2 they will be like trees whose branches are burned by fire 
\q2 and whose blossoms are blown away by the wind. 
\q
\v 31 If they are very foolish, with the result that they trust in things that are really worthless,
\q2 then things that are worthless will be all that they get. 
\q
\v 32 While they are still young, they will disappear; 
\q2 they will be like \f + \fk metaphor \f* branches that wither and never become green again.
\q
\v 33 They will be like \f + \fk simile \f* vines whose grapes fall off before they are ripe,
\q2 like olive trees whose blossoms fall off before they produce any fruit.
\q
\v 34 Groups of wicked/godless people will not have any descendants,
\q2 and fires will completely burn up the homes \add of those who built those homes
using\add* money they received from bribes. 
\q
\v 35 They plan to cause trouble and to do evil things, 
\q2 and in their inner beings they are always preparing to deceive people.”
