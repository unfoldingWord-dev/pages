\c 31  
\s Job stated his innocence 
\q
\v 1 “I made to myself a solemn promise 
\q2 that I would not look at a young woman with a desire \add to have sex with
her\add*. 
\q
\v 2  \add If I did not do what I promised\add*, 
\q2 what would God who is in heaven \f + \fk metonymy \f* do to me \f + \fk rhetorical question \f*? 
\q2 Almighty \add God\add* would certainly not \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* give me any reward!
\q
\v 3  \add Previously I thought that\add* surely \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* it was unrighteous people who would experience calamities,
\q2 and that it was those who do what is wrong who would experience disasters.
\q
\v 4 God certainly sees \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* everything that I do, 
\q2 \add so why is he causing me to suffer\add*? 
\q2 \add It is as though\add* he counts every step that I take. 
\b
\q
\v 5  \add I solemnly declare that\add* I have never acted wickedly
\q2 and have never tried to deceive people. 
\q
\v 6 I request only that God judge me fairly \f + \fk metaphor \f*, 
\q2 and if he does that, he will know that I ◄am innocent/have not done what is wrong►.
\q
\v 7 If \add it were true that\add* I have turned away from \add walking
on\add* the right paths, 
\q2 or that I \f + \fk synecdoche \f* have desired the things that I look at \f + \fk metonymy \f*,
\q2 or that my hands have been stained \add because of my committing
sins\add*, 
\q
\v 8 then I hope/wish that when I plant seeds, someone else will
\add harvest the crops and\add* eat them 
\q2 and that others will uproot the \add fruit trees\add* that I planted.
\b
\q
\v 9 If \add it were true that\add* I \f + \fk synecdoche \f* have been attracted by some other man's wife,
\q2 or that I have hidden myself and waited outside the door to her
\add house\add*, 
\q
\v 10 I hope/desire that my wife will become the servant/slave of another man
\q2 and have sex \f + \fk euphemism \f* with him. 
\q
\v 11  \add For me to do\add* that would be a terrible sin, 
\q2 and the judges would decide that I should be punished. 
\q
\v 12 My \add committing adultery\add* would \add produce in me a fire
like\add* \f + \fk metaphor \f* the fire that burns people in hell, 
\q2 and it would burn up everything that I own. 
\b
\q
\v 13 And, if \add it were true that\add* I have ever refused to listen to one of my male or female servants
\q2 when they complained to me about something, 
\q
\v 14 God would arise \add and declare that he would punish me\add*;
\q2 and when he would do that, what would I do? 
\q2 If he would ask me \add about what I have done\add*, ◄what would I answer?/I would not be able to answer.► \f + \fk rhetorical question \f*
\q
\v 15 God, who created me, certainly also created my servants \f + \fk rhetorical question \f*;
\q2 surely he is the one who formed them and me in our mothers' wombs \f + \fk rhetorical question \f*;
\q2 \add so we all should behave toward each other equally\add*.
\b
\q
\v 16-18 I have guided orphans from the time that they were born;
\q2 I have taken care of them since they were young. 
\q So, if \add it were true that\add* I ate all my food myself and did not share some of it with orphans,
\q2 or that I refused to give poor people the things that they wanted,
\q2 or that I caused widows to live ◄in despair/without hope \add that they would receive any help from
anyone\add*►, 
\q
\v 19 or that I had seen people die \add from cold\add* because they had no clothes,
\q2 or that I had seen poor people who did not have clothes \add to keep them
warm\add*, 
\q
\v 20 and they were not able to become warm \add from clothes made
from\add* the wool of my sheep 
\q2 with the result that they thanked me for it, 
\q
\v 21 or if \add it were true that\add* I threatened to strike any orphan
\q2 because I knew that the elders at the city gates would ◄enable me to win/be on my side►;
\q
\v 22  \add if those things were true about me\add*, I hope/desire that my shoulder blade would be torn out
\q2 and my arm be torn from my shoulder. 
\q
\v 23 I always feared that God would cause me to experience a great disaster
\add if I did any of those evil things\add*, 
\q2 and I would not have been able to endure the powerful \add things that he would do to punish
me\add*. 
\b
\q
\v 24 If \add it were true that\add* I trusted in my gold/money \f + \fk doublet \f*,
\q
\v 25 or that I rejoiced because I had acquired many things 
\q2 and had become very rich, 
\q
\v 26 or that I looked at the sun when it was shining 
\q2 or looked at the beautiful moon 
\q
\v 27 and I \f + \fk synecdoche \f* had been tempted \add to worship them\add* 
\q2 by kissing my hand to revere them, 
\q
\v 28 those things also would be sins for which the judges would say that I must be punished,
\q2 because I would have been rejecting God \add by doing those things\add*.
\b
\q
\v 29-30  \add It is not true that\add* I \f + \fk synecdoche \f* sinned by requesting God to curse people who hated me
\q2 and to cause them to die; 
\q or that I was glad when they were ruined 
\q2 and rejoiced when they experienced disasters \f + \fk doublet \f*; 
\q
\v 31-32  \add or that\add* I never welcomed travelers to stay in my tent
\q2 and did not open my doors to them, but \add forced them to\add* sleep in the streets.
\q2 All the men who work for me certainly know that \f + \fk rhetorical question \f*! 
\q
\v 33 Some people try to hide their sins, 
\q2 but I have never done that; 
\q
\v 34 and I never remained silent and refused to go outside 
\q2 because I was very ◄afraid of/worried about► what people would say
\add about me\add*, 
\q2 and that they would hate/scorn me. 
\b
\q
\v 35 I wish/desire that there was someone who would hear what I am saying!
\q2 I solemnly declare \add that all that I have said is true\add*.
\q I wish that those who oppose me would write down \add on a scroll\add* the evil things that they say that I did.
\q
\v 36  \add If they did that\add*, I would wear that scroll on my shoulder, or wear it on top of my head,
\add in order that everyone could see it\add*. 
\q
\v 37 I would tell \add God\add* everything that I have done, 
\q2 and I would approach him like a ruler would, \add without being
afraid\add*. 
\b
\q
\v 38 If \add it were true that\add* I have stolen land, 
\q2 with the result that \add it was as though\add* its furrows cried out to accuse me;
\q
\v 39 or that I have eaten the crops that grew in someone else's fields
\q2 without paying \add for those crops\add*, 
\q2 with the result that those farmers who grew those crops died
\add from hunger\add*; 
\q
\v 40 then I wish/desire that thorns would grow \add in my fields\add* instead of wheat,
\q2 and that bad weeds would grow instead of barley!” 
\b
\q That is the end of what Job said \add to his three friends\add*.
