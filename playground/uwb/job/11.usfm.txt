\s Zophar's first speech to Job 
\p
\v 1 Then Zophar, from the Naamah \add area\add*, said this to Job:
\q
\v 2 “◄Should no one answer all that you have said?\f + \ft Or: Someone \f* should certainly answer all that you have said.► \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f*
\q2 Just because you talk a lot, ◄should that cause us to declare that you ‘are innocent\f + \ft Or: have \f* done nothing wrong’?\f + \ft Or: that \f* should
not cause us to declare that you ‘are innocent\f + \ft Or: have \f* done nothing wrong’.► \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f*
\q
\v 3 Job, ◄should your babbling cause us to be silent?\f + \ft Or: your \f* babbling should certainly not cause us to be silent.► \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f*
\q2 When you make fun of us, shall no one \add rebuke you and\add* cause you to be ashamed?
\q
\v 4 You say, ‘What I say is true; 
\q2 God knows that I am ◄innocent\f + \ft Or: without \f* guilt►.’ 
\q
\v 5 But I wish\f + \ft Or: desire \f* that God would talk 
\q2 and say something \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* to answer you! 
\q
\v 6 God knows everything about everything, 
\q2 so I wish\f + \ft Or: desire \f* that he would tell you the secrets that he knows because he is wise.
\q But you need to know that God is punishing you less than you deserve!
\b
\q
\v 7  \add Tell me\add*, will you ever be able to find out the things about God that are very difficult to understand?
\q2 Will you be able to find out everything that there is to know about Almighty God?
\q
\v 8  \add What there is to know about God\add* is greater than \add the distance from earth
to\add* heaven; 
\q2 so there is no way \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* that you can \add understand it all\add*.
\q It is greater than \add the distance from here to\add* the place of the dead;
\q2 so it is impossible for you \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* to know it all. 
\q
\v 9 What there is to know about God is wider than the earth 
\q2 and wider than the ocean. 
\b
\q
\v 10 If God comes to you and puts you in prison and then brings you to a trial\f + \ft Or: judge \f*,
\q2 ◄who can stop him?\f + \ft Or: no \f* one can stop him.► \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* 
\q
\v 11 He knows which people are worthless; 
\q2 and when he sees people doing wicked things, ◄will he ignore it?\f + \ft Or: he \f* will certainly not ignore it!► \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f*
\q
\v 12 Stupid people \add like you\add* will start to become wise \\f + \\ft sarcasm \\f*
\q2 when wild donkeys \add stop giving birth to wild donkeys and\add* start giving birth to tame donkeys.
\b
\q
\v 13 Job, repent [IDI]; 
\q2 reach out your hands toward God. 
\q
\v 14 If you have done evil things, stop doing them; 
\q2 and do not allow any people in your house to do wicked deeds.
\q
\v 15 If you do what I have said, surely you will lift up your head because you will not be ashamed;
\q2 you will be strong, and not afraid \add of anything\add*. 
\q
\v 16 You will forget all your troubles; 
\q2 they will be like the water \add of a flood\add* that has all disappeared.
\q
\v 17  \add Your troubles will be ended, like the darkness ends\add* at the dawn;
\q2 \add it will be as though\add* \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* the sun is shining brightly on you, like
\add it shines\add* at noon. 
\q
\v 18 You will feel safe\f + \ft Or: secure \f*, because you will confidently expect
\add that good things will happen to you\add*; 
\q2 God will protect you and enable you to rest safely \add each
night\add*. 
\q
\v 19 You will lie down, and no one will cause you to be afraid.
\q2 And many people will come and request you to do things for them.
\q
\v 20 But wicked people \\f + \\ft synecdoche \\f* will not be able to understand \add why bad things are happening to
them\add*; 
\q2 they will not have any way to escape \add from their troubles\add*.
\q2 The only thing that they will want to do is to die. \\f + \\ft euphemism \\f*”
