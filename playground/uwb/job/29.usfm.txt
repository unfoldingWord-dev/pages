\s Job's final speech 
\p
\v 1 Job spoke again and said this: 
\q
\v 2 "I wish\f + \ft Or: desire \f* that I could be like I was previously, 
\q2 during the years when God took care of me. 
\q
\v 3 During those years, \add it was as though\add* God's lamp \f + \ft metaphor \f* shone on me
\q2 and gave me light while I walked in the darkness. 
\q
\v 4 At that time I was young and strong, 
\q2 and because God was my friend, \add he protected\add* \f + \ft personification \f* my tent.
\q
\v 5 Almighty \add God\add* was with me during those years 
\q2 when all my children were around me. 
\q
\v 6 My herds provided me with plenty of milk, 
\q2 and streams of oil \add flowed from\add* the rock where my olives were pressed.
\b
\q
\v 7 Whenever I went to \add the place where the elders gathered\add* at the city gate,
\q2 I sat down with them, 
\q
\v 8 and when the young men saw me, they stepped aside \add respectfully\add*,
\q2 and the old men also stood \add respectfully\add*. 
\q
\v 9 The leaders of the people stopped talking \f + \ft doublet \f*, 
\q
\v 10 and even the most important men became quiet 
\q2 and ceased talking \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add in order to hear me speak to them\add*.
\q
\v 11 When they \f + \ft synecdoche \f* all heard \add what I told them\add*, 
\q2 they said good things about me. 
\q When they \f + \ft synecdoche \f* saw me \f + \ft Or: what I had done \f*, they commended me,
\q
\v 12 because I had helped the poor people when they cried out for help
\q2 and I aided\f + \ft Or: helped \f* orphans who had no one else to help them.
\q
\v 13 Those who were suffering and about to die praised \f + \ft personification \f* me,
\q2 and I caused widows \f + \ft synecdoche \f* to sing joyfully, \add because of my helping
them\add*. 
\q
\v 14 I always acted justly; 
\q2 my continually doing that was like \f + \ft metaphor \f* a robe that I wore and a turban
\add that was wrapped around my head\add*. 
\q
\v 15  \add It was as though\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* I was eyes for blind people
\q2 and feet for people who were lame. 
\q
\v 16 I was like \f + \ft metaphor \f* a father to the poor people, 
\q2 and in the courts I defended those who were strangers. 
\q
\v 17 My causing wicked people \add to be unable to continue oppressing others was
like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* breaking the fangs \add of fierce wild animals\add*
\q2 and forcing them to drop from their teeth\f + \ft Or: mouths \f* the animals that they had caught\f + \ft Or: seized \f*.
\b
\q
\v 18 At that time I thought, 'Surely I will live securely, until I am very old \f + \ft simile \f*,
\q2 and I will die at home \add with my family\add*.' 
\q
\v 19 I was like \f + \ft metaphor \f* a tree whose roots reach down into the water
\q2 and whose branches become wet with dew each night. 
\q
\v 20 People always honored me, 
\q2 and I was always \add strong like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* a new bow. 
\b
\q
\v 21 When I spoke, people waited to hear \add what I would say\add*
\q2 and remained silent until I advised them \add what they should
do\add*. 
\q
\v 22 After I finished speaking, they did not say anymore; 
\q2 \add it was as though\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* my words fell on their ears like drops of rain.
\q
\v 23 They waited for me \add to speak\add* like they wait for rain;
\q2 they \add appreciated what I said\add* like \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add farmers
appreciate\add* the final rain in the spring \add before the dry
season\add*. 
\q
\v 24 When they were discouraged, I smiled at them \add to encourage
them\add*; 
\q2 they became encouraged when they saw my cheerful face. 
\q
\v 25 I was their leader, and I decided what things \add would be good for them to
do\add*; 
\q2 I was among them like \f + \ft simile \f* a king who is among his troops; 
\q2 I was like someone who comforts others who are mourning."
