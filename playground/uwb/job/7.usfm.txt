\c 7  
\s Job complains to God 
\q
\v 1 "People need to work hard on this earth, like soldiers do; 
\q all during the time that we are alive, we work hard \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*, like laborers\f + \ft Or: servants \f* do.
\q
\v 2 We are like \f + \ft simile \f* slaves who keep wanting to be in the cool shade,
\q2 and we are like \f + \ft simile \f* workers who are waiting to be paid. 
\q
\v 3 God has given me many months \add in which I think\add* that it is useless
\add to remain alive\add*; 
\q he has allotted\f + \ft Or: given \f* to me many nights during which I feel miserable.
\q
\v 4 When I lie down \add at night\add* I say, 'How long will it be until I get up?'
\q2 But the nights are long, and I toss\f + \ft Or: turn over and over \f* \add on my
bed\add* until the dawn. 
\q
\v 5 My body is covered with maggots and scabs; 
\q2 pus oozes out of my open sores. 
\b
\q
\v 6 My days pass as quickly as a weaver's shuttle\f + \ft Or: stick that takes the thread back and forth \f*,
\q2 and they end without my confidently expecting \add that things will be better the next
day\add*. 
\q
\v 7 God, do not forget that my life is \add as empty as\add* a breath \f + \ft metaphor \f*;
\q2 I \add think that\add* I \f + \ft synecdoche \f* will never again experience being happy.
\q
\v 8 God, you \f + \ft synecdoche \f* see me now, 
\q2 but \add some day\add* you will not see me anymore. 
\q2 You will search for me, but I will be gone \add because I will be
dead\add*. 
\q
\v 9 Like \f + \ft simile \f* clouds disperse\f + \ft Or: break up \f* and then disappear, 
\q2 people \add die and\add* descend to the place where dead people are, and they do not return;
\q
\v 10 they never return to their houses, 
\q2 and people among whom they lived do not remember them anymore.
\b
\q
\v 11 So, I will not be silent; 
\q2 while I am suffering I will speak; 
\q I will complain \add to God about what has happened to me\add*
\q2 because I \f + \ft synecdoche \f* am very angry. 
\q
\v 12  \add God\add*, why do you watch closely what I am doing? 
\q2 \add Do you think that\add* I am a \add dangerous\add* sea monster?
\q
\v 13 When I \add lie down at night\add*, I say \add to myself\add*, 'I will be comforted here on my bed;
\q2 my pain will be less while I am sleeping.' 
\q
\v 14 But then you give me dreams that cause me to be afraid; 
\q2 you give me visions that terrify me, 
\q
\v 15 with the result that I would prefer to die because of being strangled
\q2 than to continue to \add be alive\add* being only a bunch of bones.
\q
\v 16 I detest continuing to be alive; I do not want to live for many years \f + \ft hyperbole \f*.
\q2 Allow me to be alone, \add because I will be alive\add* for only a very short time \f + \ft hyperbole \f*.
\b
\q
\v 17 We human beings are not \add very important\add*; 
\q2 so, why do you pay a lot of attention to us \f + \ft doublet \f*? 
\q
\v 18 You look at us every morning \add to see what we are doing\add*,
\q2 and examine us every moment \add to see if we are doing what is
right\add*. 
\q
\v 19 When will you stop looking at me and leave me alone \add for a little
time\add*, long enough to swallow my spit?\f + \ft Or: Please stop looking at me and leave me alone
\add for a little time\add*, long enough to swallow my spit. \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\q
\v 20  \add Why do\add* you watch me constantly? 
\q2 If I sin, that certainly does not harm you! 
\q Why have you set me up like a target to shoot at? 
\q2 Do you consider me to be a heavy load that you are forced to carry?
\q
\v 21  \add If I have sinned\add*, are you not able to forgive me for my sins
\q2 and the things that I have done that are wrong? 
\q Soon I will lie in my grave; 
\q2 you will search for me, but \add you will not find me because\add* I will be
\add dead and\add* gone."
