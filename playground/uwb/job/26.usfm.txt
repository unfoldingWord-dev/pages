\s Job replied to Bildad again 
\p
\v 1 Job replied \add to Bildad\add*, saying this \add sarcastically:\add*
\q
\v 2 “I am a very weak and helpless man; 
\q2 and ◄\add you certainly have\add* helped me [SAR] very much./\add do you think that you
have\add* helped me [SAR] very much?► [RHQ] 
\q
\v 3 ◄You certainly have counseled me well—me, who am not wise at
all./\add Do you think that\add* you have counseled me well—me, who am not wise at all?► [RHQ]
\q ◄You surely have given a lot of very good advice to me./\add Do you think
that\add* you have given a lot of very good advice to me?► [RHQ]
\q
\v 4 Who helped you to say all those \add great/wise\add* things?
\q2 Who inspired you to speak like you did?” 
\s Bildad replied 
\q
\v 5 “Because the spirits of dead people \add are afraid\add*, 
\q2 they tremble in the waters that are deep under the earth. 
\q
\v 6 God knows all about \add those who are in\add* the place of the dead;
\q2 there is nothing down there that prevents God from seeing what is there.
\q
\v 7 God stretched out the earth over the huge empty space 
\q2 and caused the earth to have nothing \add to support it\add*.
\q
\v 8 He fills the thick/dense clouds with water 
\q2 and prevents that water from bursting the clouds. 
\q
\v 9 He causes clouds to ◄obscure/prevent us from seeing► the moon.
\q
\v 10 He separated the light from the darkness 
\q2 and put the horizon to mark the place where the night ends and the daytime begins.
\q
\v 11 When he \add is angry, it is as though\add* he rebukes the pillars that hold up the sky.
\q2 They are ◄shocked/very fearful►, and they tremble. 
\q
\v 12 By his power he calmed the sea; 
\q2 by his skill/wisdom he destroyed Rahab, the huge sea monster.
\q
\v 13 By his breath he caused the sky to be bright/clear; 
\q2 by his hand he killed the great dragon in the sea. 
\q
\v 14 But those events show only a small amount of his power; 
\q2 \add it is as though\add* we are hearing only whispers of his powerful voice.
\q2 When we hear thunder, \add we say\add*, ‘◄Who can really understand
\add how great\add* his power is?/No one can really understand \add how
great\add* his power is!► [RHQ]’ ”
