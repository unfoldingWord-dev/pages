\s Elihu continued his challenge 
\p
\v 1 Then Elihu also said this: 
\q
\v 2 “\add Job\add*, do you think that what you said is right\f + \ft Or: correct \f*?
\q You say, ‘God knows that I am innocent,’ 
\q
\v 3 and you say to God, ‘What good have I received for not sinning?
\q2 What benefit have I received from that?’ [DOU, RHQ] 
\q
\v 4 Well, I will answer you, 
\q2 and I will answer your three friends, too. 
\b
\q
\v 5  \add Job\add*, look up at the sky; 
\q2 look at the clouds that are high above you 
\q2 and realize \add that God is far above everything\add*. 
\q
\v 6 If you have sinned, that does not \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* harm God at all. 
\q2 If many times you do things that are wrong, that certainly does not \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* affect him \\f + \\ft doublet \\f*.
\q
\v 7 And if you are righteous, does that help God? 
\q2 No, he is not benefited by anything that you do \\f + \\ft doublet \\f*. 
\q
\v 8 It is other people who suffer because of the wicked things that you do,
\q2 but by doing good deeds for people, you help them. 
\b
\q
\v 9 People cry out because of the many things that people do to ◄oppress them\f + \ft Or: treat \f* them cruelly►;
\q2 they call for help because of the things that powerful people do \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* to them.
\q
\v 10 But ◄no one\f + \ft Or: none \f* of them► calls out \add to God\add*, 
\q2 saying ‘Why does God, my creator, \add not help me\add*? 
\q2 He should enable me to sing \add joyful\add* songs, \add instead of very sad
songs\add*, during the night. 
\q
\v 11 He \add should be able to\add* teach us more than all the wild animals do;
\q2 he should enable us to become wiser than all the birds are!’
\q
\v 12 People cry out \add for help\add*, 
\q2 but God does not answer them, 
\q2 because those who cry out are proud and evil people. 
\q
\v 13 It is useless for them to cry out, 
\q2 because God, the Almighty One, does not pay any attention to what they say.
\q
\v 14 So, when you complain that you cannot see God, 
\q2 and you tell him that you are waiting for him \add to decide whether or not you should be punished for what you have
done\add*, 
\q2 God will not listen to you, either! 
\q
\v 15 Furthermore, \add you say that\add* because he does not pay attention when people commit sins,
\q2 he does not become angry and punish them. 
\q
\v 16 You say things that are useless; 
\q2 you say a lot of things without knowing \add what you are talking
about\add*.”
