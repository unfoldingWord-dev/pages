\c 23  
\s Job replied again 
\p
\v 1 Then Job replied again, saying this: 
\q
\v 2 “Today I am again complaining bitterly/strongly \add to God\add*;
\q2 I continue groaning, but he \f + \fr synecdoche \f* continues to ◄punish me/cause me to suffer►.
\q
\v 3 I ◄wish that I knew/want to know► where I could meet/talk with him,
\q2 so that I could go to the place where he lives. 
\q
\v 4 If I could do that, I would tell him why \add I know that\add* I am innocent;
\q2 I would tell \f + \fr metonymy \f* to him all my ◄arguments/evidence \add to show that I have not done what is
evil\add*►. 
\q
\v 5 Then I would find out and understand what he would reply to me \f + \fr doublet \f*.
\q
\v 6 Would he use his great power to argue with me? 
\q2 No, he would listen to me carefully. 
\q
\v 7 I am ◄an honest/a righteous► man; so I would be able to discuss things with him
\add fairly\add*, 
\q2 and then he would declare that I am innocent, \add and that decision would
endure\add* forever. 
\b
\q
\v 8 But, I have gone to the east, and he is not there; 
\q2 I have gone to the west, but I have not found him there. 
\q
\v 9 I have gone north and I have gone south, 
\q2 but I have not seen him anywhere. 
\q
\v 10 But he knows how I have conducted my life; 
\q2 and when he has finished testing me, \add he will see that\add* I am as pure as \f + \fr simile \f* gold
\add whose impurities have all been burned out\add*. 
\q
\v 11 I \f + \fr synecdoche \f* have faithfully walked on the road that he showed me;
\q2 I have not turned away from \add obeying\add* him. 
\q
\v 12 I have always obeyed what he \f + \fr synecdoche \f* commanded; 
\q2 I have hidden away in my inner being the words that he has spoken.
\b
\q
\v 13 He never changes. There is no one who can \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* stop him \add from doing what he
desires\add*. 
\q2 Whatever he wants to do, he does. 
\q
\v 14 And he will finish doing the things that he has planned for me;
\q2 \add and I am sure that\add* he has thought about doing many things for me.
\q
\v 15 So I am terrified in his presence; 
\q2 when I think \add about what he can do\add*, I am very afraid \f + \fr doublet \f*.
\q
\v 16 Almighty God has caused me \f + \fr synecdoche \f* to feel timid and terrified \f + \fr doublet \f*.
\q
\v 17  \add It is as though\add* there is only thick darkness in front of me,
\q2 but it is God that I am afraid of, not the darkness.”
