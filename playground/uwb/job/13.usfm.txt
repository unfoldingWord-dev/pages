\c 13  
\s Job continued his reply 
\q
\v 1 “Hey, I [SYN] have seen everything \add that you have seen\add*,
\q2 and I have heard and understood all \add that you have said\add*.
\q
\v 2 What you know, I also know; 
\q2 I do ◄not know less than/know as much as► you. 
\q
\v 3 But I would like to speak to Almighty God, \add not to you\add*;
\q2 I would like to argue with him \add and prove that I ◄am innocent/have not done things that are
wrong\add*►. 
\q
\v 4 As for you, you tell lies \add and do not allow people to know what is the
truth\add*, 
\q2 like someone covers \add up a bad surface of a wall\add* with whitewash [MET].
\q You are all like doctors [MET] that \add give people\add* useless
\add medicines\add*. 
\q
\v 5 I wish/desire that you would be silent; 
\q2 that would be the wisest thing that you \add could do\add*. 
\q
\v 6 Listen to what I will say to you now; 
\q2 listen while I am saying \add what is true about myself\add*.
\q
\v 7 Are you telling lies to help God, 
\q2 and saying what is deceitful in order to benefit him? 
\q
\v 8 Are you trying to defend him? 
\q2 Are you trying to prove in a court that he is innocent? 
\q
\v 9 If he looks closely, will he find that everything that you have done is good?
\q2 Or can you deceive him, like you deceive other people? 
\q
\v 10 If you secretly say/do things to cause God to act favorably toward you,
\q2 he will surely rebuke you. 
\q
\v 11 He will certainly [RHQ] cause you to be terrified by his power/greatness,
\q2 you will become extremely afraid. 
\q
\v 12 The things that you say \add that you think are\add* wise are
\add as useless as\add* [MET] as ashes; 
\q2 what you say to defend yourselves is no better than [MET] clay that quickly crumbles.
\b
\q
\v 13 So, be quiet and allow me to speak, 
\q2 and then it will not matter what happens to me. 
\q
\v 14 I am ready to endure anything; 
\q2 I am even willing to risk being executed [IDI, DOU] \add for what I will
say\add*. 
\q
\v 15 If God kills me, then I will not have anyone else whom I can confidently expect to help me,
\q2 but I am going to defend my behavior in his presence \add anyway\add*.
\q
\v 16 No wicked/godless person would dare to stand in the presence of God,
\q \add but because I say that I have not done things that are wrong\add*,
\q2 perhaps, if I can prove that to God, he will save me.” 
\s Job asks God to tell him what his charges are 
\q
\v 17 “God, listen very carefully to what I say [DOU]. 
\q
\v 18 I am ready to prove that I am innocent, 
\q2 and I know that you also will declare that I am not guilty. 
\q
\v 19 I certainly do not think [RHQ] that \add you or anyone else\add* will say that what I say is not true;
\q2 if anyone did that, I would ◄be silent/stop talking► and die.
\b
\q
\v 20 I am requesting you to do two things for me; 
\q2 if you do them, I will ◄not hide from you/come and stand in front of you► [LIT].
\q
\v 21  \add The first thing that I request is that\add* you stop punishing [IDI] me;
\q2 and \add the second thing that I request is that\add* you stop causing me to be very terrified.
\q
\v 22 You speak first, and then I will reply; 
\q2 or allow me to speak first, and then you reply. 
\q
\v 23 What have I done that is wrong? What sins have I committed?
\q2 Show me how I have disobeyed you. 
\q
\v 24 Why ◄do you refuse to be friendly with/have you abandoned► me [IDI]?
\q2 Why do you ◄act toward me as though I am/consider me to be► your enemy?
\q
\v 25 I am \add as insignificant as\add* [MET] a leaf that the wind blows;
\q2 why are you trying to cause me to be afraid [RHQ]? 
\q Why are you pursuing me? 
\q2 Am I \add useless, nothing more than a bit of\add* dry chaff [RHQ]?
\q
\v 26  \add It seems that\add* you are writing things to accuse me
\add of doing things that are wrong\add*, 
\q2 even recalling bad things that I did when I was young. 
\q
\v 27  \add It is as though\add* you have put my feet ◄in stocks/between wooden blocks to prevent me from walking►,
\q2 and you watch me wherever I walk; 
\q2 \add It is as though\add* you even look closely at my footprints
\add to see where I have gone\add*. 
\q
\v 28 As a result, my body is decaying like [SIM] rotten wood, 
\q2 like a piece of cloth that is eaten by \add larvae of\add* moths.”
