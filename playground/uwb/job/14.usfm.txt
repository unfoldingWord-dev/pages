\c 14  
\s Job prayed to God 
\q
\v 1 “We humans are very frail. 
\q2 We live only a short time, and we experience a lot of trouble.
\q
\v 2 We disappear quickly, like flowers that grow from the ground quickly and then wither and die \f + \fk simile \f*.
\q2 We are like shadows that disappear \add when the sun stops shining\add*.
\q
\v 3  \add Yahweh\add*, why do you keep watching me \add to see if I am doing something that is
wrong\add* \f + \fk rhetorical question \f*? 
\q2 Are you wanting to take me to court to judge me? 
\q
\v 4 People are sinners from the time when they are born; 
\q2 who can cause them to be sinless? No one \f + \fk rhetorical question \f*! 
\q
\v 5 You have decided how long our lives will be. 
\q2 You have decided how many months we will live, 
\q2 and we cannot live more months than the ◄limit/number of months► that you have decided.
\q
\v 6 So please stop examining us, and allow us to be alone, 
\q2 until/while we finish our time \add here on earth\add*, like a man finishes his work
\add at the end of the day\add*. 
\s Job said that we all die 
\q
\v 7 If we cut a tree down, 
\q2 \add sometimes\add* we hope that it will sprout again and grow new branches.
\q
\v 8 Its roots in the ground may be very old, 
\q2 and its stump may decay, 
\q
\v 9 but if some water falls on it, 
\q2 it may bud/sprout and send up shoots like a young plant. 
\q
\v 10 But when we people lose all our strength and die, 
\q2 we stop breathing and then we are gone \add forever\add*. 
\q
\v 11 Just like water evaporates from the ocean, 
\q2 or like a riverbed dries up, 
\q
\v 12 people sometimes \add lie down and die\add* and do not get up again.
\q Until the heavens disappear, 
\q2 people who die \f + \fk euphemism \f* do not wake up, 
\q2 and no one can wake them up. 
\b
\q
\v 13  \add Yahweh\add*, I wish that you would put me safely in the place of the dead and forget about me
\q2 until you are no longer angry with me. 
\q I wish that you would decide how much time I would spend there,
\q2 and then remember that I \add am there\add*. 
\q
\v 14 When we humans die, we will certainly not live again \f + \fk rhetorical question \f*.
\q2 If \add I knew that\add* we would live again, I would wait patiently,
\q2 and I would wait for you to release me \add from my sufferings\add*.
\q
\v 15 You would call me, and I would answer. 
\q2 You would be eager to see me, one of the creatures that you had made.
\q
\v 16 You would take care of \f + \fk metaphor \f* me, 
\q2 instead of watching me to see if I would sin. 
\q
\v 17  \add The record of\add* my sins would be sealed in a small bag,
\q2 and you would cover them up. 
\b
\q
\v 18 But, just like mountains crumble and rocks fall down from a cliff,
\q
\v 19 and just like water slowly wears away the stones, and just like floods wash away soil,
\q2 you \add eventually destroy us\add*; you do not allow us to continue to ◄hope/confidently expect►
\add that we will keep on living\add*. 
\q
\v 20 You always defeat us, and then we die \f + \fk euphemism \f*. 
\q2 You cause our faces to look ugly after we die, 
\q2 and you send us away. 
\q
\v 21  \add When we die\add* we do not know if our sons will grow up and
\add do things that will cause\add* them to be honored. 
\q2 And if they become disgraced, we do not see that, either. 
\q
\v 22 We will feel our own pains; we will not feel anything else;
\q2 we will be sorry for ourselves, not for anyone else.”
