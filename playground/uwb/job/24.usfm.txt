\c 24  
\s Job continued his reply 
\q
\v 1 “◄Why does Almighty \add God\add* not set a time when he will judge
\add evil people\add*?/I do not understand why Almighty \add God
does\add* not set a time when he will judge \add evil people\add*.► \f + \fk rhetorical question \f*
\q2 Those who know him never \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* see him do that! 
\q
\v 2  \add Some evil people\add* remove the markers of \add boundaries of other people's land, in order to steal their
land\add*; 
\q2 they seize/steal \add other people's\add* sheep and put them in their own pastures.
\q
\v 3  \add Some\add* ◄take away/steal► the donkeys that belong to orphans,
\q2 and they take widow's oxen to guarantee that the widows will pay back the money that they loaned to those widows.
\q
\v 4  \add Some\add* shove poor people off the road \f + \ft (OR, prevent poor people from ◄obtaining their rights/being treated
justly►), 
\q2 and they force poor people to find places to hide from them.
\q
\v 5 The result is that poor people have to search for food in the desert
\q2 like wild donkeys do. 
\q
\v 6 The poor people harvest left-over grain in other people's fields,
\q2 and gather grapes from vineyards that belong to wicked men. 
\q
\v 7 During the night they have nothing to cover their bodies, 
\q2 nothing to keep them warm. 
\q
\v 8 When it rains on the mountains, they become very wet, 
\q2 so they huddle under the rock ledges to be protected \add from the
rain\add*. 
\q
\v 9  \add Some evil men\add* snatch infants away from their mothers \f + \fk synecdoche \f*,
\q2 and they say ‘I will return your babies to you when you repay the money that I lent to you.’
\q
\v 10 But the poor people walk around with no clothes on; 
\q2 they are hungry while they are working to carry \add other people's\add* bundles of grain
\add to the places where their grain will be threshed\add*. 
\q
\v 11 Poor people press olives to make \add olive\add* oil; 
\q2 they tread on grapes to make \add juice for wine\add*, 
\q2 but \add they are not allowed to drink any of it when\add* they become thirsty.
\q
\v 12 In the cities, people who are wounded and dying cry out \add to God for
help\add*, 
\q2 but God does not heed their prayers. 
\b
\q
\v 13 Some wicked people avoid the light \add because they do evil things in the
dark\add*; 
\q2 they do not walk on roads that are lighted. 
\q
\v 14 Murderers steal things during the night, 
\q2 and then they arise before dawn in order that they may go out again and kill poor and needy \f + \fk doublet \f* people.
\q
\v 15 Those who want to commit adultery wait for twilight/evening;
\q2 they say ‘I do not want anyone to see me,’ so they keep their faces covered.
\q
\v 16 It is during the night that robbers break into houses \add to steal
things\add*, 
\q2 but during the day they hide because they want to avoid \add being
seen\add* in the light. 
\q
\v 17 All of those \add people\add* want to do their evil deeds at night, not in the morning
\add when it is light\add*, 
\q2 because they are not afraid of \add the things that happen during
the\add* night that terrify others.” 
\s (Final speech by Zophar) \f* 
\q
\v 18 “\add But it is wicked people who\add* are swept/carried away by floods,
\q2 and God curses the land that they own, 
\q2 and no one goes to work in their vineyards. 
\q
\v 19 Just like the snow melts away when it is hot and there is no rain,
\q2 those who have sinned disappear into the place where the dead people are.
\q
\v 20 Not even their mothers remember them now; 
\q2 wicked people are destroyed like trees that are cut down, 
\q2 and maggots eat their corpses. 
\q
\v 21 They mistreat women who have been unable to give birth to children and women who no longer have children
\add to take care of them\add*, 
\q2 and they never do good things for widows. 
\q
\v 22 But God, by his power, gets rid of mighty/influential people.
\q2 God acts and causes the wicked people to die. 
\q
\v 23 God allows them to think that they are secure and safe, 
\q2 but he is watching \f + \fk metonymy \f* them all the time. 
\q
\v 24 They prosper for a little while, 
\q2 and then \add suddenly\add* they are gone; 
\q2 they disappear like weeds wither and die; 
\q2 they are like \f + \fk simile \f* stalks of grain that have been cut off. 
\q
\v 25 If this is not true, is there \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* anyone who will show that I am a liar
\q2 and prove that what I have said is not true?”
