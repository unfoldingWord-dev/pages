\s Job replied to the three friends again 
\p
\v 1 Job replied \add to Eliphaz and the others:\add* 
\q
\v 2 “I have heard things like that before; 
\q2 all of you, \add instead of helping me\add*, are only causing me to feel more miserable.
\q
\v 3 Will your speeches, which are only wind, never end \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*? 
\q2 Eliphaz, what bothers\f + \ft Or: irritates \f* you very much with the result that you continue replying to me?
\q
\v 4  \add If it were you three and not I who were suffering\add*,
\q2 I could say the things that you are saying; 
\q I could make great speeches \add to criticize\f + \ft Or: condemn \f* you\add*,
\q2 and I could shake my head at you \add to ridicule you\add*. 
\q
\v 5 But, \add unlike all of you\add*, with what I said \f + \ft metonymy \f* I would encourage you
\q2 and try to cause your pain to be less. 
\b
\q
\v 6 But now, if I talk, my pain does not decrease, 
\q2 and if I am silent, my pain still certainly does not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* go away.
\q
\v 7 God has now taken away all my strength, 
\q2 and he has destroyed all my family. 
\q
\v 8 He has shriveled me up, 
\q2 and people think that shows that I \add am a sinner\add*. 
\q And people see that I am only skin and bones, 
\q2 and they think that proves that I \add am guilty\add*. 
\q
\v 9 Because God is very angry with me and hates me, 
\q2 \add it is as though he is a wild animal that\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* has gnashed his teeth at me
\q2 because he is my enemy. 
\q
\v 10 People gape\f + \ft Or: stare \f* at me with their mouths open \add to sneer at
me\add*; 
\q2 they have struck me on the face\f + \ft Or: cheek \f* to ridicule me, 
\q2 and they crowd around me to \add threaten\add* me. 
\q
\v 11  \add It is as though\add* God has handed me over to ungodly people
\q2 and put me into the hands of the wicked \f + \ft doublet \f*. 
\q
\v 12 Previously, I was living peacefully, 
\q2 but he crushed me; 
\q \add it is as though\add* he grabbed my neck and smashed me to pieces.
\q2 \add It is as though\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* he set me up like a target 
\q
\v 13 and people are surrounding me \add and shooting arrows at me\add*.
\q His arrows pierce my kidneys 
\q2 and cause the bile \add from my liver\add* to spill onto the ground,
\q2 and God does not pity me at all. 
\q
\v 14  \add It is as though\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* I am a wall that he is breaking through;
\q2 he rushes at me like \f + \ft simile \f* a soldier \add attacking his enemies\add*.
\b
\q
\v 15  \add Because I am mourning\add*, I wear pieces of rough cloth that I have sewed together,
\q2 and I sit here in the dirt, very depressed\f + \ft Or: discouraged \f*. 
\q
\v 16 My face is red because I have cried very much, 
\q2 and there are dark circles around my eyes. 
\q
\v 17  \add All this has happened to me\add* even though I have not acted violently toward anyone,
\q2 and I always pray sincerely\f + \ft Or: honestly \f* to God. 
\b
\q
\v 18  \add When I die\add*, I want the ground \f + \ft apostrophe \f* to \add act as though I had been murdered
and\add* cry out against those who killed me, 
\q2 and I do not want anyone to stop me while I am demanding \add that God act justly
toward\add* me. 
\q
\v 19 But even now, \add I know that\add* there is someone in heaven who will testify for me,
\q2 and he will say that what I have done is right. 
\q
\v 20 My \add three\add* friends scorn\f + \ft Or: ridicule \f* me, 
\q2 but my eyes are full of tears \add while I cry out\add* to God.
\q
\v 21 I pray that the one \add who knows what I have done\add* would come to plead with God for me
\q2 like people plead for their friends. 
\b
\q
\v 22  \add I say this\add* because within a few years \add I will
die\add*; 
\q2 I will walk along the road from which I will never return.”
