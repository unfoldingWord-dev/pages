\c 30  
\s Job ridicules the fathers of young men 
\q
\v 1 “But now men who are younger than I am make fun of me— 
\q2 men whose fathers I greatly despised, 
\q2 with the result that I would not even have allowed them to help my dogs guard my sheep.
\q
\v 2 They were men who were old and ◄weak/worn out►; 
\q2 so ◄what could I gain from them working for me?/I would have gained nothing from them working for me.► \f + \fk rhetorical question \f*
\q
\v 3 They were very poor and hungry, 
\q2 with the result that they chewed on roots \add at night\add*
\q2 in dry and desolate places. 
\q
\v 4 They pulled up plants in the desert \add and ate them\add* 
\q2 and warmed themselves \add by burning\add* the roots of broom trees.
\q
\v 5 Everyone shouted at them as though they were thieves 
\q2 and expelled them \add from their areas\add*. 
\q
\v 6 They were forced to live in caves in the hills, 
\q2 in holes in the ground, and in the sides of cliffs. 
\q
\v 7 In the bushes they howled \add like animals because they were
hungry\add*, 
\q2 and they huddled together under thornbushes. 
\q
\v 8 They were people without good sense, 
\q2 whose names no one knows; 
\q they have been expelled from the land \add where they were born\add*.
\s Job stated how he was despised 
\q
\v 9 Now their \add children\add* sing songs to make fun of me. 
\q2 They tell jokes about me. 
\q
\v 10 They are disgusted with me, and they \add usually\add* stay away from me,
\q2 \add but when they see me\add*, they are happy to spit in my face.
\q
\v 11 Because \add it is as though\add* \f + \fk metaphor \f* God has cut my bowstring,
\add he has caused me to be unable to defend myself\add*, and he has humbled me,
\q2 and my enemies have done to me whatever they wanted. 
\q
\v 12 ◄Gangs/Groups of violent youths► attack me and force me to run away;
\q2 they prepare to destroy me. 
\q
\v 13 They prevent me from escaping, 
\q2 and \add they do not need\add* anyone to help them \f + \ft (OR, there is no one to help me) \f*.
\q
\v 14  \add It is as though I am a city wall and\add* \f + \fk simile \f* they have broken through the wall,
\q2 and they have come crashing down on me. 
\q
\v 15 I am very terrified; 
\q2 My dignity/honor has been taken away as though \f + \fk simile \f* \add it has
been\add* blown away by the wind, 
\q2 and my prosperity has disappeared like \f + \fk simile \f* clouds disappear.
\s Job stated that God also mistreated him 
\q
\v 16 And now I \f + \fk synecdoche \f* am about to die [IDI]; 
\q2 I suffer every day. 
\q
\v 17 My bones ache during the nights, 
\q2 and the pain that torments me never stops. 
\q
\v 18  \add It is as though God\add* seizes my clothes 
\q2 and chokes me with the collar of my coat. 
\q
\v 19 He has thrown me into the mud; 
\q2 I am \add not worth anything more than\add* dust and ashes. 
\b
\q
\v 20 I cry out to God, but he does not answer/help me; 
\q2 I stand up \add and pray\add*, but he does not pay any attention.
\q
\v 21 He acts very cruelly toward me; 
\q2 with all of his power \f + \fk metonymy \f* he causes me to suffer. 
\q
\v 22 He \add allows\add* the wind to lift me up and blow me away,
\q2 and he tosses me up and down in a violent storm. 
\q
\v 23 I know that he will cause me to die, 
\q2 which is what happens to everyone \f + \fk metonymy \f* who is alive. 
\b
\q
\v 24 When people experience disasters, 
\q2 and they sit on a pile of ruins and cry out for help, 
\q2 others surely \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* reach out their hand to help them. 
\q
\v 25  \add That is what I did\add*. I wept for people who were experiencing troubles,
\q2 and I felt sorry for poor/needy people. 
\q
\v 26 But when I expected good things \add to happen to me\add*, evil things happened;
\q2 when I waited for light/happiness, all I received was darkness/unhappiness \f + \fk metaphor \f*.
\q
\v 27 I am very distressed [IDI], all the time; 
\q2 I suffer every day. 
\q
\v 28 I go about very discouraged; 
\q2 I stand up and plead for people to help me. 
\q
\v 29 My wailing is as sad as \f + \fk metaphor \f* the cries of jackals/foxes and ostriches.
\q
\v 30 My skin has become dark/black and is peeling off, 
\q2 and I have a fever \add which causes my body to feel like it
is\add* burning. 
\q
\v 31 Previously, I played joyful music on my harp and with my flute,
\q2 but now I play only the sad music of those who mourn.”
