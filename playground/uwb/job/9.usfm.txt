\c 9  
\s Job replied to Bildad 
\p
\v 1 Then Job replied, 
\q
\v 2 “Yes, I certainly know that \add much of\add* what you said is true.
\q2 But ◄how can anyone say to God, ‘I ‘am innocent\f + \ft Or: have \f* not done what is wrong’ and prove it?’\f + \ft Or: no \f* one can say to God ‘I ‘am
innocent\f + \ft Or: have \f* not done what is wrong’ and prove it.’► \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* 
\q
\v 3 If someone wanted to argue with God \add about that\add*, 
\q2 God could ask him a thousand questions 
\q2 and that person would not be able to answer any of them! 
\q
\v 4 God is very wise [IDI] and very powerful; 
\q2 no one who has tried to argue against God has been able to win.
\q
\v 5 He even moves mountains, without them \f + \ft Or: anyone \f* knowing about it.
\q2 When he is angry, he turns them upside down. 
\q
\v 6 He sends earthquakes that shake the ground; 
\q2 he causes the pillars that support the earth to tremble. 
\q
\v 7  \add Some days\add* he speaks to the sun, and it does not rise,
\q2 and \add some nights\add* he prevents the stars from shining.
\q
\v 8 He alone stretched out\f + \ft Or: put in place \f* the sky; 
\q2 he alone puts his feet on the waves \f + \ft Or: on the huge sea monster \f*.
\q
\v 9 He put in their places \add the clusters\f + \ft Or: groups \f* of stars that are
called\add* The Dipper\f + \ft Or: Bear \f*, Orion, the Pleiades, and the stars in the southern sky.
\q
\v 10 Only he does great things that we cannot understand; 
\q2 he does more marvelous things than we are able to count. 
\q
\v 11 He passes by where I am, but I do not see him; 
\q2 he moves further on, but I do not see him go. 
\q
\v 12 If he \add wants to\add* snatch something away, no one \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* can hinder him;
\q2 no one dares to ask him, ‘Why are you doing that?’ \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* 
\q
\v 13 God will not very easily stop being angry; 
\q2 he defeated \f + \ft metonymy \f* those who \add tried to\add* help Rahab, \add the great sea
monster\add*. 
\b
\q
\v 14 So, \add if God took me to court\add*, 
\q2 what could I say \f + \ft metonymy \f* to answer him? 
\q
\v 15 Even though I would be innocent\f + \ft Or: would not have done what is wrong \f*, I would not be able to answer him.
\q2 All I could do would be to request God, my judge\f + \ft Or: accuser \f*, to act mercifully toward me.
\q
\v 16 If I summoned him to \add come to the courtroom\add* and he said that he would come,
\q2 I would not believe that he would pay attention to what I would say.
\q
\v 17 He sends storms to batter me, 
\q2 and he bruises me many times without any reason to do that\f + \ft Or: even though I am innocent \f*.
\q
\v 18  \add It is as though\add* he will not let me get\f + \ft Or: catch \f* my breath,
\q2 because he causes me to suffer all the time. 
\q
\v 19 If I would try to wrestle with\f + \ft Or: fight against \f* him, \add there is no way that I could
defeat\add* him, 
\q2 because he is stronger than I am. 
\q If I would request him to appear in court, 
\q2 there is no one who could \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* force him to go there. 
\q
\v 20 Even though I was innocent, what I would say would cause him to say that I must be punished \f + \ft metonymy \f*;
\q2 even though I had not done anything wrong, he would prove that I am guilty.
\b
\q
\v 21 I have not done what is wrong, but that is not important. 
\q2 I despise continuing to remain alive. 
\q
\v 22 Nothing is important to me, 
\q2 because God will get rid of \add all of us\add*, both those who are innocent and those who are wicked.
\q
\v 23 When people experience disaster and it causes them to suddenly die,
\q2 God laughs at it, even if they are innocent. 
\q
\v 24 God has allowed wicked people to control \add what happens
in\add* the world. 
\q2 \add It is as though\add* he has caused judges to be blind, \add with the result that they cannot judge
fairly\add*. 
\q If it is not God who has done that, 
\q2 who has done it? 
\b
\q
\v 25 My days pass very quickly, like a fast runner; 
\q2 \add it is as though\add* they run away, and nothing good happens to me on those days.
\q
\v 26 My life goes by very rapidly, like a boat made from reeds sailing swiftly,
\q2 or like an eagle that swoops down to seize a small animal. 
\q
\v 27 If I smile and say \add to God\add*, ‘I will forget what I am complaining about;
\q2 I will stop looking sad and try to be cheerful\f + \ft Or: happy \f*,’ 
\q
\v 28 then I become afraid because of all that I am suffering 
\q2 because I know that God does not consider that I am innocent.
\q
\v 29 He will condemn me\f + \ft Or: declare that I should be punished \f*, 
\q2 so why should I keep trying in vain \add to defend myself\add*?
\q
\v 30 If I washed myself with snow 
\q2 or cleansed my hands with lye\f + \ft Or: soap \f* 
\q2 \add to get rid of my guilt\add*, 
\q
\v 31 he would still throw me into a filthy pit; 
\q2 as a result \add it would be as though\add* even my clothes would detest me.
\b
\q
\v 32 God is not a human, as I am, 
\q2 so there is no way that I could answer him \add to prove that I am
innocent\add* 
\q2 if we went together to have a trial \add in a courtroom\add*.
\q
\v 33 There is no one to mediate\f + \ft Or: hear us and decide who is right \f*,
\q2 no one who has authority over both of us [IDI]. 
\q
\v 34 I wish\f + \ft Or: desire \f* that he would stop punishing \f + \ft metonymy \f* me, 
\q2 and that he would not continue to terrify me. 
\q
\v 35 If he did that, I would declare \add that I am innocent\add* without being afraid of him,
\q2 because I know within myself that I really have not \add done what is wrong like God thinks that I
have\add*.”
