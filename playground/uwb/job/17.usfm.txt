\c 17  
\s Job continued his reply 
\q
\v 1 "My time to live is almost ended; I have no strength left; 
\q2 my grave is waiting for me. 
\q
\v 2 Those who are around me are making fun of me; 
\q2 I \f + \ft synecdoche \f* watch them while they taunt\f + \ft Or: belittle \f* me." 
\s Job pleads with God 
\q
\v 3 "God, \add it is as though I am in prison\add*; 
\q please pay the money in order that I may be released, 
\q2 because there is certainly no one else who will help me. 
\q
\v 4 You have prevented my friends from understanding \add what is true about
me\add*; 
\q2 do not allow them to triumph over me, \add saying that I have done things that are
wrong\add*. 
\q
\v 5  \add Our ancestors often said, 'It often happens that\add* when someone betrays his friends in order to get some of their
property, 
\q2 it is that person's children who will be punished for it;' 
\q \add so I desire\f + \ft Or: hope \f* that will be true of these friends of mine who are lying about
me\add*. 
\b
\q
\v 6 But now people use that saying of our ancestors when they talk about me;
\q2 they spit in my face \add to insult me\add*. 
\q
\v 7 My eyes have become dim\f + \ft Or: I cannot see well \f* because I am extremely sad,
\q2 and my arms and legs are \add very thin, with the result that they almost do not
cast\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* a shadow. 
\q
\v 8 Those who \add say that they\add* are good\f + \ft Or: righteous \f* are shocked
\add when they see what has happened to me\add*, 
\q2 and people who \add say that they\add* are innocent\f + \ft Or: have not done anything that is wrong \f* say that I am wicked, Or: godless and
should be punished. 
\q
\v 9 Those who \add claim that they\add* are righteous will continue to do what
\add they think\add* is right, 
\q2 and those who \add say that it is as though their\add* hands are clean
\add because they have not sinned\add* will continue to become stronger.
\b
\q
\v 10 But even if all of those people came \add and stood in front of
me\add*, 
\q2 I would not find one among them who is wise. 
\q
\v 11 My time to live is almost ended; I have not been able to do the things that I planned to do;
\q2 \add I have not been able to accomplish anything that\add* I \f + \ft synecdoche \f* desired.
\q
\v 12 My friends do not know when it is night and when it is day;
\q2 when it is night, they claim that it is daylight; 
\q2 when it is becoming dark, they claim it is becoming light. 
\q
\v 13 I may say that my home will be the place where dead people are,
\q2 where I will sleep in the darkness. 
\q
\v 14 I may say to the grave, 'Where I am buried will be \add like\add* a father to me.'
\q2 I may say to the maggots, 'You will be \add like\add* a mother or younger sisters to me
\add because that is where I will always be\add*.' 
\q
\v 15 But if I say those things, will there be anything good that I can confidently expect to happen to me?\f + \ft Or: there will be
nothing good that I can confidently expect to happen to me. \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\q2 Is there anyone who knows anything good that I can expect when I am there?\f + \ft Or: No one knows anything good that I can expect
when I am there. \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* 
\q
\v 16 After I descend to the place where the dead are, will I be able to confidently expect anything good there?\f + \ft Or: I certainly
will not be able to confidently expect anything good there. \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\q2 \add It will be as though\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* I and the things I hope for will descend with me into the dust."
