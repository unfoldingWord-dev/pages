\c 42  
\s Job replied to Yahweh 
\p
\v 1 Then Job replied to Yahweh. He said, 
\q
\v 2 “I know that you can do everything 
\q2 and that no one can stop you from doing what you want to do.
\q
\v 3  \add You asked me\add*, ‘◄Who are you, who by speaking ignorantly, question what I plan to do?/You have no right to
question what I plan to do by speaking ignorantly.►’ \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* 
\q2 It is true that I spoke about things that I did not understand,
\q2 things that are very wonderful/marvelous, 
\q2 and therefore I am not able to know them. 
\q
\v 4 You said to me, ‘Listen while I talk to you. 
\q2 I want to ask you some questions, 
\q2 so prepare yourself to answer them.’ 
\q
\v 5 I had heard about you previously, 
\q2 but now \add it is as though\add* I have seen you with my own eyes.
\q
\v 6 Therefore I ◄am ashamed of/withdraw► what I said, 
\q2 and I sit in dust and ashes to show that I am sorry \add for what I
said\add*.” 
\s Yahweh said he disapproved of what Job's three friends said 
\p
\v 7 After Yahweh said these things to Job, he said to Eliphaz, “I am angry with you and your two friends,
\add Bildad and Zophar\add*, because what my servant Job said about me was right/true, but what you have spoken about me was
not right/true. 
\v 8 So now you must take to Job seven young bulls and seven rams and
\add kill them and\add* burn them on the altar as a sacrifice for yourselves. Then Job will pray for you, and I will do what he
requests me to do, \add and I will forgive you for speaking wrongly about
me\add*. I will not punish you, even though you deserve to be punished, because what you said about me was not right/true, but
what Job said about me was right/true.” 
\p
\v 9 So Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar did what Yahweh commanded them to do, and Yahweh did what Job requested him to do
\add for the three of them\add*. 
\s Yahweh blessed Job again 
\p
\v 10 After Job prayed for his three friends, Yahweh \add healed him
and\add* caused him to become rich again. Yahweh gave him twice as many things as he had before.
\v 11 Then all his brothers and sisters, and all the people who had known him before, came to his house, and they ate a meal
together. They consoled/comforted \f + \fr doublet \f* him because of all the troubles that Yahweh had allowed to happen to him. Each of them
gave him a piece of silver and a gold ring. 
\p
\v 12 Then Yahweh blessed Job in the second half of his life more than he had blessed him in the first half of his life. He now
acquired/owned 14,000 sheep, 6,000 camels, 2,000 oxen, and 1,000 female donkeys.
\v 13 And he also had seven more sons and three more daughters. 
\v 14 He named the first daughter Jemimah, he named the second daughter Keziah, and he named the third daughter Keren-Happuch.
\v 15 In all of \add Uz\add* land there were no young women who were as beautiful as the daughters of Job, and Job declared
that they would inherit some of his possessions, just like their brothers would inherit some.
\p
\v 16 After that, Job lived 140 more years. Before he died, he ◄saw/enjoyed being with► his great-great-grandchildren.
\v 17 He was very old \f + \fr doublet \f* when he died.
