\s Zophar replied again 
\p
\v 1 Then Zophar replied again, saying this: 
\q
\v 2 “I am very perturbed about what you have said, 
\q2 so I want to reply very quickly. 
\q
\v 3 By saying these things you have insulted me, 
\q2 but I know how \f + \fr (OR, because I understand very much) \f* I can reply to you.
\b
\q
\v 4 Do you not know that from long ago, 
\q2 ever since people were first put on the earth, 
\q
\v 5 that wicked people \add like you\add* do not continue to rejoice for a long time,
\q2 that ungodly people are happy only for a ◄moment/very short time► \f + \fr hyperbole \f*?
\q
\v 6 Even though their \add reputation/pride\add* reaches up to the sky
\q2 and their fame goes up as high as the clouds, 
\q
\v 7 they will disappear forever, like their own dung, 
\q2 and those who knew them will ask, ‘◄Where did they go/What happened to them►?’
\q
\v 8 They will disappear like \f + \fr simile \f* a dream does, 
\q2 and they will exist no more. 
\q They will vanish, like visions \add that people see during\add* the night.
\q
\v 9 Those who saw those people previously will never see them again,
\q2 even \add the people who lived in\add* their houses \f + \fr metonymy \f* will not see them anymore.
\q
\v 10 Their children will be forced to return the valuable things that they stole from poor people \f + \fr doublet \f*.
\q
\v 11 Previously their bodies were young and strong, 
\q2 but they will die and \add their bodies will\add* be buried in the ground.
\b
\q
\v 12 Although doing wicked things was like having sweet food in their mouths,
\q2 and they wanted to continue to taste it, 
\q
\v 13 and even though they did not want to stop doing those things,
\q
\v 14 some day the evil things that they enjoyed doing will become like food
\add that they swallow\add* 
\q2 \add and become\add* as bitter as snake poison. 
\q
\v 15 Wicked people do not continue to keep the money they have accumulated
\q2 like people do not keep the food that they vomit. 
\q God takes their wealth from them. 
\q
\v 16 What wicked people do is \add like\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f* swallowing snake poison;
\q2 it will kill them like \f + \fr metaphor \f* the bite of a poisonous snake kills people.
\q
\v 17 They will not remain alive to see the abundant blessings [IDI]
\add from God\add* 
\q2 that are like \f + \fr metaphor \f* a stream that flows by. 
\q
\v 18 They will be forced to give back the things that they stole from the poor;
\q2 they will not be able to continue to enjoy those things. 
\q They will not remain happy because of what they got from their businesses,
\q
\v 19 because they oppressed poor people and refused to help them,
\q2 and they took other people's houses \add by cheating them\add*.
\b
\q
\v 20 They were always greedy and never satisfied. 
\q2 And when they ate, they ate so much that they never saved anything that they enjoyed.
\q
\v 21 When they finished eating their food, there was never anything left over
\add because they had greedily eaten it all\add*; 
\q2 but now their prosperity will end. 
\q
\v 22 When they are extremely prosperous/wealthy, 
\q2 they will suddenly experience a lot of trouble. 
\q2 ◄Misery will strike them and crush them \f + \fr personification \f*/They will suffer very greatly►.
\q
\v 23 When the wicked people are filling their stomachs, 
\q2 God will show that he is very angry with them and punish them;
\q2 the punishment that he \add gives them\add* will fall on them like \f + \fr metaphor \f* rain.
\q
\v 24 They will try to escape from \add being killed by\add* iron weapons,
\q2 but arrows with bronze points will pierce them. 
\q
\v 25 The arrows will \add go completely through their bodies and\add* stick out of their backs;
\q2 the shiny points of the arrows will have blood dripping from them,
\q2 and those wicked people will be terrified. 
\q
\v 26 Their valuable possessions will all be destroyed; 
\q2 a fire that is not lit by humans, \add but from God\add*, will burn them up
\q2 and also destroy the things that are left in their tents. 
\q
\v 27 The \add angels in\add* heaven \f + \fr metonymy \f* will reveal the sins that those wicked people have committed,
\q2 and \add people on\add* earth will stand up and testify against them.
\q
\v 28 On the day when God punishes \f + \fr metonymy \f* people, 
\q2 all the possessions in the wicked people's houses will be carried away by a flood.
\q
\v 29 That is what will happen to wicked people \add like you\add*;
\q2 that is what God has decreed/assigned for them.”
