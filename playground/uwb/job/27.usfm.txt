\s Job replied one more time 
\p
\v 1 Job replied again \add to his three friends\add*, by saying this:
\q
\v 2 “Almighty God has refused to treat me justly\f + \ft Or: fairly \f*. 
\q2 He has caused me to feel bitter\f + \ft Or: resentful \f*. 
\q2 But just as surely as he lives, 
\q
\v 3 as long as God's Spirit enables me to breathe, 
\q
\v 4 I will not lie; 
\q2 I \\f + \\ft synecdoche \\f* will not say anything to deceive anyone. 
\q
\v 5 I will never admit that what you \add three\add* have said is true;
\q2 until the day that I die, I will insist that I have not done things that are wrong.
\q
\v 6 I will say that I am innocent, and never ◄say anything different\f + \ft Or: change \f* what I say►;
\q2 my inner being will never reproach me as long as I live. 
\b
\q
\v 7 I want my enemies to be \add punished\add* like all the wicked people are punished;
\q2 I want\f + \ft Or: hope \f* that \add God will punish\add* those who oppose me like
\add he punishes all\add* unrighteous people. 
\q
\v 8 When \add it is time for God to\add* get rid of godless\f + \ft Or: wicked \f* people and to cause them to die,
\q2 there is absolutely nothing good \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* that they can confidently expect
\add to happen to them\add*. 
\q
\v 9 When they experience troubles, ◄will God hear them call out
\add to him for help\add*?\f + \ft Or: God \f* certainly will not hear them call out
\add to him for help\add*.► \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* 
\q
\v 10 ◄Will they be happy about what Almighty \add God\add* does?\f + \ft Or: They \f* certainly will not be happy about what Almighty
\add God\add* does.► \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* 
\q2 ◄Will they \add begin to\add* pray to him frequently?\f + \ft Or: They \f* certainly will not
\add begin to\add* pray to him frequently.► \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* 
\q2 \add Certainly not\add*! 
\b
\q
\v 11 I will teach you \add three\add* something about the power \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* of Almighty God \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f*;
\q2 I will reveal what he is thinking. 
\q
\v 12 But you \add three\add* have seen for yourselves \add what God has
done\add*; 
\q2 so ◄why are you saying such nonsense?\f + \ft Or: you \f* should not be saying such nonsense.► \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f*
\b
\q
\v 13  \add I will tell you\add* what Almighty God does to wicked people,
\q2 the things that people who oppress others receive from him. 
\q
\v 14 Even if they have many children, many of those children will die in wars \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f*,
\q2 and their other children will \add die because they do\add* not have enough food to eat.
\q
\v 15 Their children who are still alive will die from diseases,
\q2 and their widows will not even mourn for them. 
\q
\v 16 Sometimes wicked people accumulate a huge amount \\f + \\ft simile \\f* of silver
\q2 and pile up clothes like \\f + \\ft simile \\f* those clothes were a pile of clay,
\q
\v 17 but \add those wicked people will die, and then\add* righteous people will wear those clothes,
\q2 and honest\f + \ft Or: innocent \f* people will get their silver and divide it
\add among themselves\add*. 
\q
\v 18 The houses that they build are \add as frail\f + \ft Or: fragile \f*\add* as \\f + \\ft simile \\f* spider webs,
\q2 or they are like flimsy huts that watchmen live in while they guard people's fields.
\q
\v 19 The wicked people are rich when they lie down \add at night\add*,
\q2 but when they wake up \add in the morning\add*, they find out that their money has disappeared.
\b
\q
\v 20 Things that terrify them \\f + \\ft personification \\f* strike them like a flood \\f + \\ft simile \\f*;
\q2 during the night a whirlwind carries them away. 
\q
\v 21  \add It is as though\add* the wind from the east picks them up and carries them away from their homes,
\q2 and they disappear. 
\q
\v 22 That wind strikes them without pitying them 
\q2 while they are running away, trying to escape from its force\f + \ft Or: power \f* \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f*.
\q
\v 23 That wind is like someone clapping his hands \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* at them
\add to ridicule them\add*, 
\q2 howling at them wherever they run to.”
