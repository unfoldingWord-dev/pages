\c 34  
\s Elihu continued his challenge 
\p
\v 1 Then Elihu \add continued by\add* saying this: 
\q
\v 2 "You men who \add think that you\add* \f + \ft sarcasm \f* are very wise, hear me;
\q2 listen to what I am saying, you men who \add say that\add* you know so much.
\q
\v 3 And when we \f + \ft synecdoche \f* hear what other people \add like you\add* say,
\q2 we \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* think carefully about what they say \add to determine what is good and what is
bad\add*, 
\q2 like we \f + \ft synecdoche \f* taste food \add to determine what is good\add*.
\q
\v 4 We need to decide \add who is saying\add* what is right 
\q2 and to determine among ourselves what is good\f + \ft Or: best \f*. 
\q
\v 5 Job has said, 'I am innocent, 
\q2 but God has refused to judge me fairly\f + \ft Or: justly \f*. 
\q
\v 6 Even though I have always done what is right, 
\q2 he is lying about me. 
\q Even though I have not done what is wrong, 
\q2 he has caused me to suffer, and I will certainly die.' 
\q
\v 7 Is there any person like Job, who insults others as easily as people accept a drink of water?\f + \ft Or: There is no person like
Job, who insults others as easily as people accept a drink of water. \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\q
\v 8 He habitually associates with people who do what is evil 
\q2 and spends time with wicked people. 
\q
\v 9 He has said, 'It is useless for people to try to please God.'
\b
\q
\v 10 So, you men who \add claim that you\add* understand everything, listen to me!
\q Almighty God would never consider doing anything that is wicked or wrong \f + \ft doublet \f*!
\q
\v 11 He pays back\f + \ft Or: punishes \f* people for what they have done; 
\q2 he gives them what they deserve for the way that they have conducted their lives.
\q
\v 12 Truly, Almighty God never does what is wicked; 
\q2 he always \f + \ft litotes \f* does what is fair\f + \ft Or: just \f*. 
\q
\v 13 The authority that he has to rule everything on the earth, no one \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* gave it to him;
\q2 no one \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* put him in control of the whole world. 
\q2 \add He has always had that authority\add*. 
\q
\v 14 If he would take his spirit back to himself, 
\q
\v 15 everyone would die \add immediately\add*, 
\q2 and their corpses would soon become dirt again. 
\b
\q
\v 16 So, \add Job\add*, if \add you say that you\add* understand everything,
\q2 listen to what I am saying. 
\q
\v 17 God could certainly not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* govern the world if he hated doing what is fair\f + \ft Or: just \f*.
\q2 So, will you condemn God, who is righteous and powerful, \add saying that what he has done is
wrong\add*? 
\q
\v 18 He tells \add some\add* kings that they are worthless, 
\q2 and he says to \add some\add* officials that they are wicked.
\q
\v 19 He does not favor rulers \add more than he favors others\add*;
\q2 he does not favor rich people more than poor people, 
\q2 because he created all of them. 
\q
\v 20 They \add often\add* die suddenly; 
\q2 he strikes them at midnight and they die; 
\q2 he gets rid of mighty people without the help of any humans \f + \ft synecdoche \f*.
\b
\q
\v 21 He sees \f + \ft metonymy \f* everything that people do; 
\q2 \add when we walk\add*, he watches every step that we take. 
\q
\v 22 There is no gloom or darkness \f + \ft doublet \f* that is very dark, 
\q2 with the result that sinners can hide \add from God\add* in that darkness.
\q
\v 23 God does not \add need to\add* set a time 
\q2 when we will stand in front of him in order that he may judge us.
\q2 \add He can judge us whenever he wants to\add*. 
\q
\v 24 He destroys mighty people without \add needing to\add* investigate
\add what they have done\add*, 
\q2 and he appoints others to take their places. 
\q
\v 25 Because he already knows what they have done, 
\q2 he removes them at night and gets rid of them. 
\q
\v 26 Where many people can see it, 
\q2 he strikes\f + \ft Or: punishes \f* them because of the wicked things that they have done;
\q
\v 27 he strikes them because they turned away from doing what he wanted them to do
\q2 and did not pay attention to any of his commands. 
\q
\v 28 They \add mistreated\add* the poor people, 
\q2 with the result that those poor people cried out to God \add for
help\add*, 
\q2 and he heard those afflicted people when they cried out \add to
him\add*. 
\q
\v 29 But if God decides to do nothing \add to punish wicked people\add*,
\q2 no one can criticize\f + \ft Or: condemn \f* him. 
\q If a godless\f + \ft Or: wicked \f* man rules a nation, 
\q2 a man who tricks\f + \ft Or: deceives \f* the people, 
\q
\v 30 and if \add God\add* hides his face \add with the result that he does not see and punish that
ruler\add*, 
\q2 no one will be able to prevent that ruler \add doing those things\add*.
\b
\q
\v 31 Job, have you or anyone else ever said to God, 'I have been punished
\add for my sins\add*, 
\q2 and I will not sin anymore; 
\q
\v 32 so teach\f + \ft Or: show \f* me what \add sins I have committed\add*; 
\q if I have done anything that is evil, 
\q2 I will not do it anymore.'? 
\q
\v 33  \add Job\add*, you object to what God has done to you, 
\q2 but do you think that he will do what you want him to do? 
\q It is you who must choose \add what you say to God\add*, not I;
\q2 so tell me what you are thinking about this. 
\b
\q
\v 34 People who have good sense, those who are wise and who listen to what I say,
\q2 will say to me, 
\q
\v 35 'Job is speaking ignorantly; 
\q2 what he says is nonsense.' 
\q
\v 36 I think that Job should be taken to a court and put on trial\f + \ft Or: judged \f* thoroughly,
\q2 because he answers \add us his friends\add* like wicked men would answer.
\q
\v 37 To add to the \add other\add* sins that he has committed, he is rebelling
\add against God\add*; 
\q2 he shows us that he does not respect God [IDI], 
\q2 making long speeches \add saying that God has punished him unjustly\add*."
