\s Elihu continued his final speech 
\q
\v 1 “My heart thumps wildly \f + \fr doublet \f* when \add I think about\add* that.
\q
\v 2 Listen, all of you, to the thunder, 
\q2 which is like God's voice \f + \fr doublet \f*. 
\q
\v 3 He sends thunder all across the sky, 
\q2 and he sends lighting to the most distant places on the earth.
\q
\v 4 After \add the lightning flashes\add*, we hear the thunder 
\q2 which is like \f + \fr metaphor \f* God's majestic voice; 
\q2 he does not restrain the lightning when he speaks. 
\q
\v 5 When God speaks, it is awesome, like thunder; 
\q2 he does amazing things which we cannot \add fully\add* understand.
\q
\v 6 He commands the snow to fall on the ground, 
\q2 and \add sometimes\add* he causes it to rain very hard. 
\q
\v 7 And \add when God does that\add*, it prevents people \f + \fr synecdoche \f* from working,
\q2 in order that all people may know that he is the one who has done that (OR, what he can do).
\q
\v 8  \add When it rains\add*, the animals go into their hiding places,
\q2 and they remain there \add until the rain stops\add*. 
\q
\v 9 The storms/hurricanes come from the place \add in the south where they
start\add*, 
\q2 and the cold wind comes from the north. 
\q
\v 10  \add In the ◄winter/cold season►, the cold north wind is like\add* God's breath that causes \f + \fr metaphor \f* water to freeze
\q2 and the lakes/streams to become ice. 
\q
\v 11 God fills the clouds with moisture/hail, 
\q2 and lightning flashes from the clouds. 
\q
\v 12 He guides the clouds and causes them to move back and forth
\q2 in order that they may accomplish all that he commands them to do, all over the world.
\q
\v 13 Sometimes God sends rain to punish us, 
\q2 and sometimes he sends rain to show us that he acts kindly toward us.
\b
\q
\v 14 Job, listen to this; 
\q2 stop and think about the wonderful things that God does. 
\q
\v 15 ◄Do you know how God commands the lightning to flash down from his clouds?/We do not know how God commands the lightning
to flash down from his clouds.► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* 
\q
\v 16 Only God knows everything perfectly; 
\q2 so ◄do you know how he causes the clouds to ‘move/float’ ‘amazingly/wonderfully’ across the sky?/you certainly do not know
how he causes the clouds to ‘move/float’ ‘amazingly/wonderfully’ across the sky!► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*
\q
\v 17 No, you just sweat there in your clothes; 
\q2 \add it is very oppressive\add* when the \add hot\add* wind stops blowing from the south and
\add all the leaves on the trees\add* ◄become still/do not move►.
\q
\v 18 ◄Can you stretch out the skies like God does and make them as hard as \f + \fr simile \f* a sheet of polished brass?/You certainly
cannot stretch out the skies like God does and make them as hard as \f + \fr simile \f* a sheet of polished brass!► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*
\b
\q
\v 19 Job, tell us(exc) what we should say to God; 
\q2 we do not know anything [IDI]. 
\q2 As a result, we do not know what to say to him to defend ourselves.
\q
\v 20 Should I tell God that I want to speak to him? 
\q2 No, because \add if I did that\add*, he might destroy me. 
\q
\v 21 Now, people cannot look \add directly\add* at the sun 
\q2 when it shines brightly in the sky after the wind has blown the clouds away;
\q2 \add so, we certainly cannot look at the brightness of God\add*.
\q
\v 22 God comes out of the north with a light \add that shines like\add* gold;
\q2 his glory causes us to be afraid. 
\q
\v 23 Almighty God has very great power, 
\q2 and we cannot come near to him. 
\q He always acts righteously, 
\q2 and he will never oppress us. 
\q
\v 24 That is the reason that we have an awesome respect for him;
\q2 he does not pay attention to those who proudly, \add but wrongly\add*, think that they are wise.”
