\c 1  
\s Job and his family 
\p
\v 1 In the land named Uz, there was a man named Job. He was a very godly\f + \ft Or: righteous \f* \f + \ft doublet \f* man, who greatly respected\f + \ft Or: revered \f*
God and always avoided doing evil things. 
\v 2 He had seven sons and three daughters. 
\v 3 He owned 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 1,000 oxen, and 500 female donkeys. He also had many servants. He was the richest man
in all the area east \add of the Jordan River\add*. 
\p
\v 4 Each year, Job's sons made feasts \add in their houses\add* to celebrate their birthdays. Whenever each one made a feast,
he would invite \add all his brothers\add* and his three sisters to come and eat together.
\v 5 When each celebration ended, Job would summon them. He would get up early in the morning and kill animals and burn them on
the altar as sacrifices, one for each of his children. He said to himself, "Perhaps
\add one of\add* my sons has sinned and said something evil about God in his heart."
\s Satan wanted to test Job 
\p
\v 6 One day, the angels came and gathered together in front of Yahweh, and Satan came too.
\v 7 Yahweh asked Satan, "Where have you come from?" 
\p Satan replied, "I have come from the earth, where I been traveling back and forth, seeing what is happening."
\p
\v 8 Yahweh said to Satan, "Have you noticed\f + \ft Or: thought about \f* my \add faithful\add* servant Job? He is very godly, Or: righteous
\f + \ft doublet \f*, he greatly respects\f + \ft Or: reveres \f* me, and he always avoids doing evil things. There is no one else on the earth like him."
\v 9 Satan replied to Yahweh, "\add What you say is true\add*, but Job greatly respects you
\add only\add* because of what \add you have done for him\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*.
\v 10 You have always \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* protected \f + \ft metaphor \f* him and his family and everything that he owns. You have made him very
prosperous\f + \ft Or: rich \f*. He has very many livestock all over this land. 
\v 11 But if you take away \f + \ft metonymy \f* everything that he has, he will curse you openly. [IDI]"
\p
\v 12 Yahweh replied to Satan, "All right\f + \ft Or: Okay \f*, I will permit you to take away everything that he has. But do not harm him."
\p Then Satan left, \add and he prepared to cause many disastrous things to happen to
Job\add*. 
\p
\v 13 One day \add after that\add*, Job's sons and daughters were feasting and drinking wine at the home of their oldest
brother. 
\v 14 While they were doing that, a messenger arrived at Job's home and said to him, "While your oxen were plowing
\add the fields\add* and the donkeys were grazing nearby, 
\v 15 a group of men from the Sheba \add area\add* came and attacked us. They killed all your servants
\add who were working in the fields\add* and took away all the oxen and donkeys! I am the only one who escaped to
\add come and\add* tell you what happened." 
\p
\v 16 While he was still talking to Job, another messenger arrived. He said to Job, "Lightning from the sky \f + \ft metonymy \f* struck and
killed all the sheep and all the men who were taking care of the sheep! I am the only one who escaped to
\add come and\add* tell you \add what happened\add*." 
\p
\v 17 While he was still talking to Job, another messenger arrived. He said to Job, "Three groups of
\add robbers\f + \ft Or: bandits \f*\add* from Chaldea \add land\add* came and attacked us. They stole all the camels and killed all the men
who were taking care of them. I am the only one who escaped to \add come
and\add* tell you \add what happened\add*." 
\p
\v 18 While he was still talking to Job, another messenger arrived and reported this to Job: "Your sons and daughters were
feasting in the home of their oldest brother. 
\v 19 Suddenly a very strong wind\f + \ft Or: tornado \f* came from the desert and struck the house. The house collapsed on your sons and
daughters and killed them all! I am the only one who escaped to \add come
and\add* tell you \add what happened\add*." 
\p
\v 20 Job stood up, and tore his robe and shaved his head \add because he was very
sad\f + \ft Or: grieved \f*\add*. Then he prostrated himself on the ground \add to worship
God\add*. 
\v 21 He said, 
\q "When I was born, I had no clothes. 
\q When I die, I will not take any clothes with me. 
\q Yahweh gave me \add everything that I possessed\add*, 
\q and \add now\add* he has taken it all away. 
\q But we should\f + \ft Or: I will \f* always praise Yahweh! \f + \ft metonymy \f*" 
\p
\v 22 In spite of all these \add things that happened to Job\add*, he did not sin by saying that what God had done was wrong.
