\s Bildad's second reply

\v 1 Then Bildad replied again: 
\q
\v 2 “When are you going to stop talking \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*? 
\q2 If you would stop talking and listen, we could tell you something.
\q
\v 3 Why do you think that we are as stupid as cattle? [DOU, RHQ]
\q
\v 4 By being very angry, you are only hurting yourself. 
\q2 Do you think that everyone on the earth must leave to prove that you
\add are right\add*, 
\q2 or do you think that God must move the rocks in the mountains
\add to please you\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*? 
\b
\q
\v 5 What will happen is that the lives of wicked people \add like
you\add* end 
\q2 \add as quickly as we can\add* put out a light or extinguish the flame of a fire.
\q
\v 6 And when the lamps above them \add in their tents\add* are extinguished,
\q2 there will be no light in those tents. 
\q
\v 7  \add While they were alive\add* they walked confidently, 
\q2 but later \add it was as though\add* they stumbled and fell,
\q \add because they themselves did not heed\add* the advice \add that they gave to
others\add*. 
\q
\v 8  \add It was as though\add* they walked into their own net 
\q2 or fell into a pit that they themselves have dug. 
\q
\v 9  \add It was as though\add* a trap grabbed their heels and held them fast \f + \ft doublet \f*,
\q
\v 10  \add as though the noose of\add* a rope that was hidden on the ground,
\add whose other end was fastened to the limb of a tree\add*, 
\q2 sprung up and seized them when they walked on it. 
\q
\v 11 Everywhere they went, there were things that caused them to be terrified;
\q2 \add it was as though\add* they were pursuing them and biting at their heels.
\q
\v 12 They became hungry, with the result that they had no strength.
\q2 They experienced disasters \f + \ft personification \f* constantly. 
\q
\v 13 Diseases spread all over their skin\f + \ft Or: bodies \f*; 
\q2 diseases that caused their bodies to decay\f + \ft Or: destroyed their arms and legs \f*.
\q
\v 14  \add When they died\add*, they were snatched away from their tents
\q2 and brought to the one who rules over the dead. 
\q
\v 15 Now other people live in their tents\f + \ft Or: houses \f*, 
\q2 but only after they sprinkle sulfur on those tents\f + \ft Or: houses \f* \add to ◄disinfect them\f + \ft Or: get \f* rid of the
diseases►\add*! 
\q
\v 16  \add Because those who died had no descendants\add*, 
\q2 they were like trees whose roots have dried up and whose branches have all withered \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\q
\v 17 No one on the earth remembers them anymore; 
\q2 no \add one on any\add* street \add even remembers\add* their names \f + \ft metonymy \f*.
\q
\v 18 They were expelled from the earth where there is light, 
\q2 and they were sent into the place where it is dark. 
\q
\v 19 They have no children or grandchildren, 
\q2 no descendants where they previously lived. 
\q
\v 20 People from the east to the west \add who hear about what happened to them,
everyone\add*, 
\q2 are shocked and horrified. 
\q
\v 21 And that is what happens to ungodly\f + \ft Or: sinful \f* people \add like
you\add*, 
\q2 to people who have no interest in\f + \ft Or: have rejected \f* God.”
