\v 1  \add You(sg) know me as\add* the \add chief\add* Elder. \add I am writing this letter to
you\add*, my dear friend Gaius, whom I truly love. 
\v 2 Dear friend, I ask \add God that things may go\add* well for you in every way,
\add specifically\add*, that you will be physically healthy just like you are spiritually healthy \f + \fr metonymy \f*.
\v 3 I am very happy because some fellow believers have come \add here\add* and told me that you conduct your life in
accordance with the true message. You are \add conducting your life\add* in a manner
\add that is consistent with God's\add* true message. 
\v 4 I am very happy when I hear that ◄people whom I helped to believe in Christ/my
\add spiritual\add* children► are conducting their lives like you are!
\s 3 John 5-6 
\s Continue receiving the visiting fellow believers, as you have been doing.
\p
\v 5 Dear friend, you are \add serving Jesus\add* loyally/faithfully whenever you do things to help fellow believers,
\add even those whom you\add* do not know, who are traveling \add around doing God's
work\add*. 
\v 6  \add Some of\add* them have reported before the congregation
\add here how\add* you have showed that you love them. You should continue to help such people in their travels in a way that
is pleasing to God. 
\s 3 John 7-8 
\s Especially provide for them financially. 
\p
\v 7 When those fellow believers went out \add to tell people about
Jesus\add* \f + \fr metonymy \f*, the people who do not believe in Christ did not give them
anything\add to help them\add*. 
\v 8 So we \add who believe in Christ\add* ought to give food and money to such people to help
\add them as they teach others God's\add* true message. 
\s 3 John 9-10 
\s Because Diotrephes does not recognize my authority, I will publicly expose what he does in opposing us.
\p
\v 9 I wrote \add a letter\add* to the congregation \add telling them to help those fellow
believers\add*. However, Diotrephes does not ◄acknowledge my authority/\add pay any attention to
what\add* I wrote►, because he ◄desires to be in charge/wants to be the leader► of
\add the congregation\add*. 
\v 10 So, when I arrive \add there\add* I will \add publicly\add* tell what he does: He tells others evil nonsense about us
\add in order to\add* harm \add us by what he\add* says, and he is not content with only doing that. He himself refuses to
receive the fellow believers who are traveling around doing God's work, and he also stops those who want to receive them by
expelling them from the congregation. 
\s 3 John 11 
\s Do not imitate a bad example; imitate good ones. 
\p
\v 11 Dear friend, do not imitate a bad \add example like that\add*. Instead,
\add keep imitating\add* good \add examples. Remember that\add* people who do good deeds
◄\add truly\add* belong to God/are \add spiritual children\add* of God►,
\add but\add* those who do \add what is\add* evil do not ◄know/have fellowship with► God.
\s 3 John 12 
\s You will do well to receive Demetrius, who is highly recommended.
\p
\v 12 All \add the believers who know Demetrius\add* say that he
\add is a good person\add*. The fact \add that he conducts his life in a way that
is\add* \add consistent/in accordance with God's\add* true \add message\add* shows
\add that he is a good person\add*, and we also say the same thing
\add about him\add*. You know that what we say \add about him\add* is true.
\add So it will be good if you welcome him and help him. He is the one who will be bringing this letter to
you\add*. 
\s 3 John 13-15 
\s Instead of writing more, I expect to visit you soon, and we will speak directly with one another. Our mutual friends here
send their greetings to all of you. 
\p
\v 13  \add When I began\add* to write this letter, I had much more
\add that I intended\add* to tell you. But \add now\add* I do not want to say
\add it\add* in a letter \f + \fr metonymy \f*. 
\v 14 Instead, I expect to \add come and\add* see you soon. Then we will talk directly with one another.
\v 15  \add I pray that God will enable\add* you \add to experience
inner\add* peace. Our friends \add here\add* ◄send you their greetings/say that they are thinking affectionately about you►
\f + \fr metonymy \f*. Tell our friends \add there\add* that we ◄send our greetings to/are thinking fondly about► them.
