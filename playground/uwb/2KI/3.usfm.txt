\s The war between Israel and Moab 
\p
\v 1 After Jehoshaphat had been ruling Judah for almost eighteen years, Ahab's son Joram became the king of Israel. He ruled in
Samaria \add city\add* for twelve years. 
\v 2 He did things that Yahweh said were evil, but he did not do as much evil as his father and mother had done, and he got rid
of the pillar \add for worshiping\add* Baal which his father had made.
\v 3 But he committed the sins that \add King\add* Jeroboam had committed and which induced the Israeli people to sin, and he
did not stop committing those sins. 
\p
\v 4 Mesha, the king of Moab, raised sheep. \add Every year\add* he was forced to give 100,000 lambs and the wool from 100,000
rams to the king of Israel, \add because his kingdom was controlled by the king of
Israel\add*. 
\v 5 But after King Ahab died, Mesha rebelled against the king of Israel.
\v 6 So King Joram left Samaria and gathered together all his soldiers.
\v 7 Then he sent this message to Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah: “The king of Moab has rebelled against me. So will your army
join my army and fight against the army of Moab?” 
\p Jehoshaphat replied, “Yes, we will help you. We are ready to do whatever you want us to. My soldiers and my horses are ready
to help you.” 
\p
\v 8 He asked, “On which road shall we march to attack them?” 
\p Joram replied, “We will go \add south to Jerusalem, where your army will join us. Then we will all go south of the Dead Sea,
and then turn north\add* through the Edom desert.” 
\p
\v 9 So the king of Israel \add and his army\add* went with the kings of Judah and Edom
\add and their armies\add*. They marched for seven days. Then there was no water left for their soldiers or for their animals
that carried supplies. 
\p
\v 10 The king of Israel exclaimed, “This is a terrible situation!
\add It seems that\add* Yahweh will allow the three of us to be captured by
\add the army of\add* [MTY] Moab!” 
\p
\v 11 Jehoshaphat said, “Is there a prophet here who can ask Yahweh for us
\add what we should do\add*?” 
\p One of Joram's army officers said, “Elisha, the son of Shaphat, is here. He was Elijah's assistant.” [IDI]
\p
\v 12 Jehoshaphat said, “\add It will be good to ask him, because\add* he speaks what Yahweh tells him to say.”
\p So those three kings went to Elisha. 
\v 13 Elisha said to the king of Israel, “Why do you come to me [RHQ]? Go and ask those prophets that your father and mother
consulted!” 
\p But Joram replied, “No, \add we want you to ask Yahweh, because it seems
that\add* Yahweh is going to allow us three kings to be captured by the army of Moab.”
\p
\v 14 Elisha replied, “I serve Yahweh, the commander of the armies of angels in heaven. As surely as he lives, if I did not
respect Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not even think about doing anything to help you.
\v 15 But, bring a musician to me.” 
\p \add So they did that\add*. And when the musician played \add on his
harp\add*, the power of Yahweh came on Elisha. 
\v 16 He said, “Yahweh says that he will cause this dry stream-bed to be full of water.
\v 17 The result will be that your soldiers and your animals that carry supplies and your livestock will have plenty of water
to drink. 
\v 18 That is not difficult for Yahweh to do. \add But He will do more than
that\add*. He will also enable you to defeat \add the army of\add* Moab.
\v 19 You will conquer all their beautiful cities, cities that have high walls around them. You must cut down all their fruit
trees, stop water from flowing from their springs, and ruin their fertile fields by covering them with rocks.”
\p
\v 20 The next morning, at the time when they offered the sacrifices
\add of grain\add*, they were surprised to see water flowing from Edom and covering the ground.
\p
\v 21 When the people of Moab heard that the three kings had come
\add with their armies\add* to fight against them, all the men who were able to fight in battles, from the youngest men to the
oldest ones, were summoned, and they ◄took their positions/prepared to fight► at the
\add southern\add* border of their land. 
\v 22 But when they rose early the next morning, they saw that the water across from them appeared to be as red as blood.
\v 23 They exclaimed, “It is blood! The three enemy armies must have fought and killed each other! So let's go and take
everything that they have left!” 
\p
\v 24 But when they reached the area where the Israeli soldiers had set up their tents, the Israelis attacked the soldiers from
Moab and forced them to retreat. The Israeli soldiers pursued the soldiers from Moab and killed many of them.
\v 25 The Israelis also destroyed their cities. And whenever they passed fertile fields, they threw rocks on those fields,
until the fields were covered with rocks. They stopped water from flowing from the springs and cut down the fruit trees.
Finally, only \add the capital city\add*, Kir-Hareseth, remained. The Israeli soldiers who threw stones with slings surrounded
the city and attacked it. 
\v 26 When the king of Moab realized that his army was being defeated, he took with him seven hundred men who fought with
swords, and they tried to force a way through the Israeli lines of soldiers to escape to
\add get help from\add* the king of Syria, but they were unable to escape.
\v 27 Then the king of Moab took his oldest son, who would have become the next king, and killed him and offered him for a
sacrifice \add to their god Chemosh\add*, burning him on top of the city wall. The Israeli soldiers were horrified, with the
result that they left that city and returned to their own country.
