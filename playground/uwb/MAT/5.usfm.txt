\c 5  
\s Matthew 5:1-12 
\s On a hillside, Jesus taught his disciples and others what kind of people God esteems.
\p
\v 1 When Jesus saw the crowds, he went up on a hillside. He sat down
\add in order to teach\add* his disciples. They came near to him
\add to listen to him\add*. 
\v 2 Then he began to teach them by saying, 
\q
\v 3  \add God\add* is pleased with people who recognize that they have a spiritual
\add need\add*; 
\q he will allow them to be the people whose lives he rules over.
\q
\v 4  \add God\add* is pleased with people who mourn \add because they have
sinned;\add* 
\q they will be encouraged {he will encourage them.} 
\q
\v 5  \add God\add* is pleased with people who are meek; 
\q they will inherit the earth \add that God will recreate\add*.
\q
\v 6  \add God\add* is pleased with people who sincerely \add desire to
live\add* righteously \add just like they\add* desire to eat and drink [MET];
\q they will be enabled {he will enable them} to do all that he desires [MET].
\q
\v 7  \add God\add* is pleased with people who act mercifully; 
\q he will act mercifully to them. 
\q
\v 8  \add God\add* is pleased with people who think only about that which pleases him;
\q \add some day\add* they will \add be where\add* God is and will see him.
\q
\v 9  \add God\add* is pleased with people who help other people to live peacefully;
\q they will be considered to be {he will consider that they are} his children [MET].
\q
\v 10  \add God is pleased with\add* people to whom evil things are done {to whom
\add other people\add* do evil things} because they \add conducted
themselves\add* righteously; 
\q he will allow them to be where he rules over people. 
\q
\v 11  \add God is pleased with\add* you when \add other\add* people insult you, when
\add other people\add* do evil things to you and when \add other
people\add* say falsely \add that\add* you are evil because \add you believe
in\add* me. 
\v 12  \add When that happens\add*, rejoice and be glad [DOU], because
\add God will give\add* you a great reward in heaven. \add God will think highly of
you\add*, just like \add he thought highly of\add* the prophets whom your
\add ancestors persecuted\add* long ago. 
\s Matthew 5:13-16 
\s Jesus taught that we should live in such a way that other people will see how we live and will praise God.
\p
\v 13 “\bd You\bd* are \add able to influence\add* evil \add people\add* [MTY]
\add and improve the way they live in order that they do not become more evil, just
like\add* salt \add is able to improve the flavor of food and to preserve
it\add* [MET] \add from spoiling\add*. Salt that no longer tastes salty cannot become salty again [RHQ]. As a result, that salt
becomes useless. It is rejected by people, thrown on the ground, and walked on {People reject it, throw it on the ground and
walk on it} [MET]. \add Similarly, if the way you live no longer influences people to live in a godly manner, God will reject
you\add*. 
\v 14  \bd You\bd* \add enable\add* evil \add people\add* [MTY] \add to perceive God's truth
as\add* a light \add enables people to perceive what is around them. Just
like\add* everyone can see [LIT] \add the lights of\add* a city on a hill [MET],
\add other people can see what you do\add*. 
\v 15 After people light a lamp, they never put it under a basket. Instead,
\add they put it\add* on a lampstand in their houses in order that it can shine on everyone there.
\v 16  \add Similarly\add*, you need to do \add what is right\add* [MET] in such a manner that other people can see the good
deeds that you do, and as a result they will praise your Father \add who
is\add* in heaven.” 
\s Matthew 5:17-20 
\s Jesus taught that it is important to obey all of God's commandments.
\p
\v 17 “I came to earth, not to annul the laws \add that God gave
Moses\add* or \add what\add* the prophets [MTY] \add wrote\add*. Instead, I
\add came\add* to cause to happen \add what the authors of those books predicted would
happen\add*. So do not think any longer that I have come \add to
earth\add* in order that I might annul \add what they wrote\add*.
\v 18 Keep this in mind: \add Every\add* point of those laws, \add including those points that
seem\add* least important, and even the smallest details of the laws [MTY] will surely be in effect [HYP, LIT] until the
heavens and the earth disappear and until all \add that God told their authors to
write\add* happens. 
\v 19 Since \add all God's laws are important\add*, if anyone disobeys any of those commandments,
\add even if it would be\add* one of the least \add important ones\add*, and if that person teaches people
\add to disobey any of those commandments\add*, it will be said {\add God\add* will say} that that person is the least
\add important\add* of those in the place where [EUP] God rules. But those who obey
\add those commandments\add* and teach \add other people to obey them, it will be
said\add* {\add God\add* will say} that they are very important among those that God rules.
\v 20 Keep this in mind: \add You assume that\add* the Pharisees and the men who teach our laws
\add faithfully obey\add* what God commands. But if you do not obey those laws better than they obey them, you will by no means
enter the place where God [EUP] rules.” 
\s Matthew 5:11-26 
\s Jesus taught that we should not be angry and that we should quickly settle accounts with those whom we have wronged.
\p
\v 21 “You have heard \add your religious teachers say\add* that it was said {that
\add Moses\add* said} to your ancestors, ‘Do not murder \add anyone.’ This implied
that\add* if someone murders \add another person\add*, the judge will condemn that person
\add and\add* sentence him to be\add executed\add* {\add say that someone must execute
him\add*}. 
\v 22 But what I say to you is this: \add If you are\add* angry with someone,
\add God\add* will judge you. If you say to someone, ‘\add You are
worthless\add*,’ the Jewish Council will judge you. If you say \add to
someone\add*, ‘\add You are\add* a fool,’ \add God will throw you\add* into the fires in hell.
\v 23 So, when you take your gift \add for God\add* to the altar, if you remember that you have offended someone,
\v 24 leave your gift by the altar, and first go \add to the person you have
offended\add*. Tell that person that you are sorry for what you have done, and ask that person to forgive you. Then go back and
offer your gift\add to God\add*. 
\v 25  \add Also\add*, when a fellow citizen \add takes you to court in order
to\add* accuse you, settle accounts with that person quickly while you are walking with that person on the road. Do that
\add while there still is time to do so\add* in order that he will not take you to the
judge\add , because if\add* the judge \add favors the person who is accusing you, he will declare that you are guilty and send
you\add* to the prison guard, and the prison guard will put you in prison.
\v 26 Keep this in mind: \add If you go to prison\add*, you will never get out
\add because you will never be able to\add* pay all that the judge says that you owe [MET].
\add And remember also that\add* you \add ought to settle accounts with God before you die,
too\add*.” 
\s Matthew 5:27-30 
\s Jesus taught about the way to refuse to sin when we are tempted to do something wrong.
\p
\v 27 “You have heard \add God's\add* commandment, ‘Do not commit adultery.’
\v 28 But what I say to you is this: If a man only looks at a woman desiring to have sex with her,
\add God considers that\add* his thinking about sinning sexually [MET] is sin.
\v 29 If because of what you see [MTY] you \add are tempted to\add* sin,
\add stop looking at those things! Even if you have to\add* gouge out one of your eyes and throw it away [HYP]
\add to avoid sinning, do it!\add* It is good \add that you not sin
and\add* as a result \add go to heaven, even though while you are still here on
earth\add* you lack one \add or both of\add* your eyes. But it is not good
\add that you continue to have two eyes and sin and, as a result,
God\add* sends your whole body to hell. 
\v 30 If you are \add tempted to\add* use one of your hands to sin [MTY],
\add stop using your hand. Even if you have to\add* cut your hand off and throw it
away\add to avoid sinning, do it\add* [HYP]! It is good \add that you do not sin and as a result you go to heaven, even though
while you are still here on earth\add* you lack one \add or both\add* of your
\add hands\add*. But it is not good \add that you sin and, as a result,
God\add* sends your whole body to hell.” 
\s Matthew 5:31-32 
\s Jesus taught that people should not divorce their spouses. 
\p
\v 31 “It is written {\add Moses\add* wrote}, ‘If a man is divorcing his wife, he should write a document
\add on which he states that he is\add* divorcing her.’ 
\v 32 But \add now listen to what\add* I say to you: \add A man\add* may
\add divorce his wife\add* only if she has committed adultery, \add and not for any other
reason\add*. If a man divorces his wife \add for any other reason, and he has sex with another
woman\add*, he makes his wife become one against whom he has committed adultery,
\add because in God's estimation she still is his wife\add*. Also, if a man marries a woman who is divorced {whose husband has
divorced her}, \add God considers\add* him\add guilty of\add* committing adultery.”
\s Matthew 5:33-37 
\s Jesus taught that people should not add anything to make their words more credible when they promise to do something.
\p
\v 33 “You have also heard \add your religious teachers say\add* that it was written {that
\add Moses\add* wrote} to your ancestors, ‘Make sure that you do what you promised the Lord that you would do!’ [DOU]
\v 34 But \add now listen to what\add* I say to you: Never promise to do anything and then ask a superior being to
affirm\add that what you are saying will happen. For example, do\add* not
\add promise that you will give something and then ask spiritual beings
in\add* heaven [MTY] \add to affirm that you will do it\add*, because heaven is where God
\add sits\add* on his throne [MTY] \add to rule over people\add*.
\v 35  \add Also, do\add* not \add promise that you will give something and then ask spiritual
beings\add* on earth [MTY] \add to affirm that you will do it\add*, because the earth is where God rests his feet [MET].
\add Also, do\add* not \add promise that you will do something and ask religious
authorities\add* in Jerusalem \add to affirm that you will do it\add*, because Jerusalem is the city where
\add God\add*, the great King \add rules\add*. 
\p
\v 36  \add Also, do not promise that you will do something and then say
that\add* your head \add should be cut off\add* {\add someone should cut
off\add* your head} \add if you do not do it\add*. You are not \add even\add* able to
\add change the color of the hair of your head by\add* making one
\add black\add* hair white or one \add white\add* hair black. 
\v 37  \add If you talk about doing something\add*, just say ‘Yes, I
\add will do it\add*,’ or ‘No, I \add will not do it\add*.’ \add If you
say\add* anything more than that, it is from \add Satan\add*, the Evil One.”
\s Matthew 5:38-42 
\s Jesus taught that everyone should be kind to all people, even to people who mistreat us.
\p
\v 38 “You have heard \add your religious teachers say\add* that
\add it is written\add* {\add Moses wrote\add*}, ‘\add Retaliate like
this\add*: \add If someone damages\add* one of your eyes, \add someone should
damage\add* one of that person's eyes. \add If someone damages\add* one of your teeth,
\add someone should damage\add* one of that person's teeth.’ 
\v 39 But \add now listen to what\add* I say to you: Do not take revenge for evil
\add deeds done\add* {\add that other people do\add*} \add to you\add*. Instead, if someone
\add insults you by\add* striking you on one cheek, turn your other cheek toward that person
\add in order that he can strike it also\add*. 
\v 40 If someone wants to sue you and take your ◄inner garment/shirt►, give him your ◄outer garment/coat► also.
\v 41 If a \add military authority\add* compels you to go with him one mile
\add and carry his gear\add*, go with him two miles \add and carry his
gear\add*. 
\v 42 Also, if someone asks you for \add something\add*, give \add him what he is asking
for\add*. If someone requests you to lend him \add something\add*, do not refuse
\add to lend it to him\add*.” 
\s Matthew 5:43-48 
\s Jesus taught that we should love the people whom we would not normally love.
\p
\v 43 “You have heard \add your religious teachers say that it is
written\add* {\add that Moses wrote\add*}, ‘Love the citizens of your country and hate your enemies.’
\v 44 But \add now listen to what\add* I say to you: Love your enemies
\add as well as your friends\add*, and pray for those who cause you to suffer.
\v 45 Do that in order to imitate what\add God\add*, your Father
\add who is\add* in heaven, does. He desires that you [MET] do \add like he
does\add*. \add He acts kindly to all people. For example, he causes\add* the sun to shine
\add equally\add* on wicked \add people\add* and on good \add people\add*, and
\add he sends\add* rain \add both\add* on righteous \add people\add* and on unrighteous
\add people\add*. 
\v 46 If you love \add only\add* the people who love you, ◄\add do not expect God
to\add* reward you \add in heaven\add*!/will \add God\add* reward you
\add in heaven\add*?► [RHQ] \add This is based on the fact that everyone\add*, even the tax collectors,
\add who you think are very great sinners\add*, love [RHQ] those who love them.
\add If you act like them\add*, ◄\add you are not any different from tax collectors!/in what way are you different from tax
collectors\add*?► [RHQ] 
\v 47 If you want \add God\add* to bless only your friends, ◄you are not acting any better than other people!/are you acting
any better than other people?► [RHQ] Even the non-Jews, \add who you think sin very
much\add* (OR, \add you think are unacceptable to God\add*), want God to bless their friends [RHQ],
\add but God does not reward them for that\add*. 
\v 48  \add You need to love those who do not love you\add*, and in that way become perfect as
\add God\add* your Father, \add who is\add* in heaven, is perfect.”
