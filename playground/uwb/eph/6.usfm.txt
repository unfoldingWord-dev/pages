\c 6  
\p
\v 1 You children, because you ◄belong to/have a close relationship with► the Lord
\add Jesus\add*, obey your parents, because it is right \add for you to
do\add* that. 
\v 2 God commanded \add in the Scriptures\add*, 
\p \add Greatly\add* respect your father and mother. 
\q That is the first law \add that God\add* commanded in \add which he
also\add* promised \add something\add*. \add He promised\add*, 
\p
\v 3  \add If you do\add* that, you will prosper, and you will live a long time on the earth.
\p
\v 4 You parents (OR, You fathers), do not treat your children so severely that they become angry. Instead, bring them up well
by instructing them and by disciplining them in \add the manner that\add* the Lord
\add Jesus wants you to do\add*. 
\p
\v 5 You slaves, obey those who are \add your masters\add* here on the earth. Obey them very respectfully and sincerely \f + \fr doublet \f*,
just like you obey Christ. 
\v 6 Obey them, not only when they are watching \f + \fr metonymy \f* you, and not only to cause them to think highly/well of you. Instead,
obey them as \add though you were\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f* slaves of Christ, \add not slaves of your
masters\add*. Do enthusiastically what God wants \add you to do\add*.
\v 7 Serve \add your masters\add* zealously/wholeheartedly, as you would serve the Lord
\add Jesus\add*, not as you would serve \add ordinary\add* people.
\v 8  \add Do this because\add* you know that \add some day\add* the Lord Jesus will reward each person for whatever good
\add deeds\add* that person has done. He will reward people who are slaves and people who are not slaves.
\p
\v 9 You masters, just like your slaves \add should serve you well\add*, you similarly must treat them well. Stop threatening
\add to beat\add* them \add if they do not do their work well\add*. Do not forget that the one who is their Lord and your Lord
is in heaven. \add So he is the one who will say to you and your slaves whether he approves of what you and they have
done\add*, and \add when he judges people\add*, he does not act more favorably
\add toward some than he acts toward others\add*. 
\s Ephesians 6:10-20 
\s As you always rely on the Lord to strengthen you, make use of every spiritual resource that God provides to resist the devil
and all his powerful evil spirits. 
\p
\v 10 Finally, at all times rely/depend completely on the Lord \add Jesus\add* to strengthen you
\add spiritually\add* by his own mighty power. 
\v 11  \add Just like a soldier\add* puts on all his ◄armor/things
\add to help him fight\add*► \f + \fr metaphor \f*, you should \add use every spiritual resource/help that God provides for
you\add*, in order that you may successfully resist the devil when he cleverly tries
\add to oppose you\add*. 
\v 12 You must do this because the fighting that we \add believers\add* do is not only against human beings \f + \fr synecdoche \f*. Instead, we
are also fighting against evil spirits who rule and have authority over all that is evil \f + \fr metaphor \f* in the world. We are fighting
against evil spirits who are in heavenly places (OR, everywhere).
\v 13 Therefore, \add just like a soldier\add* puts on all his ◄armor/things to help him fight► \f + \fr metaphor \f*,
\add use well all the spiritual resources/helps that God provides for
you\add*. Do that in order that you may be able to resist successfully the devil and all his powerful evil spirits \f + \fr metonymy \f* every
time they ◄attack you/tempt you to sin or cause something bad to happen to you►.
\add Do it also in order that\add* when you have done all that you can to resist them
\add when they attack you\add*, you will still be ready to resist them
\add when they attack you the next time\add*. 
\p
\v 14 You must be ready to firmly \add resist the devil and his evil
spirits\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f*, \add just like soldiers must be ready to resist the enemy. Prepare for doing that by doing these
things\add*: \add To be strong spiritually\add*, hold firmly to \add God's\add* truth, just like soldiers prepare ◄to stand
firm against/to firmly resist► their enemies by fastening their belts around their waists \f + \fr metaphor \f*. Act righteously
\add in order to protect yourself against demonic attacks, just like
soldiers\add* put on breastplates \add to protect their chests against his enemies'
attacks\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f*. 
\v 15 Hold firmly the good message\add that gives us\add* peace \add with God, just like
soldiers\add* put on their boots firmly \f + \fr metaphor \f* ◄to stand firm \add against/\add*to firmly
\add resist\add*► \add their enemies\add*. 
\v 16 In addition, keep trusting firmly \add in the Lord. That will enable you to protect yourselves from anything that
Satan\add*, the evil one, \add may do to harm you spiritually, just like
soldiers\add* carry shields \add to protect themselves against\add* the arrows that have flaming tips
\add that their enemies shoot at them\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f*. 
\v 17 And \add rely/depend on the fact that God\add* has saved you,
\add in order to protect yourselves against demonic attacks, just like
soldiers\add* put on a helmet \add to protect\add* their \add heads from attacks
by\add* their \add enemies\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f*. And be ready to use \add the weapon that
God's\add* Spirit \add has given you\add*, which is the message of God,
\add in order to fight against\add* ◄\add demonic powers/Satan\add*►,
\add just like soldiers\add* use their swords \add to fight against their
enemies\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f*. 
\v 18 As you are doing that, keep praying \add to God\add* at all times, and requesting him
\add to do things for you and others;\add* and let God's Spirit \add direct what you
pray\add*. For this purpose, always be \add spiritually\add* alert/watchful, and ◄always be persistent in/never quit► praying
for all God's people. 
\v 19 And \add specifically\add*, pray for me. Pray that God will tell me what I should say \f + \fr metonymy \f* whenever I speak, in order
that I may boldly tell others the good message about Christ. People did not know that message before,
\add but God has now revealed it to me\add*. 
\v 20 I am ◄a representative \add of Christ\add*/one who speaks on behalf
\add of Christ\add*► \add as I tell this message to others, and\add* I am in prison \f + \fr metonymy \f*
\add because of that\add*. Pray that when I tell \add others about
Christ\add*, I may speak without being afraid, because that is how I ought to speak.
\s Ephesians 6:21-24 
\s I am sending Tychicus to tell you what is happening here and to encourage you. I pray that God will give you peace and love
for each other, and that he will continue to act kindly toward you all.
\p
\v 21 In order that you may know about \add what is happening\add* to me and what I am doing, I am sending Tychicus
\add to you with this letter\add*. He will tell you everything \add that is happening
here\add*. He is a fellow believer whom we all \add (inc)\add* love very much, and he serves the Lord
\add Jesus\add* faithfully. 
\v 22 That is the reason that I am sending him \add to you\add*; I want you to know ◄how my companions and I are/what is
happening to my companions and me►, and I want him to encourage you \f + \fr synecdoche \f*.
\p
\v 23  \add I pray that\add* God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ will cause all of you fellow believers to have
\add inner\add* peace, and \add enable you to\add* love \add each
other\add* and to continue trusting \add in Christ\add*. 
\v 24 I pray that God will continue to act kindly to \add you and\add* to all
\add others\add* who love our Lord Jesus Christ and will never quit loving him.
