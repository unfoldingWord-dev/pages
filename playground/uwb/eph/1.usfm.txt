\v 1 I, Paul, am an apostle whom God appointed to represent\f + \ft Or: to proclaim the message about \f* Christ Jesus because that is what
God wanted. \add I am writing this letter\add* to you who are the people of God in Ephesus
\add city. You are people who\add* faithfully\f + \ft Or: continue to \f* trust in Christ Jesus and who have a close relationship with him.
\v 2  \add I pray that\add* God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord will continue to act kindly toward you and cause you to
have \add inner\add* peace. 
\s Ephesians 1:3-14 
\s We should praise God for having chosen and redeemed us, having revealed his plan to unite all things under Christ, and
causing Christ to rule over all his people. 
\p
\v 3 Praise God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! Because of our relationship with Christ, he has blessed us spiritually in
every way by giving us blessings that come from heaven. 
\v 4 Before God created the world, he chose us to be his people because of our relationship with\f + \ft Or: union with \f* Christ, in order
that \add God could consider\add* us to be completely holy \f + \ft doublet \f*. Because
\add God\add* loves \add us\add*, 
\v 5 he decided long ago that he would adopt us to be \add as though we
were\add* his own children because of what Jesus Christ \add has
done\add*. He decided to do that because it pleased him to do that,
\v 6 in order that we would praise him for acting very kindly toward us in a wonderful way that we did not deserve, because of
our relationship with his beloved Son \f + \ft Or:\add Son whom he\add* loves \f*.
\p
\v 7 When the blood of Christ\add flowed when he died\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*,
\add it was as though\add* he paid a price to free\f + \ft Or: save \f* us \add from the guilt of our
sins\add*. \add That\add* \add provided a way\f + \ft Or: made it possible\add* \f*
\add for\add* God to act very kindly toward us to forgive us for having sinned.
\v 8 He acted very kindly toward us and enabled us to become wise about many \f + \ft hyperbole \f* things and to understand his truth.
\v 9 He has enabled us to know the things that he had planned secretly \f + \ft Or: that he had not revealed to anyone yet \f*. He did
that because he wanted to do that, and because he planned to do that by means of the things Christ would do.
\v 10 God planned that at the time that \add he appointed\add*, he would unite all things\f + \ft Or: beings \f* in heaven and all
things\f + \ft Or: beings \f* on earth \f + \ft Or: all beings in heaven and all things on earth \f*, and cause Christ to be the one who will rule them
\f + \ft metaphor \f*. 
\v 11 Because of our close relationship with Christ, God has also chosen
us\add \f + \ft inclusive \f*\add* \f + \ft Or: us\add (exc \f*\add* Jews) to receive what he has promised
\add to give\add* us. He decided long ago to do that. It was exactly what he planned. He accomplishes everything exactly as he
plans and desires, 
\v 12 in order that we\f + \ft exclusive \f* Jews, who confidently expected the Messiah to do great things for us before the non-Jews expected
such things \f + \ft Or: we \add (inc \f*\add* who were already confidently expecting Christ
\add to do great things for us\add*) will praise him for his greatness.
\v 13 You \add Ephesians\add* also heard the true message, the good message about how God saves you.
\add People\add* put their seal on something to show that \add it belongs to
them\add*. Similarly, when you believed \add in Christ\add*, God
\add showed that you also belong to him by sending you\add* the Holy Spirit as he promised to do \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\v 14 The Holy Spirit is \add like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* a deposit\f + \ft Or: down payment \f*. That is, he guarantees\f + \ft Or: assures us \f* that
\add we will receive\add* all that God has promised to give us, at the time when God will give to those who belong to him \f + \ft metaphor \f*
everything that \add Christ\add* freed us to receive. \add God also assures you that you belong to
him\add*, in order that you would praise him for his greatness. 
\s Ephesians 1:15-23 
\s I thank God for your faith, and pray that you will understand more about how powerfully he works on our behalf, just like he
did when he raised Christ from the dead and made him ruler over everything.
\p
\v 15 Because of \add what God has done for you\add*, and because
\add people\add* told me that you continue to trust in the Lord Jesus and that you love all those who belong to God,
\v 16 I thank God for you constantly \f + \ft litotes, hyperbole \f*. I mention\f + \ft Or: pray for \f* you constantly, whenever I pray.
\v 17  \add I pray\add* that God, who is the glorious\f + \ft Or: wonderful \f* Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, may cause his Spirit to make
you wise, and that his Spirit will reveal \add God to you\add* so that you may fully know him.
\v 18 And I pray that God would enable you to understand \f + \ft metonymy \f* his truth within your inner beings\f + \ft Or: hearts \f*, in order that in
your inner beings\f + \ft Or: hearts \f* you may know the things that we believers should confidently expect to receive because he chose us
\add to be his people\add*. And I pray that you will know how God will bless his people in a very wonderful way
\add when we finally receive\add* all that he has promised to give us.
\v 19 And \add I pray that\add* you will know how very powerfully
\add God acts\add* for us who continue to trust \add in Christ\add*. He works powerfully for us
\v 20 just like he acted powerfully for Christ when he caused Christ to become alive again after he died, and put him in the
place of highest\f + \ft Or: greatest \f* honor \f + \ft metonymy \f* in heaven. 
\v 21  \add There\add*, Christ is the supreme ruler over every powerful spirit of every level of authority. His rank is much
higher than any of them can receive, not only now, but forever. 
\v 22 God has caused all beings to be subject to Christ \f + \ft metonymy \f*, and he has also appointed Christ, who rules over all things, to
rule \f + \ft metaphor \f* over all believers. 
\v 23 We believers \add relate to Christ like the parts of a person's\add* body \f + \ft metaphor \f*
\add relate to its head\add*. Christ uses all \add his power among
us\add* just like he uses his power throughout the whole universe.
