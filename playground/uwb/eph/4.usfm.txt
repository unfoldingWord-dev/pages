\c 4  
\s Ephesians 4:1-16 
\s Conduct your lives in a way that shows that you are God's people; do all that you can to keep all the believers united; and
remember that Christ has given various abilities to each of his people, in order that they may be united and grow spiritually
and become like Christ. 
\p
\v 1 Therefore I, who am in prison because \add I serve\add* the Lord
\add Jesus\add*, urge you, whom God has chosen \add to be his people, to do these
things\add*: Conduct your lives as \add God's people\add* should.
\v 2 Always be humble, and do not demand your own rights. Be patient
\add with each other\add*, and, because you love each other, endure each other's
◄\add irritating\add* behavior/behavior that you do not like►. 
\v 3  \add God's\add* Spirit has caused you to be united \add with one
another\add*, so do all that you can to remain united \add with one
another\add* by acting peacefully \add toward each other\add*. 
\v 4  \add All we believers form just one group\add* \f + \fk metaphor \f*, and there is only one
\add Holy\add* Spirit, just like you were chosen {\add God\add* chose you} in order that you all might confidently keep
expecting one\add set of good\add* things as a result of his choosing you.
\v 5 There is only one Lord, \add Jesus Christ\add*. We all believe the same
\add teaching about him. It was to show that we belong to him\add* alone that
\add we had someone\add* baptize us. 
\v 6 There is one God, who is the \add spiritual\add* Father of all
\add us believers\add*. He \add rules\add* over all his people; he enables all his people
\add to do powerful things\add* \f + \ft (OR, he sustains all his people); and his
\add Spirit lives\add* in all his people. 
\p
\v 7 Christ has generously given to each one of us spiritual gifts, just like he decided to give them.
\v 8  \add When Christ gave\add* gifts to his people\add , it was similar to what the Psalmist said about God receiving tribute
money\add* from those whom he had conquered, 
\q When he ascended to heaven, he gave as gifts to people the things
\add that he had taken\add* from the people whom he captured: 
\p
\v 9 The words ‘he ascended’ certainly imply/indicate \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* that Christ had also previously descended to the earth.
\v 10 Christ, who descended \add to earth\add*, is also the one who ascended to the most exalted position in heaven, in order
that he might show his power \f + \fk metonymy \f* throughout the universe. 
\v 11 He appointed some people to be apostles. He appointed some people to be ◄prophets/ones who reveal messages that come
directly from God►. He appointed some people to be ◄evangelists/ones whose work is to tell others the message about Christ►. He
appointed some people to lead and teach \add the congregations\add*.
\v 12  \add He appointed all of these\add* in order that they would prepare God's people to do
\add God's\add* work, so that all the people who belong to Christ \f + \fk metaphor \f* might become
\add spiritually\add* mature. 
\v 13 He wants all of us \add believers\add* to be united \add because\add* we all believe in the Son of God and
\add because\add* we all know \add him\add*. He wants us to become spiritually mature; that is, he wants us to be ◄perfect/all
that God wants us to be►, \add just like\add* Christ was ◄\add perfect/all that God wanted him to
be\add*►. 
\v 14 Then we will no longer be \add spiritually immature\add*, like \f + \fk metaphor \f* little children
\add are immature\add*. We will no longer be constantly \add changing what we believe,
like\add* \f + \fk metaphor \f* waves of the sea are \add constantly changing as the wind blows
and\add* tosses them back and forth. We will not allow people who teach
\add what is false\add* and who ◄scheme/try cleverly► to deceive/influence us.
\v 15 Instead, by loving \add others\add* as we behave according to
\add God's\add* truth (OR, speak in a loving manner what is true) \f*, we will become more and more like Christ in every way. He is
the one \add who controls/guides all his people\add* \f + \fk metaphor \f*, \add just like a
person's\add* head \add controls/guides his\add* body. 
\v 16 He \add enables all those who belong to him to mature spiritually. Specifically, they will become mature
spiritually\add* by loving each other and by each of them doing the work
\add that God wants them to do. That is like\add* \f + \fk metaphor \f* a person's body
\add grows stronger, as\add* each part of the body is joined to the others by the ligaments and as each part ◄functions
properly/works as it should►. 
\s Ephesians 4:17-32 
\s You should conduct yourselves in a way that matches your new character; so stop doing the harmful things that unbelievers
do, and do good to one another. 
\p
\v 17 By \add the authority of\add* the Lord \add Jesus\add*, I strongly ◄affirm/tell you► that you must no longer conduct your
lives like unbelievers do. The futile/worthless way in which they think \f + \fk metaphor \f*
\add controls how they conduct their lives\add*. 
\v 18 They are unable to think clearly \f + \fk metaphor \f* \add about what is right and what is
wrong\add*. Because they have decided that they do not want to know about God and because they stubbornly \f + \fk idiom \f* refuse to
\add listen to his message\add*, they do not have the \add eternal\add* life that God
\add gives us\add*. 
\v 19 The result is that because they have ceased ◄to care/to be concerned►
\add about what is right and what is wrong\add*, they have ◄deliberately committed themselves to doing/wholeheartedly decided
to do► the shameful things that their bodies want, and they commit all kinds of immoral acts, and continually are eager to do
more of those things. 
\p
\v 20 But when you learned \add about\add* Christ, you did not learn
\add to behave\add* like that. 
\v 21 I am sure that you heard the message about \add Christ\add*, and because you are people who have a close relationship
with him, you were taught {\add others\add* taught you} the true
\add way to live\add* that Jesus \add showed us\add*. 
\v 22  \add You were taught\add* {\add They taught you\add*} that you must put aside \f + \fk metaphor \f* your evil
nature\add ; that is, that you must not behave like you formerly
did\add*. Your evil desires deceived you, making you want to do evil things and causing you to think that
\add doing that was good for you\add*; and your thinking like that was destroying you
\add spiritually\add*. 
\v 23 Others taught you that instead, you must let \add God's Spirit\add* change the way you think,
\v 24 and that you must start being \f + \fk metaphor \f* the new persons that God made you to become. That is, your
\add behavior\add* must be righteous and truly/genuinely devout.
\p
\v 25 Therefore, quit lying to one another. Instead, because we all belong to just one group
\add of believers\add*, speak truthfully to each other. 
\v 26 If you get angry, do not sin \add as a result of\add* getting angry. Before the end of the day \f + \fk metonymy \f*, stop being angry
\v 27 and \add by doing that\add*, do not allow the devil to make you do evil.
\v 28 Those who have been stealing must not steal any longer. Instead, they should work hard to earn ◄their living/what they
need► ◄\add by\add* their own efforts/\add by\add* what they do themselves► \f + \fk metonymy \f*, in order that they may have
\add something\add* to give to those who are needy. 
\v 29 Do not use \f + \fk metonymy \f* foul language. Instead, say only things that are suitable/useful for helping people when they need help,
things that will help \add spiritually\add* the people that you talk to.
\v 30  \add God has given you his\add* Spirit ◄to confirm/to assure you► that some day
\add God will claim all\add* you people \add whom Christ has\add* redeemed \f + \fk metaphor \f*,
\add just like people confirm that something belongs to them by\add* putting their seal on it. So do not cause God's Holy
Spirit to be sad ◄\add by the way you talk/by the things that you
say\add*►. 
\v 31 Do not be resentful at all towards others. Do not become angry in any way. Never shout abusively at others. Never
◄slander/say bad things about► others. Never act maliciously/be mean in any way.
\v 32 Be kind to one another. Act mercifully toward each other. Forgive each other, just like God forgave you because of
\add what\add* Christ \add has done\add*.
