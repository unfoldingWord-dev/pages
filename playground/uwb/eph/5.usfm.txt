\c 5  
\s Ephesians 5:1-6 
\s Imitate God, do everything in a way that shows love, and do not let anyone persuade you to live immorally, because God will
punish those who disobey him. 
\p
\v 1 ◄Imitate\f + \ft Or: Behave \f* like► God, because he loves you who are \add as though you
were\add* \\f + \\ft simile \\f* his children. 
\v 2 Do everything in a way that shows that you love \add people\add*, just like Christ loved us and willingly died for us. He
offered himself \add to God as a sacrifice\add* that was very pleasing to God,
\add just like Jewish priests offered\add* sweet-smelling \add animal\add* sacrifices to God \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f*.
\v 3 Do not commit any kind of immoral act \\f + \\ft doublet \\f*, and do not desire more things than you need. Do not
\add act in such a way that others could\add* even ◄spread rumors\f + \ft Or: talk \f*► about your acting in such ways, because it is not
appropriate\f + \ft Or: fitting \f* for God's people to do such things. 
\v 4 Do not use obscene\f + \ft Or: shameful \f* language when you talk to people. Do not talk foolishly. Do not use vulgar\f + \ft Or: indecent \f* language,
because it is not appropriate\f + \ft Or: fitting \f* that God's people should talk like that. Instead, tell people how much you thank
\add God for all he does for you\add*. 
\v 5 You can be sure of this: No person who is sexually immoral or who acts indecently\f + \ft Or: shamefully \f* will be among those people
whom God rules over \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* \add in heaven\add*. Neither will those who desire more things than they need. Such people worship
their possessions \add instead of worshipping God\add*. 
\v 6 Do not let anyone deceive you by suggesting that \add God will
really\add* not \add punish people who commit such sins\add*, because God certainly will punish \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* those who habitually
disobey him \add by doing such things\add*. 
\s Ephesians 5:7-21 
\s Live righteously, and expose the evil deeds that evil people do, because when you do that, those people who do those evil
things will come to know the truth. 
\p
\v 7 So, do not commit the same kind of deeds that such people do,
\v 8 because formerly you \add did not know God's truth\add* \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f*,
\add as those who\add* are in darkness \add do not know what is around
them\add*. But now \add it is as though\add* you are in the light \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f*
\add because you know God's truth\add* because of your relationship with the Lord
\add Jesus\add*. So do those things that those who know God's truth \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* should do.
\v 9 Keep in mind that \add as\add* light \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* produces \add things that are good, those who know God's truth should do those
things\add* that are good, righteous, and honest. 
\v 10 And as \add you do that\add*, try ◄to find out\f + \ft Or: to \f* discover► what pleases the Lord.
\v 11 Do not do the worthless deeds that the people ◄who are in \add spiritual\add* darkness\f + \ft Or: who \f* do not know God's truth► \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f*
do. Instead, let others know that those people's deeds are worthless.
\v 12 It is shameful for God's people to even talk \add among themselves
about\add* those evil deeds that evil people do secretly and habitually.
\v 13 But when \add God's people rebuke those evil people about their deeds, it will be clear\f + \ft Or: evident \f* how evil their deeds
really are, just like\add* everything exposed to the light becomes visible {as light \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* reveals everything
\add that we cannot see in the darkness\add*}. 
\v 14  \add Just like something on which a light shines reflects that
light\add* \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f*, \add whoever has learned God's truth reveals that truth to
others\add*. That is why \add we believers\add* say this: 
\q You who are not aware of your sins, become aware of them \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f*!
\q It is as though you are sound asleep, so wake up! 
\q Be like dead people who are becoming alive again! 
\q Christ will cause you to know God's truth, just like a light \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f*
\q that shines causes people to know what is in the darkness. 
\p
\v 15 So be very careful how you behave. Do not behave as foolish people do. Instead, behave as wise people do.
\v 16 Use your time carefully, because in these days \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* \add people
do\add* extremely evil \add deeds\add*. 
\v 17 Because of that, do not be foolish. Instead, understand what the Lord
\add Jesus\add* wants you to do, \add and do it!\add* 
\p
\v 18 Do not become drunk by drinking alcoholic drinks, since people are unable to control their behavior when they are drunk.
Instead, let \add God's\add* Spirit control your \add behavior\add* at all times \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f*.
\v 19 Sing to each other ◄Psalms\f + \ft Or: songs \f* \add with words from the\add* Scriptures►, sing
\add other\add* songs \add that the congregation knows\add*, and songs
\add that God's\add* Spirit \add gives you\add*. Sing these Psalms and other songs sincerely to
\add praise\add* the Lord \add Jesus\add*. 
\v 20 At all times thank God, who is our \add heavenly\add* Father, for everything, because of what the Lord Jesus Christ \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f*
\add has done for you\add*. 
\v 21  \add Humbly\add* submit yourselves to each other because you reverence Christ,
\add who is our example\add*. 
\s Ephesians 5:22-6:9 
\s Instructions about how wives and husbands, children and parents, and slaves and masters should behave toward each other.
\p
\v 22-23 Because husbands have authority over \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* their wives, just as all of us believers form one group
\add under the authority of\add* Christ, you women should submit yourselves to
\add the authority of your\add* husbands just as you submit yourselves to the Lord
\add Jesus\add*. He is the one who saves all his people \add from the guilt of their
sins\add*. 
\v 24 Just like all believers submit themselves to \add the authority
of\add* Christ, the women must submit themselves completely to the
\add authority of\add* their husbands. 
\p
\v 25 Each of you husbands, love your wife as Christ loved all of
\add us who would become\add* believers, with the result that he willingly died for our sake,
\v 26 in order that he might ◄set us apart for himself\f + \ft Or: cause \f* us to belong to him►. That is, by
\add revealing his\add* message \add to us\add*, he wanted to \add remove the guilt of our sin, just like people remove dirt
from something\add* by washing it \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f*. 
\v 27  \add Christ did that\add* in order that he might cause all of us believers to be a glorious group of people that belong
to him, people that do not have any moral flaws\f + \ft Or: imperfections \f*, but instead might be completely pure \\f + \\ft doublet \\f* when he gathers us
◄to his presence\f + \ft Or: to \f* himself►. 
\v 28 In the same way, each man should love his wife as he loves his own body. Men who love their wives,
\add it is as though\add* they love themselves. 
\v 29-30 This is shown by the fact that no one ever hated his own body. Instead, he feeds his own body and cares for it, just
like Christ also cares for all us believers. We have become one group of believers that belongs to him \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f*.
\v 31  \add What someone has written in the Scriptures about people who marry is
this\add*, 
\q \add When\add* a man and \add a\add* woman \add marry\add*, they should
◄\add permanently\add* leave\f + \ft Or: no \f* longer live with► their fathers and mothers. They should be joined
\add as husband and\add* wife, and the two of them shall become \add as though they
were\add* one \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* person. 
\p
\v 32 It is very difficult to understand the meaning of these things that God has now revealed to me, but
\add I am telling you that\add* those words \add also\add* refer to
\add the relationship between\add* Christ and all those who belong to him.
\v 33 However, as for you, each man must love his wife just as he loves himself, and each woman must respect her husband.
