\s Ephesians 2:1-10 
\s Formerly we were all spiritually dead and were certain to be punished by God, but he acted very kindly toward us and saved
us freely as a result of our faith in Christ. 
\p
\v 1 Formerly, because you were habitually sinning \f + \ft doublet \f*, you were
\add spiritually\add* dead\f + \ft Or: \add as unable to please God as a\add* corpse \f + \ft metaphor \f* is \f*.
\v 2 You were acting in the same \add evil\add* way as those who oppose Christ \f + \ft metonymy \f* act. That is, you were behaving in the
\add evil\add* ways \add that Satan wanted you to behave\add*. He rules over evil spiritual beings that no person can see
\f + \ft metonymy \f*. He is the spirit who now powerfully controls the people who disobey God.
\v 3 Formerly, we all used to disobey God as they do. We did the things that our self-centered nature wanted us to do. We
habitually did those \add evil\add* deeds that our bodies and our minds wanted. When we were acting like that, it was certain
that \add God\add* would punish \f + \ft metonymy \f* us, just like he will certainly punish all other
\add evil people\add*. 
\p
\v 4 But God always acts very mercifully, and he loves us very much.
\v 5 As a result, even when we were ◄\add spiritually\add* dead\f + \ft Or:  \f*\add as unable to please God
as\add* a corpse \f + \ft metaphor \f* is► because we were habitually sinning, he enabled us to receive
\add spiritual\add*\f + \ft Or:  \f*\add eternal\add* life because of our relationship with Christ.
\add Do not forget this: It is only\add* because God has acted so kindly toward you, in a way that you did not deserve, that
you are saved {that \add he\add* saved you} \add from the guilt of your
sin\add*! 
\v 6 And \add it is as though\add* God gave us spiritual life when he caused Christ Jesus to be alive again after he died
\f + \ft metaphor \f*. And \add it is as though\add* God caused us to sit \add and
rule\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* with him in heaven, 
\v 7 in order that he might show to everyone at all times in the future that he has acted toward us in an extremely kind way
because of what Christ Jesus \add did for us\add*. 
\p
\v 8 It is \add only\add* by \add God\add* acting \f + \ft personification \f* \add toward
you\add* in a way that you did not deserve that you have been saved {that he has saved you} as a result of your trusting
\add in Christ\add*. You did not save yourselves. His saving you was his gift to you.
\v 9 He did not save any of you because of anything you yourselves did. The result is that no one can be proud of what they
have done \add to save themselves\add*. 
\v 10 It is God who has made us what we are now. Because of our relationship with Christ Jesus, he has enabled us to receive
\add spiritual\f + \ft Or: eternal \f*\add* life in order that we should conduct our lives habitually doing the good deeds that God previously
planned for us to do. 
\s Ephesians 2:11-22 
\s God brought you Gentiles into his family so that now you and Jewish believers both share the same blessings and form one
group; you now have peace with each other and can come to God in prayer with the help of the Holy Spirit.
\p
\v 11 You \add Ephesians\add* were non-Jews from the time that you were born. The Jews
\add insult you\f + \ft Or: say that you are not God's people\add* \f* \add by\add* calling you ‘those who are not circumcised.’ They
\add proudly\add* call themselves ‘we\add (exc)\add* who are circumcised.’
\add They have allowed people to\add* circumcise \add them to indicate that they are God's people,
but\add* that has \add only\add* changed their bodies, \add not their\add*
\add inner beings\f + \ft Or: hearts\add* \f*. 
\v 12 You should constantly remember these things: Formerly you did not have any relationship with Christ. You did not belong
to the people of Israel, \add the people whom God chose\add*. You did not know about the things God promised in his agreements
\add with his people\add*. You did not confidently expect to go to heaven after you die \f + \ft Or:
\add that God would save you\add* \f*. You \add lived\add* in this world without knowing God.
\v 13 But now, because of your relationship with Christ Jesus, God has brought you, who had no relationship with him \f + \ft metaphor \f*,
into his family \f + \ft metaphor \f*. He did that because \add you trusted in what Christ accomplished
when\add* his blood \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add flowed from his body when he died on the
cross\add*. 
\p
\v 14 Christ himself \add has caused us Jewish and non-Jewish believers\add* to have peace
\add with each other\add*. He has made both \add of our groups\add* to become one
\add group\add*. \add Just like people\add* tear down\f + \ft Or: demolish \f* a wall that separates
\add groups of people\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, he has destroyed the hatred \add between Jews and
non-Jews\add*. 
\v 15 By dying \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add for us on the cross\add* he made it no longer
\add necessary for us to obey\add* all the \add Jewish\add* laws and rituals
\add in order to be saved\add*. He did that in order to enable the two
\add groups\add* to become one new group because of our relationship with him. The result was that he has caused us to have
peace \add with each other\add*. 
\v 16 By \add dying on\add* the cross \f + \ft metonymy \f* he caused both Jews and non-Jews to have a peaceful relationship with God. That is
how he caused us to no longer be \f + \ft metaphor \f* enemies \add with God\add* \f + \ft Or:
\add with each other\add* \f*. 
\v 17 He came \add to earth\add* and proclaimed that you \add non-Jews\add*, who did not have a relationship with \f + \ft metaphor \f*
\add God\add*, and \add us(exc) Jews\add*, who \add considered that we(exc) belonged
to\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* God's \add family\add*, can \add all\add* now have peace
\add with God\add*. 
\v 18  \add We know that he has done that\add* because we both, \add Jews and
non-Jews\add*, are \add now\add* able to approach God the Father in prayer by the help of his Spirit, because of what Christ
\add has done\add*. 
\p
\v 19 So \add God no longer treats\add* you \add non-Jews\add* as
\add people treat\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* foreigners and strangers \add who live among
them\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. Instead, along with all God's people, \add it is as
though\add* you have become citizens of a country that he rules over, and
\add as though you have become\add* members of the family\add of which he is the
father\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. 
\v 20  \add Just like\add* a building is built {\add as someone\add* builds a building} on a foundation,
\add God has joined you into one group that originated\f + \ft Or: began \f*\add* from what the apostles and prophets
\add taught\add*. Christ Jesus is the \add most important one in that group, just like
a\add* cornerstone \add is the most important part of a building\add*. And
\v 21 just like \add a builder might\add* join together all the parts of a building to make it a temple that
\add people will\add* dedicate to the Lord \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add Christ is continually causing all
of\add* you who have a relationship with \add him to be united, in order that you will become one holy
group\add*. 
\v 22 And because of your relationship with Christ, \add God\add* is joining you
\add non-Jews\add* together with \add Jewish believers\add* to be
\add like\add* one building \f + \ft metaphor \f* in which his Spirit lives.
