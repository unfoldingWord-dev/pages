\v 1  \add The rulers of Moab will say to each other\add*, 
\q “We must send some lambs from Sela \add city\add* as a gift to the ruler of Judah
\add to persuade him to not allow his army to attack us anymore\add*.
\q2 We should send them through the desert to the king \add in Jerusalem\add*.
\q
\v 2 The women of Moab will be left alone at the ◄fords of/places where people can walk across► the Arnon
\add River\add*; 
\q2 they will be like [SIM] birds that have been pushed out of their nests.
\q
\v 3 They will cry out, ‘Help us! 
\q2 Tell us what we should do! 
\q Protect us completely [MET], 
\q2 we who are running away \add from our enemies\add*, 
\q and do not ◄betray us/tell our enemies where we are►. 
\q
\v 4 Allow \add those of us\add* who are fleeing from Moab to stay with you;
\q2 hide/protect us from \add our enemies who want to\add* destroy us!’
\b
\q \add Some day\add* there will be no one to oppress us, 
\q2 and our enemies will stop destroying \add our land\add*. 
\q
\v 5 Then Yahweh will appoint someone to be king 
\q2 who will be \add a descendant of King\add* David. 
\q2 As he rules [MTY], he will be merciful and truthful. 
\q He will always do what is fair/just 
\q2 and quickly do what is righteous.” 
\b
\q
\v 6 We \add people of Judah\add* have heard about \add the people
of\add* Moab; 
\q2 we have heard that they are very proud and conceited [DOU]; 
\q they are insolent, 
\q2 but what they say about themselves is not true. 
\q
\v 7  \add Some day all the people in\add* Moab will weep. 
\q2 They will all mourn, 
\q because \add there will be no more\add* raisin cakes in Kir-Hareseth
\add city\add*. 
\q
\v 8 The crops in the fields at Heshbon \add city\add* will wither,
\q2 and the vineyards at Sibmah \add town\add* will wither also.
\q The armies of other nations will destroy Moab, 
\q2 which is like [MET] a beautiful grapevine 
\q whose branches spread \add north\add* to Jazer \add town\add*
\q2 and \add east\add* to the desert. 
\q Its branches spread very far \add west\add*, 
\q2 to the west side of the \add Dead\add* Sea. 
\q
\v 9 So I will weep for Jazer 
\q2 and for the grapevines of Sibmah. 
\q I will shed tears for all of you. 
\q I will cry because people will no longer shout joyfully, like they usually do
\q2 when they gather the fruit that ripens in the ◄summer/hot season► and the other crops that they harvest.
\q
\v 10 People will no longer be glad at harvest time. 
\q2 No one will sing in the vineyards, 
\q no one will shout joyfully. 
\q2 No one will tread on grapes \add to get grape juice for wine\add*;
\q2 there will be nothing to shout about \add joyfully\add*. 
\q
\v 11 I cry in my inner being for Moab; 
\q2 my groaning is like [SIM] \add a sad song played on\add* a harp.
\q I am sad in my inner being for Kir-Hareseth. 
\q
\v 12 The people of Moab will go and pray at their sacred shrines,
\q2 but that will not help them. 
\q They will cry out to their gods in their temples, 
\q2 but no one will be able to rescue them. 
\p
\v 13 Yahweh has already spoken those things about Moab. 
\v 14 But now he says that exactly three years from now, he will destroy all the things that
\add the people of\add* Moab have been proud of. Even though they have a huge number of people in Moab now, only a few people
will remain alive, and they will be weak/helpless.
