\v 1  \add I\add*, Paul, \add am writing this letter\add*. Silas and Timothy
\add are with me\add*. \add We(exc) are sending this letter\add* to
\add you who are\add* the congregation \add of believers\add* in Thessalonica
\add city\add*. We\add (inc)\add* all \add worship\add* (OR, \add trust
in\add*) God \add our\add* Father [MET] and \add our\add* Lord Jesus Christ.
\add We three desire/pray that God, our Father, and Jesus Christ, our Lord, will continue
to\add* act kindly toward you and \add will continue to\add* cause you to have
\add inner\add* peace. 
\s 1 Thessalonians 1:2-10 
\s We always thank God for you all. We continually remember the way you live as believers and we know that God chose you. The
Holy Spirit enabled us to powerfully tell you the good message, and although people persecuted you greatly, you were joyful. As
a result, you inspired all the believers who are in Macedonia and Achaia to trust in God firmly, as you do.
\p
\v 2 We always thank God for you all \add when\add* we mention you while we pray (OR,
\add when\add* we pray \add for you\add*). 
\v 3  \add We thank God because\add* we continually remember that you work
\add for God because\add* you trust \add in him\add* and you earnestly/energetically help people because you love them. You
also endure \add it when people cause you to suffer\add*. You endure it because you confidently expect that our Lord Jesus
Christ \add will soon return from heaven to rescue you!\add* 
\v 4 My fellow believers whom God loves, we \add also thank him because\add* we know that he chose you
\add to become his people\add*. 
\v 5 We know that he chose you because \add when\add* we told that message to you, we did not speak only words. The Holy Spirit
\add helped us to speak\add* powerfully/effectively, and he strongly assured
\add us that he was powerfully working in you by means of\add* the message
\add about Christ\add* that we \add told to you. You yourselves know
that\add*, because you know how we spoke and how we conducted ourselves when we were with you, in order that
\add we might help\add* you. 
\v 6 We also \add know that God chose you\add* because we have now heard that you have endured your troubles when
\add people\add* caused you to suffer very much \add because you believed in
Christ\add*. You endured just like the Lord \add Jesus Christ\add* endured, and just like we did
\add when people caused us to suffer\add*. At that time you were joyful because the Holy Spirit caused you to be joyful.
\v 7 As a result \add of your joyfully enduring your troubles\add*, all the believers who live in Macedonia and Achaia
\add provinces have heard how firmly you trust God. So they know that they should firmly trust in
God\add* as you do. 
\v 8 Other people have heard you tell the message \add from\add* the Lord
\add Jesus\add*. Then they also have proclaimed the message to people who live throughout Macedonia and Achaia
\add provinces\add*. Not only that, but \add people who live\add* in many far-away places [HYP] have heard that you trust in
God. As a result, we do not need to tell people \add what God has done in your
lives\add*. 
\v 9 People \add who live far from you are telling others what happened when we were with
you\add*. They also report that you stopped \add worshipping things
that\add* ◄\add you/your ancestors\add*► \add considered to be\add* gods and now you worship God.
\add As a result\add*, you serve the God who is all-powerful and who is the real God.
\v 10 They tell us that now you wait expectantly for his Son \add to return to
earth\add* from heaven. You firmly believe that God caused him to live again after he died. You believe also that Jesus will
rescue \add all of\add* us, \add who trust in him\add*, from \add God's\add* punishing us [MTY].
