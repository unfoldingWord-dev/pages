\v 1  \add I\add*, Paul, and Timothy, \add who is with me, are\add* men who serve Christ Jesus. I
\add am writing this letter\add* to all \add of you who are\add* pastors and deacons in Philippi
\add city\add* and to the rest of God's people \add there who have a close
relationship\add* with Christ Jesus. 
\v 2  \add We both\add* \f + \ft (OR\add , I\add*) \add pray that\add* God,
\add who is\add* our Father, and Jesus Christ, \add who is our\add* Lord,
\add will continue to\add* act kindly toward you and \add will continue
to\add* cause you to have \add inner\add* peace. 
\s Philippians 1:3-8 
\s I thank God and rejoice because you have been working together with me to make known the good message from when you first
believed until now. 
\p
\v 3 I thank my God whenever I think about you. 
\v 4 Every time \\f + \\ft doublet \\f* I pray \add for you\add*, I joyfully pray \\f + \\ft doublet \\f* for all of you.
\v 5 I \add thank God and rejoice\add* because you have been \add working\add* together with me in order to
\add make known\add* the good message about Christ. \add You started doing
that\add* when you first \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* \add believed it, and you have continued doing
it\add* until now. 
\v 6 I am completely confident that \add God\add*, who has begun to perform in you what is good, (OR, that since
\add God\add* has begun to perform in you what is good, he) will continue to do that until he finishes doing it on the day
Christ Jesus \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* \add returns\add*. 
\v 7 During this time that I have been a prisoner \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* and during the times I was previously able to defend the good message
about Christ and proved\f + \ft Or: confirmed \f* \add to others\add* that it is true, all of you have been sharing with me (OR, have helped
me) in this work \add that God\add* kindly gave \add to me to do.
So\add* indeed it is right that I feel joyful about you all, because you are very dear \\f + \\ft idiom \\f* to me.
\v 8 God \add can\add* verify that Christ Jesus causes me to \add love
and\add* long for all of you very much, \add just like\add* Christ loves
\add you\add*. 
\s Philippians 1:9-11 
\s I pray that God will enable you to know how to love one another more and more appropriately and to completely understand how
you should believe and act. 
\p
\v 9 And what I pray \add for you\add* is that \add God will enable\add* you to truly know and discern how to love
\add one another\add* more and more in a proper way in every situation.
\v 10  \add And I pray that he will enable\add* you to completely understand
\add how you should believe and act\add*. I \add pray this\add* in order that you might be
\add spiritually\add* pure and faultless (OR, completely faultless \\f + \\ft doublet \\f*) on the day that Christ
\add returns\add* \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f*, 
\v 11  \add and in order that\add* you might conduct your lives \\f + \\ft idiom \\f* completely righteously as a result of Jesus Christ
\add enabling you to do so\add*, in order that \add people will\add* honor God and praise him (OR,
\add people will\add* praise God very much \\f + \\ft doublet \\f*). 
\s Philippians 1:12-14 
\s I want you to realize that as a result of my imprisonment many more people have heard the good message about Christ.
\p
\v 12 My fellow believers, I want you to know that the \add troubles\add* I have experienced
\add have not prevented me from proclaiming the good message to people.
Instead\add*, \add these things that I have experienced\add* have enabled even more people to hear the good message
\add about Christ\add*. 
\v 13  \add Specifically\add*, all the military guards who are stationed
\add here in Rome\add* and many other \\f + \\ft hyperbole \\f* \add people in this city\add* \\f + \\ft hyperbole \\f* now know that I am a prisoner \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* because I
\add proclaim the good news\add* about Christ. 
\v 14 Also, most of the believers \add here now\add* proclaim the message from God more courageously and fearlessly
\add because\add* they trust the Lord \add more firmly to help them. They trust the Lord
more\add* because \add they have seen how the Lord has helped me\add* while I have been a prisoner \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f*
\add here\add*. 
\s Philippians 1:15-18a 
\s Even though some believers proclaim the message about Christ because they are antagonistic toward me, at least they are
proclaiming Christ, and so I rejoice. 
\p
\v 15-16 Some people proclaim \add the message about Christ as I
do\add* because they are happy \add with my work\add*. They proclaim
\add the message about\add* Christ because they love \add me and
because\add* they know that \add God\add* has placed me \add here\add* in order that I defend the message about Christ \\f + \\ft chiasmus \\f*.
\v 17 Others proclaim \add the message about\add* Christ because they envy
\add me\add* and oppose \add me\add*. Those people want to exalt themselves
\add above me. They proclaim the message about Christ because they
have\add* wrong motives. They \add wrongly\add* assume \add that because they are causing many people to follow them, I will be
jealous, and as a result\add*, I will feel more miserable while I am a prisoner \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f*
\add here\add*. 
\v 18 But ◄it does not matter!\f + \ft Or: what \f* does it matter?► \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* It does not matter whether
\add people proclaim the message about Christ\add* because they have wrong motives, or whether
\add people proclaim the message about Christ\add* because they have right motives. The important thing in either case is that
\add the message about\add* Christ is being proclaimed {people are proclaiming
\add the message about\add* Christ}. And because of that I rejoice!
\s Philippians 1:18b-26 
\s I will continue to rejoice because I know that I will remain completely victorious spiritually because I earnestly expect to
boldly honor Christ whether I live or die. 
\p Furthermore, I will continue to rejoice, 
\v 19 because I know that the outcome of these \add troubles that I am
experiencing\add* will \add be that some day God will\add* say that he approves
\add of what I have done\add* (OR, that \add the Roman authorities\add* will set me free).
\add This will happen\add* as a result of your praying for me, and
\add as a result\add* of \add God's\add* Spirit, whom Jesus Christ gave me, helping me.
\v 20 I \add know that this will happen\add* because I very confidently expect \\f + \\ft doublet \\f* that in no way I will be reluctant
\add to honor Christ\add*. Instead, just like I always \add have
done\add*, Christ will be greatly honored {I will continue now also to very boldly honor Christ} by means of all that I do
[SYN, MTY], whether by \add the way I\add* live or \add by the way
I\add* die. 
\p
\v 21 As for me, I live \add in order to honor\add* Christ. But if I die, it will be better
\add for me than if I continue to live, because then I will be completely united with
him\add*. 
\v 22 On the other hand, if I continue to live, that will enable me to continue to serve
\add Christ\add* effectively. As a result, I do not know whether I prefer
\add to live or to die\add*. 
\v 23 That is, I am not sure which of those two I \add prefer\add*. I long to leave
\add this world\add* and \add go to\add* be with Christ, because that will be very much better
\add for me\add*. 
\v 24 Nevertheless, it is more important that I remain alive \add than that I go to be with Christ
because\add* you still need \add me to help you\add*. 
\v 25 Since I am convinced of this, I know that I will remain \add alive\add* and that I will
\add go\f + \ft Or: come \f* to\add* be with you all. \add As a result\add*, you will believe
\add in Christ\add* more firmly, and \add as a result of that\add*, you will rejoice.
\v 26  \add That is\add*, you will be able to rejoice very greatly because of Christ Jesus
\add bringing\add* me \add to be with you again\add*. 
\s Philippians 1:27-30 
\s Conduct yourselves just like you learned in the message about Christ, unitedly and fearlessly resisting those who oppose you
and the gospel, since God is helping you in all your struggles. 
\p
\v 27 Most importantly, as fellow \add believers in Christ\add*, conduct yourselves just like
\add you learned you should do when you heard\add* the message about Christ. Do that in order that whether I come and see you,
or whether \add I am away from you and\add* people tell me about you,
\add what I hear or see will make me happy\add*. They will tell me that you are unitedly and cooperatively resisting
\add those who oppose the message about Christ\add* (OR, \add oppose
you\add*) \f*. I \add will know\add* that you are not allowing others to influence you to believe a message that is different from
the good message \add about Christ\add*. 
\v 28 And I \add will know\add* that you are not at all frightened by {afraid of} the people who oppose you. This will
show\f + \ft Or: prove \f* to those people that \add God\add* will destroy them, but this will show\f + \ft Or: prove \f* to you that
\add God\add* will save you eternally. It is God who is doing \add all\add* this.
\v 29 Remember that he has not only kindly enabled you to believe in Christ,
\add he\add* has also kindly allowed you to suffer for the sake of Christ.
\v 30  \add As a result\add*, you are \add having to\add* resist
\add those who oppose the good message\add*, just like you saw that I
\add had to\add* resist \add such people there in Philippi\add*, and just like you hear that I
\add still have to resist such people here\add* now.
