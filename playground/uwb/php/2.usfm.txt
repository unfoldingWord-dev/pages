\s Philippians 2:1-4 
\s Since Christ loves and encourages us and the Holy Spirit fellowships with us, make me completely happy by agreeing with one
another, loving one another, and humbly serving one another. 
\p
\v 1 Since Christ encourages us, since he loves us and comforts us, since God's Spirit fellowships with
\add us, and\add* since \add Christ\add* is very merciful \f + \ft doublet \f* to us,
\v 2 make me completely happy \add by doing the following things\add*: Agree with one another, love one another, be closely
united with one another, and \add live\add* harmoniously with one another \f + \ft doublet \f*.
\v 3 Never try to selfishly make yourselves more important than \add others\add* nor boast
\add about what you are doing\add*. Instead, be humble, \add and in
particular\add*, honor one another more than you honor yourselves.
\v 4 Each one of you should not \add only\add* be concerned about your own affairs. Instead, each of you should also be
concerned that you help\f + \ft Or: about \f* the needs of one another. 
\s Philippians 2:5-11 
\s You should think just like Christ Jesus thought. He willingly gave up his divine privileges and humbled himself, willingly
obeying God although it meant having the disgrace of dying on a cross. As a result, God exalted him to the highest position, to
be acknowledged by the entire universe as the supreme Lord. 
\p
\v 5 You should think\f + \ft Or: act \f* just like Christ Jesus \add thought\f + \ft Or: acted \f*\add*.
\v 6  \add Although\add* he has the same nature as God has, he did not insist on keeping all the privileges of being equal with
God. 
\v 7 Instead, he \add willingly\add* gave up divine privileges. \add Specifically\add*, he became a human being and took the
attitude of a servant. When he had become a human being, 
\v 8 he humbled himself \add even more. Specifically\add*, he obeyed
\add God\add* even to the extent of \add being willing to\add* die.
\add He was even willing to\add* be nailed to a cross, \add to die as though he was a
criminal\add*. 
\v 9 As a result, God raised him \add to a\add* rank \add that\add* is above every
\add other\add* rank. 
\v 10  \add God did that\add* in order that every being \f + \ft synecdoche \f* in heaven and on earth and under the earth should worship \f + \ft metonymy \f*
Jesus, 
\v 11 and in order that every person \f + \ft synecdoche \f* should declare that Jesus Christ is Lord.
\add As a result of everyone doing that, they will\add* honor God,
\add his\add* Father. 
\s Philippians 2:12-13 
\s Since you have always obeyed God, continue to try to do those things which are appropriate for people whom God has saved,
and he will enable you to do so. 
\p
\v 12 My dear friends, as you consider this, since you have always obeyed
\add God\add*, each of you should very reverentially \f + \ft doublet \f* try to do those things
\add that are proper for people whom God has\add* saved. \add You should do those
things\add* not only when I am with you. \add Instead, you should
try\add* even more \add to do them\add* now when I am not with you.
\v 13  \add You are able to do these things\add*, since God \add himself\add* causes you to desire to do what he wants you to
do, and he also enables you to do what he wants you to do. 
\s Philippians 2:14-16 
\s Obey God and your leaders always, and never complain against them or argue with them, in order that you may be perfect
children of God, witnessing by life and word to the ungodly people among whom you live.
\p
\v 14 Do everything \add God or your leaders ask you to do\add*. Never complain about what they want you to do or argue with
them. 
\v 15 Behave like that in order that you may be completely faultless \f + \ft doublet \f* and may be perfect children of God \f + \ft doublet \f* while you
live in the midst of people who are wicked and do very wicked things \f + \ft doublet \f*. As you live among them, show them clearly \f + \ft metaphor \f*
\add the way they ought to behave\add*, just like the sun, moon, and stars
\add show an earthly road clearly to us\add* \f + \ft simile \f*. 
\v 16 Tell them the message about how \add to\add* have eternal life. I
\add ask that you do that\add* in order that on the day Christ \add returns\add* I may be able to rejoice \f + \ft metonymy \f*, that I did not
labor \f + \ft doublet \f* so hard among you in vain. 
\s Philippians 2:17-18 
\s Because I and all of you dedicate ourselves together to do God's will, even if I am to be executed, I will rejoice, and you
should also rejoice. 
\p
\v 17 Perhaps \add the Roman authorities\add* will execute me, \add and my blood will pour
out\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add as the\add* wine pours out when the priest offers it to God \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\add For your part\add*, you believe \add in Christ firmly\add*. As a result, you have given yourselves completely to God in
order that you might do what he wills \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add just like a priest\add* offers a sacrifice
\add completely to God\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. \add Because I dedicate myself wholly to
God\add* together with you, even if \add they are about to execute
me\add*, I will greatly rejoice \f + \ft doublet \f*, \add because I am giving myself wholly to
God\add*, and because you all \add are giving yourselves wholly to
God\add*. 
\v 18 Similarly, you too should rejoice \add because you are giving yourselves wholly to
God\add*, and you should rejoice because I \add am giving myself wholly to
God\add*. 
\s Philippians 2:19-24 
\s I confidently expect that the Lord Jesus will enable me to send Timothy to you soon. He genuinely cares for your welfare,
not his own interests. I am confident that the Lord will enable me also to come soon.
\p
\v 19 My relationship with the Lord Jesus \add leads me\add* to confidently expect that
\add he will enable me\add* to send Timothy to you soon, in order that
\add his telling you the news about me will encourage you. But\add* I also expect that
\add his returning to me and\add* telling me the news about you will encourage me.
\v 20  \add Keep in mind that\add* I have no one \add else\add* like him who genuinely cares for you.
\v 21 All the others \add whom I have considered that I might send to
you\add* are concerned \add only\add* about their own matters. They are not concerned about what Jesus Christ
\add considers important\add*. 
\v 22 But you know that Timothy has proved that he \add serves the Lord and others faithfully. You
know\add* that he has served \add the Lord closely together\add* with me in
\add proclaiming to people\add* the message about Christ as though he were \f + \ft simile \f* my son and I were his
\add own\add* father. 
\v 23 So then he is the one I confidently expect to send \add to
you\add* as soon as I know what will happen to me. 
\v 24 And I am confident that I will soon be released \f + \ft Or:\add the authorities will soon release
me\add* \f* \add so that\add* the Lord will enable me also to come\f + \ft Or: go \f*
\add to you\add* soon. 
\s Philippians 2:25-30 
\s Since Epaphroditus longs to see you and is distressed, I am sending him back to you. So welcome him very joyfully. Since he
nearly died while serving me on your behalf, honor him and all people like him.
\p
\v 25 I have concluded that it is \add really\add* necessary that I send Epaphroditus
\add back\add* to you. He is a fellow believer and my fellow worker, and he
\add endures difficulties together with me\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add just
like\add* soldiers \add endure together difficulties\add*. You sent him
\add to me\add* in order that he might help me when I was needy \f + \ft euphemism \f*.
\v 26  \add But I have concluded that I must send him back to you\add* because he has been longing to see you all. Furthermore,
he has been \add very\add* distressed because \add he knows that\add* you heard that he had become sick.
\v 27 Indeed, he was so sick that he almost died. However, \add he did not
die\add*. Instead, God pitied him and he also pitied me, \add and as a result he healed him. God pitied
me\add* because he did not want me to be even more sorrowful than I already was.
\v 28 So, I am sending him \add back to you\add* as quickly as possible in order that you may rejoice
\add when you see him again\add* and in order that I may be less sorrowful
\add than I was\add*. 
\v 29-30 Welcome him very joyfully \add just like believers\add* in
\add our\add* Lord \add Jesus should welcome one another. While he
was\add* working for Christ, he was helping me in place of you \add because you were far
away\add*. He knew that he might die as a result of helping me, and
\add truly\add* he nearly did die. So honor \add him, and honor all\add* those who are like him.
