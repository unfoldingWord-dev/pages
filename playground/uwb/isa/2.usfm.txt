\c 2  
\s A message about future peace in Judah 
\p
\v 1 This is the message that \add Yahweh showed me in a vision\add*, concerning Jerusalem and the rest of Judea.
\q
\v 2  \add I saw that\add* in the future, the hill on which Yahweh's temple is built
\q2 will be the most important place on the earth; 
\q2 it will be \add as though it is\add* the highest mountain, 
\q \add as though\add* it has been raised up above all other hills;
\q2 and people from all over the world will come there. 
\b
\p
\v 3 People from many people-groups will say \add to each other\add*,
\q “Come, let's go up to the hill, 
\q2 to the temple of Yahweh, 
\q2 to worship the God whom Jacob \add worshiped\add*. 
\q There he will teach us what he \add desires us to know\add*, 
\q2 in order that our behavior will \add please\add* him. 
\q His teaching will be given to us in Jerusalem, 
\q2 and \add we will take\add* his message from Jerusalem \add to other
places\f + \ft Or: nations \f*\add*. 
\q
\v 4 Yahweh will listen to the disputes between nations 
\q2 and he will settle their arguments. 
\q Then, \add instead of fighting against each other\add*, they will hammer their swords into plow blades,
\q2 and they will hammer their spears into pruning knives. 
\q \add The armies of\add* nations will no longer fight against each other,
\q2 and they will not even train men to fight in battles\f + \ft Or: wars \f*.” 
\b
\q
\v 5 You Israeli people, 
\q2 let's walk in the light \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* that comes from Yahweh! 
\s A warning about the coming judgment 
\q
\v 6 Yahweh, you have abandoned us your people 
\q2 who are descendants of Jacob, 
\q because everywhere your people practice the customs of people who live east
\add of Israel\add*. 
\q2 They also perform rituals to find out what will happen in the future, like the people in Philistia do.
\q2 They make agreements\f + \ft Or: treaties \f* with ◄pagans\f + \ft Or: people \f* who do not know you►.
\q
\v 7 Israel is full of silver and gold; 
\q2 there are very many ◄treasures\f + \ft Or: valuable \f* things► here. 
\q The land is full of war horses 
\q2 and war chariots. 
\q
\v 8 But the land is also full of idols; 
\q2 the people worship things that they have made with their own hands.
\q
\v 9 So now they will be humbled 
\q2 and they will be caused to become disgraced— 
\q2 Yahweh, do not forgive them! 
\b
\q
\v 10 All you people should crawl into \add the caves in\add* the rock cliffs!
\q2 You should hide \add in pits\f + \ft Or: holes \f*\add* in the ground 
\q2 because of being afraid of Yahweh 
\q2 and of his glorious and awesome power. 
\q
\v 11 Yahweh will cause you people to no longer be arrogant 
\q2 and he will stop you from being proud. 
\q Only Yahweh will be praised\f + \ft Or: honored \f* on that day. 
\b
\q
\v 12 The Almighty Commander of the armies of angels has chosen a day
\q2 when \add he will judge\add* those who are proud, every one of them \\f + \\ft doublet \\f*,
\q2 and he will humble them. 
\q
\v 13  \add He will get rid of all those who think they should be admired
like\add* \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* the tall cedar trees in Lebanon, 
\q2 and \add like\add* all the great oak trees in the Bashan \add region\add*.
\q
\v 14 He will \add get rid of all those who think they are as great
as\add* \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* all the high hills 
\q2 and even the high mountains. 
\q
\v 15 He will \add get rid of all those who think that they are\add* high towers
\q2 and high strong walls \add inside of which they are safe\add*.
\q
\v 16 He will destroy all \add those who are rich because they own\add* big ships that carry goods
\add to other countries\add* 
\q2 and \add they own\add* other beautiful ships. 
\q
\v 17 He will cause people to no longer be arrogant 
\q2 and he will cause them to stop being proud. 
\q2 Only Yahweh will be praised\f + \ft Or: honored \f* on that day. 
\q2
\v 18 All idols will ◄disappear\f + \ft Or: be \f* destroyed►. 
\q
\v 19 When Yahweh comes to shake\f + \ft Or: terrify \f* the people on the earth,
\q2 they will run to hide in caves in rock cliffs 
\q and in holes\f + \ft Or: pits \f* in the ground, 
\q2 because of being afraid of Yahweh 
\q2 and of his glorious and awesome power. 
\q
\v 20 On that day, people will get rid of all their gold and silver idols
\q2 that they made to worship, 
\q and they will throw them to the bats and rats. 
\q
\v 21 Then they will crawl into caves 
\q2 and hide in the crags in the cliffs. 
\q \add They will do that to escape from\add* the dreadful \add punishments\add* that Yahweh will bring,
\q2 from \add what he will do because\add* he is glorious and awesome,
\q2 when he come to come to shake\f + \ft Or: terrify \f* the people on the earth.
\b
\q
\v 22 So, do not trust that people \add will save you\add*, 
\q2 because they are \add as powerless as\add* \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* a person's breath.
\q People certainly cannot help you \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f*!
