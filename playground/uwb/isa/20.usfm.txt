\s A message about Egypt and Ethiopia 
\p
\v 1 One year King Sargon of Assyria sent the chief commander of his army
\add to take his soldiers\add* to capture Ashdod \add city in Philistia\add*. At that time,
\v 2 Yahweh told me, “Take off the rough sackcloth that you have been wearing and take off your sandals.” So I did what he told
me to do, and then I walked around naked and barefoot \add for three
years\add*. 
\p
\v 3 Then Yahweh said this \add to the people of Judah\add*: “My servant Isaiah has been walking around naked and barefoot for
the past three years. That is to show the terrible disasters that
\add I will cause the people of\add* Egypt and Ethiopia to experience.
\v 4 What will happen is that the \add army of the\add* king of Assyria will
\add invade those countries and capture many of the people and\add* take them away as their prisoners. They will force all
them, including both the young ones and the old ones, to walk naked and barefoot. They will also force them to have no clothes
around their buttocks, which will cause the people of Egypt to be ashamed.
\v 5 Then the people of other countries who trusted that the armies of Egypt and Ethiopia would be able to help them will be
very dismayed/confused and afraid/disappointed. 
\v 6 They will say, ‘We relied that the armies of Egypt and Ethiopia
\add would help us and defend us, but they have been destroyed\add*, so there is no way \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* that we can escape from
\add being destroyed by the army of\add* the king of Assyria!’ ”
