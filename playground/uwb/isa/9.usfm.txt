\c 9  
\s The promise of the future king 
\p
\v 1 However, those in Judah who were distressed\f + \ft Or: worried \f* will not continue to suffer. Previously, Yahweh humbled the people in
the land where the tribes of Zebulun and Naphtali live. But in the future he will honor the people who live in the Galilee
region, along the road between the Jordan \add River\add* and the
\add Mediterranean\add* Sea, where many foreigners live. 
\q
\v 2 Some day, \add it will be as though\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* the people who walked in darkness will see a great light.
\q2 A great light will shine on those who live in a land where they have great troubles\f + \ft Or: distress \f*.
\q
\v 3  \add Yahweh\add*, you will cause us people in Israel to rejoice;
\q2 we will become very happy. 
\q We will rejoice about what you \add have done\add* 
\q2 like \f + \ft simile \f* people rejoice when they harvest their crops, 
\q or like soldiers rejoice 
\q2 when they divide up among themselves the things that they have captured in a battle.
\q
\v 4 You will cause us to no longer be slaves \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add of those who captured
us\add*; 
\q2 you will lift the heavy burdens from our shoulders. 
\q \add It will be as though\add* you will break the rods of those who oppressed us,
\q2 like you did when you destroyed \add the army of\add* the Midian people-group.
\q
\v 5 The boots that the enemy soldiers wore 
\q2 and their clothing which has stains of blood on them 
\q will all be burned up; 
\q2 they will only be fuel for a big fire. 
\q
\v 6 Another reason that we will rejoice is that a \add special\f + \ft Or: important \f*\add* child will be born for us,
\q2 \add a woman will give birth to\add* a son, 
\q2 and he will be our ruler. 
\q And his names will be 'Wonderful Counselor,' 'Mighty\f + \ft Or: Powerful \f* God,' 'Our Everlasting Father,' and 'King\f + \ft Or: Ruler \f* who causes us
to have Peace.' 
\q
\v 7 His rule, and the peace that he \add brings\f + \ft Or: causes \f*\add*, will never end.
\q2 He will rule \f + \ft metonymy \f* fairly and justly \f + \ft doublet \f*, 
\q like \add his ancestor King\add* David did. 
\q2 This will happen because the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels greatly desires that it happen.
\s God will punish Israel 
\q
\v 8 The Lord has warned the descendants of Jacob; 
\q2 he has said that \add he will punish\add* Israel. 
\q
\v 9-10 And all the people in Samaria and other places in Israel know that,
\q2 but they were very proud and arrogant \f + \ft doublet \f*. 
\q They said, “Our city has been destroyed, 
\q2 but we will take away the broken bricks from the ruins 
\q2 and replace them with carefully cut stones. 
\q Our sycamore-fig trees have been cut down \add by our enemies\add*,
\q2 but we will plant cedar trees \add in their place\add*.” 
\q
\v 11 But Yahweh brought the armies of \add Assyria\add*, the enemies of King Rezin
\add of Syria, to fight\add* against Israel 
\q2 and incited other nations \add to attack Israel\add*. 
\q
\v 12  \add The army of\add* Syria came from the east, 
\q2 and \add the army of\add* Philistia came from the west, 
\q and they destroyed Israel 
\q2 \add like a wild animal\add* \add tears another animal apart
and\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* devours it. 
\q But even after that happened, Yahweh was still very angry with them.
\q2 He was ready to strike them with his fist again. 
\b
\q
\v 13 But even though Yahweh punished his people like that, 
\q2 they still did not return to him \add and worship him\add*. 
\q They still did not request the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels,
\add to assist them\add*. 
\q
\v 14 Therefore, in one day Yahweh will get rid of \add those who are
like\add* Israel's head and \add those who are like\add* its tail;
\q2 the ones who are like the top of the palm tree and the ones who are like the bottom.
\q
\v 15 The leaders \f + \ft doublet \f* of Israel are the head, 
\q2 and the prophets who tell lies are the tail. 
\q
\v 16 The leaders of the people have misled them; 
\q2 they have caused the people that they are ruling to be confused.
\q
\v 17 For that reason, Yahweh is not pleased with the young men \add of
Israel\add*, 
\q2 and he does not even act mercifully toward the widows and orphans,
\q because they are all ungodly and wicked, 
\q2 and they all say things that are foolish. 
\q But Yahweh still is angry with them; 
\q2 he is ready to strike them with his fist again. 
\b
\q
\v 18 When people do wicked things, 
\q2 it is like \f + \ft simile \f* a brushfire \add that spreads rapidly\add*.
\q It burns up not only briers and thorns; 
\q it starts a big fire in the forests 
\q2 from which clouds of smoke will rise. 
\q
\v 19  \add It is as though\add* the whole land is burned black 
\q2 because the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels is extremely angry with the Israeli people.
\q They will become like \f + \ft simile \f* fuel for that great fire, 
\q2 and no one will try to rescue even his own brother \add from that
fire\add*. 
\q
\v 20 Israeli people will attack their neighbors \add who live in
houses\add* at the right \add to get food from them\add*, 
\q2 but they will still be hungry. 
\q They will \add kill and\add* eat the flesh of those \add who live in
houses\add* at the left, 
\q2 but their stomachs will still not be full. 
\q2
\v 21  \add People of the tribes of\add* Manasseh and Ephraim will attack each other,
\q2 and then they will both attack the people of Judah. 
\b
\q But even after that happens, Yahweh will still be very angry with them;
\q2 He will be ready to strike them with his fist again.
