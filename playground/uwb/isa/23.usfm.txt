\s A message about Tyre's punishment 
\p
\v 1  \add I received\add* this message \add from Yahweh\add* about Tyre
\add city\add*: 
\q You \add sailors on\add* \f + \fk apostrophe \f* ships from Tarshish, 
\q2 weep, because \add the harbor of\add* Tyre and all the houses
\add in the city\add* have been destroyed. 
\q2 The reports that you heard in Cyprus \add island\add* about Tyre
\add are true\add*. 
\b
\q
\v 2 You people who live along the coast \add near Tyre\add*, and merchants of Sidon
\add city\add*, mourn silently. 
\q2 Your sailors went across the seas \add to many places like Tyre\add*.
\q
\v 3 They sailed across deep seas 
\q2 to buy grain in Egypt 
\q and other crops that are grown along the Nile \add River\add*.
\q2 Tyre became the city where people from all nations bought and sold goods.
\b
\q
\v 4 But now you people in Sidon should be ashamed, 
\q2 because \add you trusted in Tyre\add*, which has been a strong fortress
\add on an island\add* in the sea. 
\q \add Tyre is like a woman who is saying\add*, 
\q2 “Now \add it is as though\add* I have not given birth to any children,
\q2 or raised any sons or daughters.” 
\b
\q
\v 5 When \add the people of\add* Egypt hear what has happened to Tyre,
\q2 they will grieve very much. 
\q
\v 6 Sail to Tarshish \add and tell them what happened\add*; 
\q2 weep, you people who live along the coast. 
\q
\v 7  \add The people in\add* the very old city \add of Tyre\add* were \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* previously joyful.
\q2 Traders \f + \fk personification \f* from Tyre established colonies in many distant nations.
\q
\v 8 People from Tyre appointed kings \add over other places\add*;
\q2 their traders were wealthy; 
\q they were \add as powerful and wealthy\add* as \f + \fk metaphor \f* kings. 
\q2 So, who \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* caused the people of Tyre to experience this disaster?
\q
\v 9 It was the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels who did it;
\q2 he did it in order to cause you people in Tyre to not be proud anymore,
\q2 to humiliate you men who are honored all over the world. 
\b
\q
\v 10 You people of Tarshish, you must grow crops in your land \add instead of
trading\add*; 
\q2 spread out over your land like \f + \fk simile \f* the Nile \add River\add* spreads over the land
\add of Egypt\add* when it floods, 
\q2 because there is no harbor \add in Tyre for your ships\add* now.
\q
\v 11  \add It is as though\add* Yahweh stretched out his hand over the sea
\q2 and shook the kingdoms of the earth. 
\q He commanded that in Phoenicia/Canaan 
\q2 all its fortresses must be destroyed. 
\q
\v 12 He said to the people of Sidon, 
\q2 “You will never rejoice again, because you will be crushed; 
\q even if you flee to Cyprus \add island\add*, 
\q2 you will not escape from troubles.” 
\b
\q
\v 13 Think about what happened in Babylonia: 
\q2 the people who were in that land have disappeared. 
\q \add The armies of\add* Assyria have caused that land to become a place where wild animals from the desert live.
\q They built dirt ramps to the top of the walls \add of the city of
Babylon\add*; 
\q2 then they \add entered the city and\add* tore down the palaces
\q2 and caused the city to become \add a heap of\add* rubble. 
\b
\q
\v 14 So wail, you \add sailors on the\add* ships of Tarshish, 
\q2 because the harbor \add in Tyre where your ships stop\add* is destroyed!
\p
\v 15 For seventy years, which is as long as kings usually live, people will forget about Tyre.
\add But then it will be rebuilt\add*. What will happen there will be like what happened to a prostitute in this song:
\q
\v 16 You harlot, whom people had forgotten, 
\q2 play your harp well, 
\q and sing many songs, 
\q2 in order that people will remember you again. 
\p
\v 17 It is true that after seventy years Yahweh will restore Tyre. Their merchants will again earn a lot of money by buying
things from and selling things to many other nations \f + \fk hyperbole \f*. 
\q
\v 18 But their profits will be given to Yahweh. 
\q2 \add The merchants\add* will not hoard their money; 
\q instead, they will give it to Yahweh's priests 
\q2 in order that they can buy food and nice clothes.
