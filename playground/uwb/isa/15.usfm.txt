\s Yahweh will destroy Moab 
\p
\v 1  \add I received\add* this message \add from Yahweh\add* about the Moab people-group:
\q In one night \add two important cities\add* in Moab, Ar and Kir, will be destroyed.
\q
\v 2 The people of Dibon, \add the capital city\add*, will go to their temple to mourn/weep;
\q2 they will go to their shrines on the hilltops to weep. 
\q They will wail because of \add what happened to\add* Nebo and Medeba
\add towns in the south\add*; 
\q2 they will all shave the hair of their heads, and the men will cut off their beards
\add to show that they are grieving\add*. 
\q
\v 3 In the streets people will wear rough sackcloth, 
\q2 and on their flat rooftops and in the city plazas all people will wail,
\q with tears streaming down their faces. 
\q
\v 4 The people of Heshbon \add city\add* and Elealeh \add towns in the north of
Moab\add* will cry out; 
\q2 people as far away as Jahaz \add town in the south\add* will hear them wailing.
\q Therefore the soldiers of Moab will tremble and cry out 
\q2 and they will be very afraid [IDI]. 
\b
\q
\v 5 I feel very sorry for \add the people of\add* Moab; 
\q2 they will flee to Zoar and Eglath-Shelishiyah \add towns in the far
south\add*. 
\q2 They will cry as they walk up to Luhith \add town\add*. 
\q All along the road to Horonaim \add town\add* people will mourn
\q2 because their country has been destroyed. 
\q
\v 6 The water in Nimrim \add valley\add* will have dried up. 
\q2 The grass there will be withered; 
\q the green plants will all be gone, 
\q2 and there will be nothing left that is green. 
\q
\v 7 The people will pick up their possessions 
\q2 and carry them across Willows Brook. 
\q
\v 8 Throughout the country of Moab, people will be crying; 
\q2 people as far away as Eglaim \add in the south\add* and Beer-Elim
\add in the north\add* will hear them wailing. 
\q
\v 9 The stream near Dibon will become red from the blood \add of people who have been
killed\add*, 
\q2 but I will cause the people of Moab to experience even more trouble:
\q lions will attack those who are trying to escape from Moab 
\q2 and will also attack the people who remain in that country.
