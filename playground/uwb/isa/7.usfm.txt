\c 7  
\s A message of encouragement for King Ahaz 
\p
\v 1 Ahaz, was the son of Jotham and grandson of Uzziah. During the time that Ahaz was the king of Judah, King Rezin of Syria
and King Pekah of Israel marched \add with their armies\add* to attack Jerusalem. But they could not conquer it.
\p
\v 2 But before they attacked, everyone in the palace heard a report that Syria and Israel were now allies\f + \ft Or: joined to attack
Jerusalem \f*. So Ahaz and the people over whom he ruled were extremely afraid; they were shaking like trees shake in a windstorm.
\p
\v 3 Then Yahweh said to me, "Take your son Shear-Jashub, and go to talk with King Ahaz. He is at the end of the
aqueduct\f + \ft Or: water channel \f* that brings water into the upper reservoir, near the road to the place where women wash clothes.
\v 4 Tell Ahaz to stop worrying \f + \ft doublet \f*. Tell him that he does not need to be afraid of those two kings, Rezin and Pekah. They
are very angry \add with Judah\add*, but they are \add unable to harm his country anymore
than\add* completely burned-out coals can harm him. 
\v 5 Yes, they are planning against him and saying, 
\v 6 'We will attack Judah and conquer it. Then we will appoint Tabeel's son to be the king of Judah.'
\v 7 But this is what Yahweh, the Lord, says: 
\q 'It will not happen; 
\q2 They will not \add conquer Jerusalem\add*! 
\q
\v 8 The capital of Syria is Damascus, 
\q2 but Damascus is ruled only by its \add unimportant\f + \ft Or: insignificant \f*\add* king Rezin.
\q And as for Israel, within sixty-five years it will be conquered and completely destroyed.
\q
\v 9 Israel's capital is Samaria, and Samaria is ruled only by its
\add insignificant\f + \ft Or: unimportant \f*\add* king Pekah. 
\q2 \add So you do not need to be afraid of those two countries\add*!
\q But you \add must trust me\add*, because if you do not trust me firmly,
\q2 you will be defeated.' " 
\s A promise of a son named Immanuel 
\p
\v 10 Later, Yahweh gave \add me another message to tell to\add* King Ahaz
\v 11 He said to tell him, "Request me, Yahweh your God, to do something that will enable you to be sure
\add that I will help\f + \ft Or: protect \f* you\add*. What you request can be \add in a place that
is\add* as high as the sky or as low as the place where the dead people are."
\p
\v 12 But \add when I told that to the king\add*, he refused. He said, "No, I will not request Yahweh to do something to prove
that he will help\f + \ft Or: protect \f* us." 
\p
\v 13 Then I said to him, "You people who are descendants of King David, listen! You are causing me to be tired of being
patient. Are you also going to cause my God to stop being patient with you \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*?
\v 14 Yahweh himself will do something for you \add to prove that he will help\f + \ft Or: protect \f*
you\add*. Listen to this: A young woman will become pregnant and give birth to a son. She will name him Immanuel,
\add which means 'God is with us'\add*. 
\v 15 And by the time that child is old enough to eat curds\f + \ft Or: yogurt \f* and honey, he will be able to reject what is evil and choose
what is good. 
\v 16 And before that child is old enough to do that, the lands of the two kings that you(sg) are very afraid of\f + \ft Or: worried
about \f* will be deserted. 
\v 17 But then Yahweh will cause you and your family and your entire nation to experience
\add terrible disasters\add*. Those disasters will be worse than any disasters that have occurred since the country of Israel
separated from Judah. Yahweh will cause \add the army of\add* the king of Assyria to attack you!"
\p
\v 18 At that time, \add it will be as though\add* Yahweh will whistle to summon the army from the south of Egypt as well as
the army of Assyria. They will \add come and surround your country
like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* flies and bees. 
\v 19 They will all come and settle\f + \ft Or: live \f* \add everywhere\add*—in the narrow valleys and caves in the rock cliffs, on land where
there are thornbushes as well as on the fertile land. 
\v 20 At that time Yahweh will hire the king of Assyria to come \add with his
army\add* from east of the \add Euphrates\add* River. \add They will get rid of everything in your land—the crops and the
people. They will destroy everything thoroughly\add*; it will be like \f + \ft metaphor \f* a barber shaving not only a man's hair but his
beard and the hair on his legs. 
\v 21 When that happens, a farmer will be able to have only one cow and two goats\f + \ft Or: sheep \f*.
\v 22 However, those animals will give plenty of milk, with the result that the farmer will have curds\f + \ft Or: yogurt \f* to eat. And
\add because there will not be many people left\add* in the land, all the people who remain there will have plenty of milk and
honey. 
\v 23 Now there are many areas where there are vineyards that are worth 1,000 pieces of silver, but at that time there will be
only briers and thorns \f + \ft doublet \f* in those fields. 
\v 24 There will be only briers and thorns in the entire land, \add and wild
animals\add*, with the result that men will take their bows and arrows and go there to hunt and kill animals.
\v 25 No one will go to where there previously were gardens on fertile hillsides, because briers and thorns will cover those
hillsides. They will be areas where \add only a few\add* cattle and sheep and goats wander around
\add searching for something to eat\add*.
