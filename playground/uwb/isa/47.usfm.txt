\c 47  
\s Prediction of the destruction of Babylon 
\q
\v 1  \add Yahweh also says\add*, "You people of Babylon, 
\q2 you should go and sit in the dust\f + \ft Or: dirt \f*, 
\q because your time to rule \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add other countries\add* is almost ended.
\q People will never again say that Babylonia is beautiful 
\q2 like a very attractive\f + \ft Or: beautiful \f* young woman. 
\q
\v 2  \add You will be slaves, so\add* take heavy stones 
\q2 and grind grain \add like slave women do\add*. 
\q Take off your \add beautiful\add* veils 
\q2 and take off your robes \add as you prepare to cross streams to go where you will be forced to
go\add*. 
\q
\v 3 You will be naked and very ashamed. 
\q2 I will get vengeance on you and not pity you." 
\b
\q
\v 4 The one who frees us \add people of Judah\add*, whom we call 'the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels,'
\q2 is the Holy One of Israel. 
\b
\q
\v 5  \add Yahweh says\add*, "You people of Babylon, 
\q2 sit silently in the darkness, 
\q because people will never again say that your city is like \f + \ft metaphor \f* a queen that rules many kingdoms.
\q
\v 6 I was angry with the people whom I chose \add to belong to me\add*,
\q2 and I punished them. 
\q I allowed you \add people of Babylon\add* to conquer them. 
\q But \add when you conquered them\add*, you did not act mercifully toward them.
\q2 You oppressed\f + \ft Or: treated cruelly \f* \f + \ft metaphor \f* even the old people. 
\q
\v 7 You said, 'We will rule \add other nations\add* forever; 
\q2 \add it is as though our city\add* will be the queen \add of the
world\add* forever!' 
\q But you did not think about the things \add that you were doing\add*,
\q2 or think about what would result. 
\b
\q
\v 8 You people \add of Babylon\add* who enjoy pleasure and sex,
\q2 listen to this: 
\q You enjoy a luxurious life and you feel secure. 
\q You say, 'We are \add like gods\add*, 
\q2 and there are no others like us. 
\q Our women will never become widows, 
\q2 and our children will never be killed \add in wars\add*.' 
\q
\v 9 But both of those things will happen to you suddenly: 
\q2 many of your women \bd will\bd* become widows 
\q2 and many of your children \bd will\bd* die, 
\q even though you perform much sorcery and many kinds of magic \add to prevent bad things from happening to
you\add*. 
\q
\v 10 You felt protected even though you were doing many wicked things,
\q2 and you said, 'No one will see what we \add are doing\add*!'
\q You \add thought that\add* you were very wise and knew many things,
\q2 and you said, 'We are gods, and there are no others like us,'
\q2 but you deceived yourselves. 
\q
\v 11 So you will experience terrible things, 
\q2 and you will not be able to prevent them by working magic. 
\q You will experience disasters, 
\q2 and you will not be able to pay anyone to prevent those things from happening.
\q A catastrophe\f + \ft Or: Something terrible \f* will happen to you suddenly,
\q2 something that you will not realize \add is about to happen\add*.
\b
\q
\v 12 So you can continue to perform all your magic spells \f + \ft irony \f*!
\q2 You can perform the many kinds of sorcery that you have practiced for many years!
\q Perhaps \add doing those things will enable you to\add* be successful;
\q2 perhaps you will be able to cause your enemies to be afraid of you!
\q
\v 13 But \add all that has resulted from your\add* doing all the things that the magicians have told you to do is that you
have become tired! 
\q The men who look at the stars every month and predict what will happen
\q2 should come forward and rescue you \add from the disasters that you are about to
experience\add*. 
\q
\v 14 But \add they cannot do that, because\add* they are like \f + \ft simile \f* straw that is burning in a fire;
\q2 they cannot save themselves from being burned up in the flames.
\q Those men are unable to help you \f + \ft metaphor \f*; 
\q2 they are as useless as stubble \add that burns quickly and produces no
heat\add* for you. 
\q
\v 15 The people whom you have associated with and worked with since you were young
\q2 \add will not help you\add*, 
\q because they will just continue doing their own foolish things,
\q and they will not pay any attention to you 
\q2 \add when you cry out for help\add*."
