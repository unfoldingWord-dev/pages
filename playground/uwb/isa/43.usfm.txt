\c 43  
\s Israel's only Savior 
\q
\v 1 But now, you people of Israel, listen to Yahweh, the one who established your nation.
\q2 The one who caused you to become a nation \\f + \\ft doublet \\f* says this: 
\q “Do not be afraid, 
\q2 because I previously rescued you. 
\q I enabled you to have a personal relationship with me \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f*, and you belong to me.
\q
\v 2 When you \add experience dangerous situations\add*, 
\q and \add you feel like\add* \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* you are crossing deep rivers,
\q2 I will be with you. 
\q When you have very big troubles\f + \ft Or: difficulties \f*, 
\q2 you will \\f + \\ft litotes \\f* be able to endure them. 
\q When \add people try to kill you like they tried to kill Daniel's three friends
by\add* throwing them in a fire, 
\q2 you will not \add die, just like Daniel's three friends were
not\add* burned up, 
\q
\v 3 because I am Yahweh, your God, 
\q2 the Holy One of Israel, the one who rescues you. 
\q I will enable \add the army of the emperor of Persia\add* to conquer Egypt instead of conquering you;
\q2 similarly I will enable them to conquer Ethiopia and Seba \add in
Arabia\add* in order that you can be saved. 
\q
\v 4 I will cause other countries to be conquered instead of your country;
\q2 I will trade them for you, 
\q2 in order that you will not be killed, 
\q because you are very precious \\f + \\ft doublet \\f* to me 
\q2 and because I love you. 
\q
\v 5 Do not be afraid, because I am with you. 
\q2 \add Some day\add* I will gather your descendants from the east and from the west.
\q
\v 6 I will command the \add rulers of the nations to\add* the north and to the south,
\q2 ‘Allow all the people of Israel to return \add to their country\add*,
\q2 from the most distant places on the earth. 
\q
\v 7 Allow all those who belong to me \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* to return, 
\q2 because I have caused them to become a nation in order that they would honor me;
\q2 I am the one who has done that \\f + \\ft doublet \\f*.’ 
\q
\v 8 Summon the people who have eyes but \add it is as though\add* they are blind;
\q2 summon those who have ears but \add because they do not listen to me, it is as
though\add* they are deaf. 
\q
\v 9 Gather people of all nations together, 
\q2 ones from all people-groups, 
\q \add and ask them this\add*: ‘Has any of their idols foretold the things that are happening now?
\q2 And can any of them predict what will happen in the future?’
\q Then bring people who will testify and say ‘I heard them predict things,
\q2 and what they predicted was what happened,’ 
\q2 \add but they will be lying\add*.” 
\q
\v 10 But Yahweh says, “You people of Israel ◄are my witnesses\f + \ft Or: know \f* what I have done►,
\q2 and you are the ones who serve me. 
\q I chose you in order that you would know me, believe in me, 
\q2 and understand that I am the only one who is \add truly\add* God.
\q There is no other \add true\add* God. 
\q2 There was no other \add true\add* God previously, 
\q2 and there will never be another \add true\add* God. 
\q
\v 11 I, only I, am Yahweh, 
\q2 and there is no other one who can save you. 
\q
\v 12 I said that I would rescue \add your ancestors\add*, 
\q2 and then I rescued them, and I proclaimed \add that I had done
it\add*. 
\q No foreign god among you did that! 
\q2 And you are witnesses that only I, Yahweh, am God. 
\q2
\v 13 I am God, the one who has existed forever and who will exist forever;
\q no one can snatch people from my hand, 
\q2 and no one can alter\f + \ft Or: change \f* what I have done.” 
\s God promises to rescue his people from Babylon 
\q
\v 14 Yahweh, the Holy One of Israel, is the one who rescues you; and this is what he says:
\q2 “For your sake, I will send \add an army\add* to \add attack\add* Babylon.
\q2 They will force the people of the city to flee in ships which they have been proud of.
\q
\v 15 I am Yahweh, your Holy One, 
\q2 the one who caused Israel to become a nation, and the one who is really your king.
\q
\v 16 I am Yahweh, the one who opened a path through the water, 
\q2 making a road through the Red Sea. 
\q
\v 17 Then I summoned the great army \add of Egypt\add* 
\q2 to come with all their chariots and horses. 
\q \add But when they tried to pursue my people\add*, 
\q I caused the waves to flow over them \add and they drowned\add*;
\q2 their lives ended \add like the light of a candle ends when someone\add* \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* snuffs out the wick.
\q
\v 18 But do not think \add only\add* about what happened in the past, long ago \\f + \\ft doublet \\f*.
\q
\v 19 Instead, consider the new thing that I am going to do. 
\q2 I have already started to do it; 
\q2 can you see it? 
\q I am going to make a road through the desert. 
\q2 And I will cause there to be streams in the wasteland\f + \ft Or: desert \f*.
\q
\v 20 The jackals\f + \ft Or: wolves \f* and owls and other wild creatures will thank me
\q2 for giving them water in the desert. 
\q I will cause streams to appear in the dry desert 
\q2 in order that my people, the ones whom I have chosen, will have water;
\q2
\v 21 I will do that for the people whom I have created \add and
chosen\add* to belong to me, 
\q2 and \add some day\add* they will cause many others to praise me.
\s God's grievances concerning Israel 
\q
\v 22 But now, you descendants of Jacob, you refuse to request my help.
\q2 It seems that you people of Israel have become tired of worshiping me.
\q
\v 23 You have not brought to me sheep or goats for offerings that will be completely burned
\add on the altar\add*; 
\q2 you have not honored me by \add bringing to me any\add* sacrifices,
\q even though the offerings of grain and incense \add that I asked
you\add* to bring to me were not a burden to you. 
\q
\v 24 You have bought for me fragrant reeds, 
\q2 and you have brought me the fat from your sacrifices. 
\q But these have not pleased me, 
\q2 because you have burdened me by all the sins that you have committed,
\q2 and made me weary because of all ◄your iniquities\f + \ft Or: the \f* wrong things that you have done►.
\b
\q
\v 25 I am the one who is able to forgive you for all your sins;
\q2 I am the only one who can do that, 
\q2 with the result that I will never think about them again. 
\q
\v 26 Tell me what I have done that you do not like. 
\q2 Do you think that when you state your case, you will prove that you ◄are innocent\f + \ft Or: have \f* done nothing wrong► \\f + \\ft irony \\f*?
\q
\v 27 No, \add what has happened is that\add* the first ancestor of you Israelis' sinned
\add against me\add*, 
\q2 and since then, all your leaders have rebelled against me. 
\q
\v 28 That is why I have caused your priests to be disgraced; 
\q2 and I have allowed others to destroy you people of Israel 
\q2 and caused you to be despised.”
