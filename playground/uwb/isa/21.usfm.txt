\s A message about the destruction of Babylon 
\p
\v 1  \add I received\add* this message \add from Yahweh about Babylonia\add*,
\add a land that is\add* near the \add Persian\add* Gulf \add but which will soon
be\add* a desert. 
\q \add An army\add* will soon come from the desert to invade that land;
\q2 they are an army that causes their enemies to be terrified, 
\q2 an army that will come like a whirlwind from the south. 
\b
\q
\v 2 Yahweh showed me a terrifying vision: 
\q \add in the vision I saw an army\add* 
\q2 that will betray/deceive people and steal their possessions \add after they conquer
them\add*. 
\q \add Yahweh said\add*, “You armies from Elam and Media, surround
\add Babylon\add* and prepare to attack it! 
\q2 I will cause the groaning \add and suffering\add* that Babylon caused to cease!”
\b
\q
\v 3 Because of that, my body is full of pain; 
\q2 my pain is like the pain that women who are giving birth experience.
\q When I hear about and see \add what God is planning to do\add*,
\q2 I am shocked. 
\q
\v 4 I cannot think straight/correctly, and I tremble. 
\q2 I was eager for it to be nighttime, 
\q2 but now it is night, and I am horrified. 
\b
\q
\v 5  \add In the vision I saw that the leaders of Babylonia\add* were preparing a great feast.
\q2 They had spread rugs \add for people to sit on\add*; 
\q2 everyone was eating and drinking. 
\q But they should get up and prepare their shields, 
\q2 because they are about to be attacked! 
\p
\v 6 Then Yahweh said to me, 
\q “Put a watchman \add on the wall of Jerusalem\add*, 
\q2 and tell him to shout/proclaim what he sees. 
\q
\v 7 Tell him to watch for chariots pulled by pairs of horses, 
\q2 and \add men riding\add* camels and donkeys, \add coming from
Babylon\add*. 
\q Tell the watchman to watch and listen carefully!” 
\p
\v 8  \add So I did that\add*, and one day the watchman called out,
\q “Day after day I have stood on this watchtower, 
\q2 and I have continued to watch during the day and during the night.
\q
\v 9 Now, I saw a man riding in a chariot pulled by two horses. 
\q2 \add I called out to him\add*, and he answered/shouted, 
\q ‘Babylon has been destroyed! 
\q2 All the idols in Babylon lie in pieces on the ground!’ ” 
\b
\q
\v 10 My people \add in Judah\add*, \add the army of Babylon has
caused\add* you to suffer greatly 
\q2 as though \f + \fr metaphor \f* you were grain that was threshed and ◄winnowed/thrown up into the air for the wind to blow away the chaff►.
\q But now I have told you what the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels the God whom we Israelis
\add worship\add*, told me \add about Babylon\add*. 
\s A message about Edom 
\p
\v 11  \add I received\add* this message \add from Yahweh\add* about Edom:
\q Someone from Edom has been calling/shouting to me saying, 
\q2 “Watchman, how long will it be before the night is ended? \f + \fr doublet \f*”
\q
\v 12 I, the watchman, replied, 
\q2 “It will soon be morning, but after that, it will soon be night again.
\q If you want to inquire again \add about what will happen in our
country\add*, 
\q2 come back and inquire again.” 
\s A message about Arabia 
\p
\v 13  \add I received\add* this message about Arabia: 
\q Give this message to people traveling in caravans from Dedan \add town in northwest
Arabia\add*, who camp in the scrub there. 
\q Tell them to bring water for those who are thirsty. 
\q2
\v 14 And you people who live in Tema \add city in northwest Arabia\add*,
\q2 must bring food for the ◄refugees/people who are fleeing from their enemies►.
\q
\v 15 They are fleeing in order not to be killed by their enemies' swords
\q2 and not to be shot in battles by arrows. 
\b
\p
\v 16 Yahweh said to me, 
\q “Exactly one year from now, 
\q2 all the greatness of the Kedar \add area in Arabia\add* will end.
\q
\v 17 Only a few of their soldiers who are know well how to shoot arrows will remain alive.
\q \add That will surely happen because\add* I, Yahweh, have said it.”
