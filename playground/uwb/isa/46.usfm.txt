\c 46  
\s The gods of Babylonia are useless 
\q
\v 1  \add It is as though\add* Bel and Nebo, the statues of the gods
\add of Babylonia\add*, 
\q2 are bowing down as they are put on animals and carried away!
\q The statues are heavy burdens and will cause the animals to become tired \f + \ft sarcasm \f*!
\q
\v 2  \add It seems like\add* both gods are bowing down; 
\q2 not only can they not save themselves, 
\q2 but they themselves are being exiled\f + \ft Or: taken to another country \f*!
\b
\q
\v 3  \add Yahweh says\add*, "You descendants of Jacob who were exiled,
\q \add I am not like the gods of Babylonia that must be carried\add*;
\q2 \add instead, it is as though\add* I have carried you 
\q since you first became a nation \f + \ft metaphor \f*. 
\q2 I carried you even before you became a nation. 
\q
\v 4 I will be your God, and I will carry you for many years, 
\q2 until \add it is as though\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* your nation is an old man with gray hair.
\q I caused \add you to become a nation\add*, 
\q2 and I will sustain you and rescue you. 
\b
\q
\v 5 There is certainly \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* no one to whom I can be compared. 
\q2 There is \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* no one who is equal to me \f + \ft doublet \f*. 
\q
\v 6  \add So it is stupid\f + \ft Or: ridiculous \f* that\add* some people pour out gold and silver from their bags
\q2 and weigh it on a scale. 
\q Then they hire a man who makes things from gold to make an idol from it.
\q2 \add After he makes an idol\add*, they bow down and worship it!
\q
\v 7 They lift it up and carry it on their shoulders. 
\q2 They put it in a \add special\add* place, 
\q2 and it stays there. 
\q It cannot move! 
\q And when someone prays to it, it does not answer. 
\q2 So \add obviously\add* it cannot rescue anyone from his troubles!
\b
\q
\v 8  \add You people of Judah\add*, do not forget this; 
\q2 keep thinking about it, you sinful people! 
\q
\v 9 Think about the things that \add I did\add* long ago. 
\q2 Only I am God; I am God, and there is no one like me. 
\q
\v 10 Only I can tell what will happen in the future before it occurs;
\q2 I tell it long before it happens. 
\q I will accomplish everything that I plan to accomplish, 
\q2 and I will do everything that I want to do. 
\q
\v 11 So I will summon \add Cyrus\f + \ft Or: someone \f* to come\add* from the east
\add like a swift and powerful\add* eagle; 
\q2 he will come from a distant country. 
\q He will accomplish what I want him to. 
\q2 \add He is the one who\add* will do what I have said that I want him to do,
\q2 what I have planned. 
\q
\v 12 You stubborn people of Israel, 
\q2 \add you think that\add* it will be a long time before you are allowed to return to your own country.
\q
\v 13 But I will rescue you, 
\q2 and it will not be a long time \add before that happens\add*.
\q2 I will do it soon. 
\q I will rescue Jerusalem 
\q2 and show to you Israeli people that I am glorious."
