\s Hezekiah's sickness and his recovery 
\p
\v 1 About that time, Hezekiah became very ill and was close to dying. So I went to see him. And I gave him this message: “This
is what Yahweh says: ‘You should tell the people in your palace what you want them to do after you die because you will not
recover from this illness. You are going to die’ ” 
\p
\v 2 Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall, and prayed this: 
\v 3 “Yahweh, do not forget that I have always served you faithfully with all my inner being, and I have done things that
pleased you!” Then Hezekiah started to cry loudly. 
\p
\v 4  \add I left his room, but\add* Yahweh gave me this message:
\v 5 “Go back to Hezekiah and tell him that this is what I, the God to whom your ancestor King David belonged, say: ‘I have
heard what you prayed, and I have seen you crying. So listen: I will enable you to live fifteen years more.
\v 6 And, I will rescue and this city from the power \f + \fk metonymy \f* of the king of Assyria. I will defend this city.
\p
\v 7 And this is what I will do to prove that I will do what I have just now promised. I will cause the shadow of the sun to
move ten steps backward on the sundial that was built by King Ahaz.’ ”
\v 8 So the shadow of the sun on the sundial moved backward ten steps.
\p
\v 9 When King Hezekiah was almost well again, he wrote this: 
\q
\v 10 I said to myself, “Is it necessary for me to die and go to the place where the dead people are
\q2 during this time of my life when I am still strong? 
\q2 Is Yahweh going to rob me of the remaining years that I \add should
live\add*?” 
\q
\v 11 I said, “I will not see Yahweh again 
\q2 in this world where people are alive. 
\q I will not see my friends again, 
\q2 or be with others who now are alive in this world. 
\q
\v 12  \add It is as if\add* my life has been taken away 
\q2 like \f + \fk simile \f* a tent \add whose pegs\add* have been pulled up by a shepherd and taken away.
\q My time to live has been cut short, 
\q2 like a piece of cloth that a weaver \add cuts and\add* rolls up
\add after he has finished weaving a cloth\add*.” 
\q2 Suddenly, \add it seemed that\add* my life was ending. 
\q
\v 13 I waited patiently all during the night, 
\q2 but \add my pain was as though\add* \f + \fk metaphor \f* I was being torn apart by lions.
\q2 \add It seemed that\add* my life was finished. 
\q
\v 14  \add I was delirious, and\add* I chirped like a swift or a swallow,
\q2 and moaned like a dove. 
\q My eyes became tired looking up toward heaven for help. 
\q2 I cried out, ‘Yahweh, help me, because I am distressed!’ 
\b
\q
\v 15 But there was really nothing\f + \fk rhetorical question \f* that I could say and ask him to reply to me,
\q2 because it was Yahweh who sent this illness. 
\q So now I will live humbly during my \add remaining\add* years
\q2 because I am very anguished in my soul. 
\q
\v 16 Yahweh, the sufferings \f + \ft (OR, the promises) \f* that you give are good,
\q2 because what you do and what you say bring new life and health to us.
\q And you have restored/healed me 
\q2 and allowed me to continue to live! 
\q
\v 17 Truly, my suffering was good for me; 
\q2 you loved me, 
\q and as a result you have rescued me from dying 
\q2 and have also forgiven all my sins. 
\q
\v 18 Dead people \f + \fk metonymy \f* cannot praise you; 
\q2 they cannot sing to praise you. 
\q Those who have descended to their graves 
\q2 cannot confidently expect you to faithfully \add do things for
them\add*. 
\q
\v 19 Only people who are still alive, like I am, can praise you.
\q Fathers tell their children how you are faithful, 
\q2 \add and if I remain alive, I will do the same thing\add*. 
\b
\q
\v 20  \add I know that\add* Yahweh will fully heal me, 
\q2 so I will sing to praise him 
\q while others praise him playing musical instruments; 
\q2 I will do that every day of my life, in the temple of Yahweh.”
\p
\v 21 I had previously said to Hezekiah's servants, “Prepare an ointment from
\add mashed\add* figs, and spread it on his boil, and then he will recover.”
\add So they did that, and Hezekiah recovered\add*. 
\p
\v 22 And Hezekiah had previously asked, “What will Yahweh do to prove that I will
\add recover and be able to\add* go to his temple?”
