\v 1 ◄Who will believe what we will tell them \add about God's servant\add*?\f + \ft Or: Hardly \f* anyone will believe what we will tell them
\add about God's servant\add*.► \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* 
\q2 Who will see what Yahweh does by his great power?\f + \ft Or: Very few people will see what Yahweh does by his great power. \f* [MTY,
RHQ] 
\q
\v 2 While God watches, his servant will grow up appearing\f + \ft Or: seeming \f*
\add to be very insignificant\f + \ft Or: unimportant \f*\add*, 
\q2 like a weak young plant that shoots up from a root \add of a tree that is
growing\add* in dry ground. 
\q There will be nothing beautiful or majestic about him, 
\q2 nothing that would cause us to want to be with him. 
\q
\v 3 People will despise and reject him. {He will be despised and rejected.}
\q He will endure much pain, and he will suffer much. 
\q2 \add Because his face will be very disfigured\add*, people will not
\add want to\add* look at him; 
\q people will despise him and think that he is not worth paying any attention to.
\b
\q
\v 4 But he will be \add punished for\add* the sicknesses \add of our
souls\add*; 
\q2 he will endure great pain for us. 
\q But we will think that he is being punished by God, 
\q2 afflicted\f + \ft Or: punished \f* \add for his own sins\add*. 
\q
\v 5 But his body will be bruised because of the evil things that we did;
\q he will be wounded because of our sins. 
\q2 He will be beaten in order that things will go well for our \add souls\add*;
\q and because he will be whipped, \add our souls\add* can be healed.
\q
\v 6 All of us have gone away \add from God\add* like \f + \ft simile \f* sheep who have strayed away
\add from their shepherd\add*. 
\q2 We have turned away \add from doing the things that God wants in
order\add* to do the things that we want \f + \ft metaphor \f*. 
\q We \add deserve to be punished\add*, but Yahweh will punish him instead of punishing us for all of our sins.
\q
\v 7 He will be abused and caused to suffer, 
\q2 but he will not say anything \add to complain\add*. 
\q They will lead him to \add where they will execute him\add*, 
\q2 \add like they lead\add* a lamb to where it will be slaughtered.
\q And like a sheep does not bleat\f + \ft Or: make any noise \f* when the shearer
\add cuts off its wool\add*, 
\q2 he will not say anything \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add to defend himself when he is
killed\add*. 
\q
\v 8 After he is arrested and put on trial, 
\q2 he will be taken away \add and executed\add*. 
\q And no one \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* will be able to talk about his descendants, 
\q2 because he will die \f + \ft euphemism \f* \add without being married and having
children\add*; 
\q2 he will be afflicted\f + \ft Or: caused to suffer \f* for the wrong things that we have done.
\q
\v 9 Although he will never have done any wrong or deceived \f + \ft metonymy \f* anyone,
\q2 people will plan to bury his corpse where wicked people are buried,
\q but instead, a rich man will \add bury him\add* after he dies.
\b
\q
\v 10 But it will be Yahweh's will that he be afflicted and caused to suffer.
\q2 And \add when he dies\add*, Yahweh will cause him to be an offering to remove the gullt of sinners.
\q But later he will have many \add spiritual\add* children, 
\q2 and he will live a long time\f + \ft Or: forever \f* after he \add dies and\add* becomes alive
\add again\add*, 
\q2 and he \f + \ft metonymy \f* will accomplish everything that Yahweh has planned.
\q2
\v 11 When he sees all that he will accomplish because of his suffering,
\q he will be satisfied. 
\q2 And because of what will have happened to him, 
\q Yahweh's righteous servant will cause the guilt of many people to be ended,
\q2 because he will remove \add the guilt for\add* their sins. 
\q
\v 12 So Yahweh will consider him to be one of the truly great people;
\q2 he will \add be like a king who\add* divides up \add among his
soldiers\add* the spoils\f + \ft Or: things they took from their enemies after defeating them \f* \f + \ft metaphor \f*,
\q because he will sacrifice himself and die. 
\q2 \add Even though people\add* will consider him to be a sinner,
\q he will remove the guilt of many people, 
\q2 and he will intercede\f + \ft Or: pray \f* for those who have done things that are wrong.
