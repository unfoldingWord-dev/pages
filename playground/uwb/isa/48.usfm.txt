\c 48  
\s The people of Israel are stubborn 
\q
\v 1  \add Yahweh says\add*, “You descendants \f + \fk metonymy \f* of Jacob, 
\q2 who are also descendants of Judah and are now called \add the people
of\add* Israel, 
\q2 Listen to me! 
\q You make solemn promises using my name, Yahweh, 
\q2 and you request that I, the God to whom you Israeli people belong,
\add will hear you\add*, 
\q2 but you do not do it sincerely. 
\q
\v 2 You say that you live in the holy city \add of Jerusalem\add*
\q2 and \add you insincerely say\add* that you are relying on me, the God to whom you people of Israel belong,
\q2 the one who is the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels.
\q
\v 3 Long ago I \f + \fk metonymy \f* predicted what would happen \f + \fk doublet \f*. 
\q2 And then suddenly, I caused those things to happen. 
\q
\v 4 I knew that you people are very stubborn; 
\q2 I knew that your heads are \f + \fk metaphor \f* as hard as iron or brass \f + \fk doublet \f*.
\q
\v 5 That is why I told you those things long ago. 
\q2 Long before they occurred, I announced that they would occur,
\q in order that \add when they happened\add* you could not say 
\q2 ‘Our idols did it; 
\q2 our statue made of wood and our idol made of metal caused them to happen.’
\q
\v 6 You have heard those things \add that I predicted\add* 
\q2 and now you have seen that they have all occurred, 
\q so why do you not admit it \f + \fk rhetorical question \f*? 
\b
\q Now I will tell you new things, 
\q2 things that you have not known previously. 
\q
\v 7 I am causing them to happen now; 
\q2 they are not things I did long ago. 
\q So you cannot say, ‘We already knew about those things.’ 
\q
\v 8  \add I will tell you about\add* things that you have never heard about or understood before.
\q2 Even long ago you did not pay attention to me [IDI]. 
\q I know that you act very deceitfully/treacherously; 
\q2 you have rebelled against me since you first became a nation \f + \fk metonymy \f*.
\q
\v 9 But, for my own sake, in order that I will be honored, 
\q2 I will not punish \f + \fk metonymy \f* you immediately 
\q2 and I will not completely get rid of you. 
\q
\v 10 I have purified you, but not the way \add people refine\add* silver.
\q Instead, I have caused you to suffer very much \add to get rid of your impure
behavior\add* 
\q2 like \f + \fk metaphor \f* \add people put metal in a very hot\add* furnace \add to get rid of the
impurities\add*. 
\q
\v 11 But for my \f + \fk metonymy \f* own sake I will delay punishing you more;
\q I will do it for my own sake 
\q2 in order that my reputation will not be damaged \f + \fk rhetorical question \f*. 
\q I will not allow any \add person or any idol\add* to be honored as I
\add deserve to be\add* honored.” 
\s The people of Israel should leave Babylon because that city will be destroyed
\q
\v 12 “You descendants \f + \fk metonymy \f* of Jacob, you people of Israel whom I have chosen,
\q2 listen to me! 
\q Only I am God; 
\q2 I am the one who begins everything and who causes everything to end.
\q
\v 13 I \f + \fk synecdoche \f* am the one who laid the foundation of he earth. 
\q2 I stretched out the sky with my hand. 
\q And when I tell \add the stars\add* to appear, 
\q2 they all do what I tell them. 
\b
\q
\v 14 All of you, gather together and listen to me. 
\q2 None of your idols have \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* told this to you: 
\q I, Yahweh, have chosen \add Cyrus\add* to assist me, 
\q2 and he will do to Babylon what I want him to do, 
\q2 and his army will get rid of the army of Babylonia. 
\q
\v 15 I have said it; 
\q2 I have summoned \add Cyrus\add*. 
\q I have appointed him, 
\q2 and he will accomplish everything that he attempts to do. 
\b
\p
\v 16 Come close to me and listen to what I say. 
\q Long ago \f + \fk metonymy \f* I told you plainly/clearly \f + \fk litotes \f* \add what would
happen\add*, 
\q2 and when those things occurred, I was \add causing them to happen\add*.”
\b
\q And now Yahweh the Lord and his Spirit have sent me \add to give you a
message\add*. 
\q
\v 17 This is what Yahweh, the one who saves you, the Holy God of us Israelis, says:
\q2 “I am Yahweh, your God; 
\q I teach you what is important for you \add to know\add*; 
\q2 I direct you and lead you to the roads that you should walk on \f + \fk metaphor \f*.
\q
\v 18 I wish that you had paid attention to my commands! 
\q2 If you had done that, things would have gone well for you 
\q2 like \f + \fk simile \f* a river that flows gently; 
\q you would have been successful again and again, 
\q2 like \f + \fk simile \f* waves that come without ceasing. 
\q
\v 19 Your descendants would have been \add as many as\add* \f + \fk metaphor \f* the grains of sand
\add on the seashore\add* 
\q2 \add which no one can count\add*. 
\q I would not have needed to get rid of them; 
\q2 the country of \f + \fk metonymy \f* Israel would not have been destroyed.” 
\b
\q
\v 20  \add However, now I tell you\add*, 
\q2 leave Babylon! 
\q Flee from \add being slaves of the people of\add* Babylonia! 
\q Proclaim this message joyfully; 
\q2 send it to the most remote/distant places on the earth: 
\q Yahweh, freed \add the people of Israel from being slaves in Egypt\add*.
\q2
\v 21 They were not thirsty when he led them through the desert,
\q because he split open the rock 
\q2 and caused water to gush/flow out for them \add to drink\add*.
\b
\q
\v 22 “But things will not go well \add like that\add* for wicked people,” says Yahweh.
