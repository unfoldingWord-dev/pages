\c 50  
\s Yahweh's power 
\p
\v 1 This is also what Yahweh says: 
\q “You \add Israeli children\add*, do not think \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* that I \add forced your parents to be exiled/taken to
Babylonia\add* \f + \fk metaphor \f* 
\q2 like some men send away their wives 
\q after giving them a paper 
\q2 on which they state that they were divorcing them! 
\q I certainly did not \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* get rid of you like a man who sells his children to get money to pay what he owes.
\q No, the reason that I forced you to be exiled 
\q2 \add was to punish you\add* because of the sins that you have committed \f + \fk doublet \f*.
\q
\v 2 When I came to you \add to rescue you\add*, 
\q2 why did no one answer when I called out to you \f + \fk rhetorical question \f*? 
\q Was there no one there \f + \fk rhetorical question \f*? 
\q2 Or, did you think that I do not have the power \f + \fk metonymy \f* to rescue you \f + \fk doublet \f*?
\q Think about this: 
\q2 I can speak to a sea and cause it to become dry! 
\q I can cause rivers to become deserts 
\q2 with the result that the fish in the rivers die from thirst and rot.
\q
\v 3 I cause the sky to become dark, 
\q2 as though \f + \fk metaphor \f* it was wearing black clothes because it was mourning
\add because someone had died\add*.” 
\b
\q
\v 4 Yahweh our God has given me his wise message \f + \fk metonymy \f* 
\q2 in order that I may encourage those who are weary. 
\q Each morning he awakens me, 
\q2 in order that I \f + \fk synecdoche \f* may listen to what he teaches \f + \fk simile \f* me.
\q
\v 5 Yahweh our God has spoken to me [IDI], 
\q2 and I have not rejected what he told me; 
\q2 I have accepted \f + \fk litotes \f* it. 
\q
\v 6 I allowed people to beat me on my back 
\q2 and to pull out the whiskers in my beard \add because they hated
me\add*. 
\q I did not turn away \f + \fk metonymy \f* from them 
\q2 when they made fun of me and spat on me. 
\q
\v 7 But, because the Lord our God helps me, 
\q2 I will never be humiliated. 
\q Therefore, I am strongly determined [IDI] to face/endure difficulties,
\q2 and I know that nothing will cause me to be ashamed. 
\q
\v 8 God, the one who vindicates me, is near to me; 
\q2 so if anyone \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* stands in front of me and accuses me in a court,
\q2 he will not be able \add to show that I have done anything that is
wrong\add*. 
\q
\v 9 The Lord our God defends me \add in court\add*, 
\q2 so no one \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* will be able to ◄condemn me/declare that I am guilty►.
\q All those who accuse me will disappear 
\q2 like \f + \fk simile \f* old clothes that have been eaten by ◄\add larvae of\add* moths/cockroaches►.
\b
\q
\v 10 If you revere Yahweh 
\q2 and do what his servant tells you to do, 
\q even if you are ◄walking in darkness/enduring suffering►, and it seems that \f + \fk metaphor \f* there is no light,
\q2 trust in Yahweh your God \f + \fk doublet \f* \add to help you\add*. 
\q
\v 11 But you people who \add oppose me\add*, 
\q2 \add who would like to throw\add* me into a blazing fire, 
\q walk in your own fires 
\q2 and burn yourselves with your own torches! 
\q This is what Yahweh will cause to happen to you: 
\q2 you will be enduring great torment when you die \f + \fk euphemism \f*!
