\c 49  
\s Yahweh appointed his special servant 
\q
\v 1 All you people who live on islands \add in the ocean\add* and in other distant areas,
\q2 pay attention \f + \ft doublet \f* to what I will say! 
\q Yahweh called\f + \ft Or: chose \f* me before was born; 
\q2 he chose\f + \ft Or: appointed \f* me when I was still in my mother's womb. 
\q
\v 2  \add When I grew up\add*, he caused my messages to be like \f + \ft simile \f* a sharp sword.
\q He has protected me by his hand \f + \ft synecdoche \f*. 
\q2 \add He protects me\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* like someone protects sharp arrows in a quiver.
\q
\v 3 He said to me, “You will serve my Israeli people, 
\q2 and you will cause people to honor me.” 
\q
\v 4 I replied, “My work has been useless; 
\q2 I have used my strength, but I have accomplished nothing worthwhile;
\q2 everything that I have done has been in vain\f + \ft Or: useless \f*. 
\q However, Yahweh can honor me as he pleases; 
\q2 my God is the one who will reward me \add as I deserve\add*.”
\q
\v 5 Yahweh formed me when I was in \add my mother's\add* womb in order that I would serve him;
\q2 he appointed me to bring \add the people of\add* Israel back to himself \f + \ft doublet \f*.
\q Yahweh has honored me, 
\q2 and he is the one who has caused me to be strong. 
\q
\v 6 He says to me, 
\q “It is not enough for you to serve me 
\q2 by bringing the descendants of Jacob back to worship me again \f + \ft doublet \f*;
\q I also want you to be like \f + \ft metaphor \f* a light for the non-Jews; 
\q2 I want you to take my \add my message\add* about how to be saved to people all over the world.”
\b
\q
\v 7 Yahweh, the one who saves us, 
\q2 the Holy God of us Israeli people, 
\q says to the one who was despised and rejected by the \add people of
many\add* nations, 
\q2 to the one who is the slave of rulers, 
\q “\add Some day\add* kings will stand up to respect you when they see you,
\q2 and princes will bow down before you 
\q because \add you serve\add* me, Yahweh, the one who faithfully
\add does what I promise\add*. 
\q2 I am the Holy God to whom you Israelis belong, the one who has chosen you.”
\s The promise to restore Israel 
\p
\v 8 This is also what Yahweh says: 
\q “At a time when it pleases me, I will answer your prayers. 
\q2 On the day when you will be rescued \add from your oppressors\add*, I will help you.
\q I will protect you and enable you to establish an agreement with other nations.
\q2 And by what you do, I will re-establish your nation of Israel
\q and allow you to live\f + \ft Or: settle \f* again in your land that was abandoned.
\q
\v 9 I will say to those who were captured and exiled\f + \ft Or: taken to Babylonia \f*,
\q2 ‘Leave \add Babylonia\add* and return to your own country!’ 
\q And I will say to those who are in dark prisons, 
\q2 ‘Come out into the light!’ 
\q When that happens, they will again be like \f + \ft metaphor \f* sheep 
\q2 that eat grass in green pastures, 
\q2 on hills where \add previously\add* there was no grass. 
\q
\v 10 They will not be hungry or thirsty \add anymore\add*; 
\q2 the hot sun will not beat upon them again \f + \ft doublet \f*. 
\q I, Yahweh, will act mercifully toward them and lead them; 
\q2 I will lead them to where there are springs of cool water. 
\q
\v 11 And I will cause the mountains to become \add as though they
were\add* level roads, 
\q2 and I will prepare good highways \add for my people to travel on, to return to
Jerusalem\add*. 
\q
\v 12 My people will return from far away; 
\q2 some will come from the north, some from the west, 
\q2 some from southern Egypt.” 
\b
\q
\v 13  \add Because of what Yahweh has promised to do\add*, 
\q everything should shout joyfully— 
\q2 the sky and the earth and the mountains should sing, 
\q2 because Yahweh comforts his people, 
\q and he will pity those who are suffering. 
\b
\q
\v 14 The people of Jerusalem say, 
\q “Yahweh has abandoned us; 
\q2 he has forgotten about us.” 
\b
\q
\v 15 But \add Yahweh replies\add*, 
\q “That is not true! ◄Can a woman forget the infant that she is nursing?\f + \ft Or: A \f* woman certainly cannot forget the infant that she
is nursing!► \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* 
\q2 ◄Can she stop acting kindly toward the child to whom she has given birth?\f + \ft Or: She \f* certainly cannot stop acting kindly toward
the child to whom she has given birth!► \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* 
\q But even if a woman would do that, 
\q2 I will not forget you! 
\q
\v 16 Note that I have written your \add names\add* on the palms of my hands;
\q2 in my mind I can always see the walls of your city. 
\q
\v 17 Soon your children will be returning there \f + \ft Or: Those who rebuild your city will work more quickly than those who
destroyed it \f*, 
\q2 and all those who destroyed your city will leave. 
\q
\v 18 You will look around and see 
\q2 all of your children coming back to you. 
\q As surely as I live, 
\q2 they will be around you \add for you to show to people\add* 
\q2 like \f + \ft simile \f* a bride shows her wedding ornaments! 
\b
\q
\v 19 Your land has been ruined and caused to become desolate\f + \ft Or: abandoned \f* \f + \ft doublet \f*,
\q2 but \add some day\add* it will be filled with people, 
\q2 and those who conquered you will be far away. 
\q
\v 20 The children who were born while you were exiled\f + \ft Or: in Babylonia \f* \f + \ft metaphor \f* will return
\add to Jerusalem\add* and say, 
\q2 ‘This city is too small for us; 
\q2 We need more space to live in!’ 
\q
\v 21 Then you will think to yourselves \f + \ft metonymy \f*, 
\q2 ‘It is amazing that we have \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* all these children! 
\q Most of our children were dead, 
\q2 and the rest were exiled. 
\q2 We were left here alone; 
\q so we do not know \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* where all these children have come from!
\q2 Who raised them?’ ” 
\b
\p
\v 22 This is what Yahweh our God says: 
\q “Watch! \add It is as though\add* I will lift up my hand to signal to those who are not Israelis.
\q2 And they will carry your little sons and daughters on their shoulders
\q2 and bring them back to you. 
\q
\v 23 Kings will serve you and will tutor\f + \ft Or: teach \f* your children, 
\q2 and their queens will take care of your young children. 
\q They will prostrate themselves in front of you 
\q2 and lick the dust off your feet. 
\q When that happens, you will know that I am Yahweh; 
\q2 and those who trust in me will never be disappointed.” 
\b
\q
\v 24 There is no one \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* who can snatch valuable things from a soldier who has captured those things
\add in a war\add*; 
\q2 there is no one \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* who can force a tyrant\f + \ft Or: cruel man \f* to free the people whom he has captured.
\p
\v 25 But Yahweh says this: 
\q “\add Some day\add*, those who have been captured will be freed,
\q2 and the valuable things that tyrants\f + \ft Or: cruel men \f* have snatched from others will be returned,
\q because I will fight against those who fight against you, 
\q2 and I will rescue your children. 
\q
\v 26 And I will cause your enemies to destroy themselves \f + \ft metaphor \f* 
\q2 instead of murdering others. 
\q When that happens, everyone \add in the world\add* will know that I, Yahweh, am the one who saves you,
\q2 the one who rescues you from your enemies; 
\q2 everyone will know that I am the mighty God to whom \add you descendants
of\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* Jacob belong.”
