\s Israel's idolatry condemned 
\q
\v 1 Righteous people sometimes die \add when they are still young\add*,
\q2 and no one is concerned about it. 
\q Godly people \add sometimes\add* die because of disasters, 
\q2 and no one understands why. 
\q They are taken away in order that they will not endure more calamities,
\q2
\v 2 and now they have peace. 
\q They continually lived righteously, 
\q2 and now they rest \add peacefully\add* in their graves. 
\b
\q
\v 3  \add Yahweh says,\add* “But you who practice sorcery, come here!
\q2 You who worship idols \f + \ft metaphor \f*, 
\q2 \add listen to me\add*! 
\q
\v 4 Do you realize \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* whom you are ridiculing, 
\q2 and whom you are insulting? 
\q2 Do you realize \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* to whom you are sticking out your tongues?
\q \add You are insulting me, Yahweh\add*! 
\q2 You are \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* always rebelling against me and always lying. 
\q
\v 5 You are eager to have sex under every big green tree where you worship your gods.
\q You kill your children as sacrifices \add to your idols\add* in the dry riverbeds,
\q2 and also offer them as sacrifices to your idols in the rocky caves.
\q
\v 6  \add You take big\add* smooth stones from the riverbeds 
\q2 and worship them as your gods. 
\q You pour out \add wine\add* to be an offering to them, 
\q2 and you bring grain \add to burn for\add* an offering to them.
\q Do you think that I should not punish you for doing all those things?
\q
\v 7 You have sex \f + \ft euphemism \f* \add with cult prostitutes\add* on every hill and mountain,
\q2 and you go there to offer sacrifices \add to your gods\add*.
\q
\v 8 You have put fetishes\f + \ft Or: pagan symbols \f* behind your doors and doorposts
\q2 and you have deserted me. 
\q You have taken off your clothes \f + \ft euphemism \f* 
\q2 and climbed into your bed 
\q and invited more \add of your lovers\add* to come to bed with you.
\q You have paid them to have sex with you, 
\q2 and you have fondled their sexual organs. 
\q
\v 9 You have given \add fragrant\add* oil and lots of perfume to your god Molech,
\q2 and you sent messengers to distant countries \add to find other gods to
worship\add*; 
\q you \add even tried\add* to send \add messengers\add* to the place of the dead
\add to search for new gods\add*. 
\q
\v 10 You became weary because of doing all those things, 
\q2 but you never said, ‘It is useless \add for us to do that\add*.’
\q You found new strength for worshiping idols, 
\q2 so you continued to do that \f + \ft litotes \f*. 
\b
\q
\v 11 Was it because you were afraid \add of those idols more than you were afraid of
me\add* that you lied \add about what you were doing\add*, 
\q2 and you do not even think about [DOU, RHQ] me? 
\q Was it because I did not punish you for a long time that you are not afraid of me \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*?
\q
\v 12 You \add think that\add* \f + \ft irony \f* the things that you have done are right,
\q2 but I will tell the truth. 
\q It will not help you to do any of those things. 
\q
\v 13 When you cry out \add for help\add* to your collection of idols,
\q2 they will not rescue you. 
\q The wind will blow them away \f + \ft doublet \f*. 
\q2 But those who trust in me will live in the land \add of Israel\add*,
\q and \add they will worship me on\add* \add Zion\add*, my sacred hill.”
\s Yahweh will rescue his people. 
\p
\v 14 Yahweh will say, “Prepare \add yourselves to receive\add* me,
\q2 like \f + \ft metaphor \f* people build and prepare a road \add for a king to come
on\add*. 
\q Get rid of \add the things that are causing you to sin\add* 
\q2 like \f + \ft metaphor \f* people remove from a road obstacles\f + \ft Or: things that cause people to stumble \f*.
\q
\v 15 Because this is what I, Yahweh, who am holy and greatly honored and who live forever, say:
\q I live in the highest heaven, where \add everything\add* is holy,
\q2 but I also am with those who are humble and who are sorry for the sinful things that they have done.
\q I will greatly encourage \f + \ft doublet \f* those who have repented. 
\q
\v 16 I will not accuse people forever; 
\q2 I will not always be angry with them, 
\q because \add if I did that\add*, people would become weak\f + \ft Or: discouraged \f*;
\q2 all the people whom I created and caused to live would die. 
\q
\v 17 I was angry \add with my people\add* because they sinned by wanting the things that others had.
\q2 So because I was angry, I punished them and turned away from them,
\q2 but they continued sinning. 
\q
\v 18 I have seen the evil things that they continually do, 
\q2 but I will restore them and lead them. 
\q I will encourage\f + \ft Or: comfort \f* them. 
\q2 And to those who are mourning, 
\q2
\v 19 I will enable them to sing songs to praise me. 
\q I will restore \add all my people\add*, those who live near \add Jerusalem\add* and those who live far away,
\q2 and I will cause things to go well for them. 
\q
\v 20 Wicked people \add do not have peace in their inner beings\add*;
\q2 they are like \f + \ft simile \f* a sea \add whose waves are\add* always churning up mud,
\q
\v 21 and I, Yahweh, say that things will never go well\f + \ft Or: be peaceful \f* for those who are evil.”
