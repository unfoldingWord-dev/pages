\c 62  
\s Isaiah's prayer for Jerusalem 
\q
\v 1 Because I am very concerned about \add the people of\add* Jerusalem \f + \fr doublet \f*,
\q2 I will do something to help them. 
\q I will not stop praying for them 
\q2 until they are rescued/freed \add from their oppressors\add*,
\q until that becomes as apparent to everyone as the dawn \add every
morning\add*, 
\q2 until people can see it as clearly as \f + \fr simile \f* they see a torch shining brightly
\add at night\add*. 
\b
\q
\v 2  \add Some day\add* the \add people of many\add* nations will know that Yahweh has rescued you,
\add his people\add*. 
\q2 Their kings will see that your city is very great/glorious. 
\q And Yahweh \f + \fr metonymy \f* will give your \add city\add* a new name. 
\q
\v 3  \add It will be as though\add* Yahweh will hold you up in his hands in order that everyone can see you.
\q2 Under his authority \f + \fr metonymy \f*, you will be like a glorious headband/turban worn by a king.
\q
\v 4 Your \add city\add* will never again be called 'the deserted/abandoned city' and your country will never again be called
'the desolate land;' 
\q2 it will be called 'the land that Yahweh delights in,' 
\q2 and \add it will also be called\add* 'married to Yahweh.' 
\q It will be called that because Yahweh will be delighted with you,
\q2 \add and it will be as though\add* you are his bride \f + \fr metaphor \f*. 
\q
\v 5 You people will live in all the country of Judah 
\q2 like \f + \fr simile \f* a young man lives with his bride. 
\q And our God will be happy that you \add belong to\add* him 
\q2 like \f + \fr simile \f* a bridegroom is happy that his bride \add belongs to
him\add*. 
\q
\v 6 You people of Jerusalem, I have placed watchmen on your walls;
\q2 they will \f + \fr litotes \f* earnestly pray to Yahweh day and night. 
\q You watchmen, you must not stop \add praying\add* 
\q2 and reminding Yahweh \add about what he has promised to do\add*.
\q
\v 7 And tell Yahweh that he should not rest 
\q2 until he causes Jerusalem to be \add a city that is\add* famous throughout the world.
\b
\q
\v 8 Yahweh has raised his right hand to solemnly promise to the people of Jerusalem,
\q2 “I will use my power \f + \fr metonymy \f* and never again allow your enemies to defeat you;
\q \add soldiers from other nations will never come again\add* to take away your grain
\q2 and the wine that you worked hard \add to produce\add*. 
\q
\v 9 You yourselves grew the grain, 
\q2 and you will be the ones who will praise me, Yahweh, while you eat
\add the bread made from\add* the grain. 
\q Inside the courtyards of my temple 
\q2 you yourselves will drink the wine made from the grapes \add that you
harvested\add*.” 
\b
\q
\v 10 Go out through the \add city\add* gates! 
\q2 Prepare the highway on which people will return \add from other
countries\add*! 
\q Cause the road to become smooth; 
\q2 clear off all the stones; 
\q set up signal flags to help the people-groups to see \add where the road to Jerusalem
is\add*. 
\b
\q
\v 11 This is the message that Yahweh has sent to the people of every nation:
\q2 “Tell the people of Israel, ‘The one who will rescue/save you is coming!
\q Look! He will be bringing to you ◄your reward/what you deserve for the good things that you have done►;
\q2 those whom he is setting free will be going ahead of him.’ ”
\q
\v 12 They will be called 'Yahweh's own people, 
\q2 the ones whom he rescued.' 
\q And Jerusalem will be known as the city that \add Yahweh\add* loves,
\q2 the city that is no longer abandoned.
