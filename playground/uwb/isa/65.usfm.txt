\c 65  
\s God's punishment of the rebellious Israelis 
\p
\v 1  \add This is what Yahweh said\add*: 
\q “I was ready to reply \add to my people\add*, 
\q2 but no one requested me \add to help them\add*. 
\q I was ready to help even those who did not call out to me. 
\q2 I continued to say, ‘I am here \add to help you\add*!’ 
\q
\v 2  \add It is as though\add* I have continually held out my arms
\add to show that I am ready to help\add* my people who rebel against me,
\q2 and who continually do the evil things that they want to do.
\q
\v 3 They boldly continual to do things that cause me to be angry:
\q2 they offer sacrifices \add to their idols\add* in their gardens,
\q and they burn incense to them on \add altars made of\add* bricks.
\q
\v 4 They secretly remain awake at night in burial caves, 
\q2 \add talking with the spirits of\add* ◄\add dead people/their
ancestors\add*►. 
\q They eat the meat of pigs, 
\q2 and their pots are full of \add other\add* meat that is also unacceptable to me.
\q
\v 5 Then they say to others, 
\q2 ‘Stay away from me; do not come near me, 
\q because I am very holy, 
\q2 \add with the result that you should not touch me\add*.’ 
\q People like that are like [MET] smoke in my nose 
\q2 from a fire that burns continually. 
\q
\v 6 I have written \add a record of all the evil things that they have
done\add*. 
\q2 And I will not do nothing about all those things; 
\q I will certainly punish them 
\q2
\v 7 for the sins that they and their ancestors have committed. 
\q They have mocked/insulted me by burning incense \add to their
idols\add* on the hilltops. 
\q2 So I will punish them like they deserve for doing those things.”
\p
\v 8 This is also what Yahweh said: 
\q “When there is a cluster of nice grapes on a vine, 
\q people do not throw them away, 
\q2 because they know that there is good juice in those grapes. 
\q Similarly, because there are some \add people in Judah\add* who faithfully serve/worship me,
\q2 I will not get rid of all of them. 
\q
\v 9 I will spare some of the descendants of Jacob 
\q2 who are living on the hills of Judah. 
\q I have chosen them, and they will possess that land; 
\q2 they will worship/serve me, and they will live there. 
\q
\v 10 Then all the land from the Sharon Plain \add near the Mediterranean
Sea\add* and \add as far east as\add* Achor Valley \add near Jericho\add* will become pastureland
\q2 where their cattle and sheep will rest. 
\b
\q
\v 11 But \add it will be different\add* for you who have abandoned me,
\q2 you who do not worship me on Zion my sacred hill, 
\q you who worship Gad and Meni, \add the gods who you think will bring
you\add* good luck and good fortune. 
\q
\v 12  \add It is I, not Meni, who will decide/say what will happen to
you\add*; 
\q2 you will all \add be slaughtered by\add* swords. 
\q \add That will happen because\add* you did not answer 
\q2 when I called out to you. 
\q I spoke to you, 
\q2 but you did not pay attention. 
\q Instead, you did things that I said are evil; 
\q2 you chose to do things that do not please me. 
\q
\v 13 I, Yahweh the Lord, will give to those who worship and obey me things to eat and drink,
\q2 and they will be happy; 
\q but all you evil people will be hungry and thirsty, 
\q2 and you will be \add sad and\add* disgraced. 
\q
\v 14 Those who worship and obey me will sing joyfully, 
\q but you \add evil people\add* will wail loudly 
\q2 because you will be suffering in your inner beings. 
\q
\v 15 Those whom I have chosen will use your names when they curse people;
\q I, Yahweh the Lord, will get rid of you. 
\q2 But I will give to those who worship and obey me a new name \add that they will use when they bless
people\add*. 
\q
\v 16 The people in this land have had many troubles, 
\q2 but I will cause those troubles to occur no more. 
\q Therefore those who request me to bless them and those who solemnly promise to do something
\q2 should never forget that I am God, who faithfully \add do what I promise to
do\add*.” 
\s Yahweh's new creation 
\q
\v 17 “Note this: \add Some day\add* I will create a new heaven and a new earth.
\q2 \add They will be very wonderful, with the result that\add* you will no longer think about all the
\add troubles\add* you had previously. 
\q
\v 18 Be glad and always rejoice because of what I will do: 
\q2 Jerusalem will be a place where people rejoice; 
\q2 the people who live there will always be happy. 
\q
\v 19 I will rejoice about Jerusalem, 
\q2 and I will be delighted with my people. 
\q People will no longer weep or cry because of being distressed.
\b
\q
\v 20 No child will die when it is still an infant; 
\q2 all people will live until they are very old. 
\q \add People will consider that\add* anyone who is a hundred years old is still young;
\q2 \add they will consider that\add* anyone who dies who is younger than that has been cursed.
\q
\v 21 My people will build houses and then live in them. 
\q2 They will plant vineyards and then eat grapes from those vineyards.
\q
\v 22 The houses that they build, no one will \add take those houses away from them
and\add* live in them. 
\q2 No one will take a vineyard away from its owner. 
\q My chosen people will live a long time, like trees do, 
\q2 and they will enjoy the things that they have done— 
\q \add the houses that they have built and the crops that they have
planted\add*. 
\q
\v 23 They will not work hard in vain, 
\q2 and their children will not die from some ◄calamity/terrible thing happening to them►.
\q I will certainly bless their children and their grandchildren.
\q
\v 24 Before they call to me \add to help them\add*, I will answer;
\q2 I will answer their prayers while they are still praying \add for me to do something for
them\add*. 
\q
\v 25 No one will be harmed or injured anywhere on Zion, my sacred hill:
\q wolves and lambs will eat grass together \add peacefully\add*;
\q2 lions will eat hay like oxen do, \add and they will not attack
people\add*. 
\q2 Snakes will \add not hurt anyone; they will lie on the ground
and\add* eat only dirt. 
\q \add That is surely what it will be like because\add* I, Yahweh, have said it.”
