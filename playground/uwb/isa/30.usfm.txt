\c 30  
\s Judah's worthless treaty with Egypt 
\q
\v 1 Yahweh says, “Terrible things will happen to you, my people who rebel against me.
\q2 You make plans, but what you plan is not what I want. 
\q You have made an alliance \add with the rulers of Egypt\add*,
\q2 but you did not ask my Spirit \add if that was what you should
do\add*. 
\q2 By doing that, you have increased the number of your sins. 
\q
\v 2 You went to Egypt \add to ask their rulers for help\add*, 
\q2 without asking for my advice. 
\q You have trusted in \add the army of\add* the king of Egypt to protect you;
\q you have \add trusted in them\add* 
\q2 like people sit in the shade \add to protect themselves from the
sun\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f*. 
\q
\v 3 But the result of your trusting in the king of Egypt is that you will be
\add disappointed and\add* disgraced; 
\q2 because of trusting in him, you will be humiliated. 
\q
\v 4 Officials/ambassadors \add from Judah\add* have gone to Zoan and Hanes
\add cities in Egypt to make treaties\add*, 
\q
\v 5 but all those \add who trust in the King of Egypt\add* will be humiliated,
\q2 because that nation will not be able to help you; 
\q the treaty that you have made \add requesting help from them\add* will be useless;
\q2 instead, the result will be that you will be humiliated and disgraced \f + \fr doublet \f*.”
\p
\v 6  \add I received from Yahweh\add* this message about the animals in the southern part of Judah:
\q That area is one where \add people experience a lot of\add* troubles and difficulties,
\q2 an area where there are male and female lions 
\q2 and various kinds of poisonous snakes. 
\q Caravans go through that area 
\q2 taking donkeys and camels loaded with valuable goods. 
\q \add They are taking them\add* to Egypt to seek for protection
\add by the army of Egypt\add*, 
\q2 but it will be useless. 
\q2
\v 7 The promises made by \add the king of\add* Egypt are worthless;
\q therefore I call Egypt 'the sea monster/dragon that does nothing.'
\s A warning for Judah 
\q
\v 8 Yahweh told me to write on a scroll a message, 
\q2 in order that it would be a witness \add to the people of Judah\add*
\q that would endure forever. 
\q
\v 9  \add It would remind them that\add* that they are deceitful and always rebelling against Yahweh;
\q2 they refuse to pay attention to what he tells/teaches them. 
\q
\v 10 They tell the people who see/receive visions \add from Yahweh\add*,
\q2 “Stop seeing visions!” 
\q They tell the prophets, 
\q2 “Do not reveal to us what is right! 
\q Tell us pleasant things; 
\q2 do not tell us visions about things that are true! 
\q
\v 11 Stop doing what you have been doing \f + \fr doublet \f*; 
\q2 stop telling us what the Holy One of Israel \add says to us\add*!”
\p
\v 12 Therefore, this is what the Holy One of Israel says: 
\q “You have rejected my message, 
\q2 and you are relying on those who oppress and deceive others.
\q
\v 13 Therefore, the result of your sin \add of rejecting me\add* will be that you will
\add suddenly experience disasters\add*; 
\q2 what will happen to you will be like \f + \fr simile \f* a cracked wall that suddenly collapses \f + \fr doublet \f*.
\q
\v 14 You will be smashed like a clay jar is smashed \add when it is
dropped\add*, 
\q and it shatters completely, with the result that there is not one piece big enough
\q2 to carry some coals from a stove 
\q2 or to carry a little bit of water from a well.” 
\p
\v 15 Yahweh, our God, the Holy One of Israel, also says this: 
\q “You will be rescued \add from your enemies\add* only if you repent and trust
\add in what I will do for you\add*; 
\q2 you will be strong only if you quit worrying and trust in me.
\q But you do not want to do that. 
\q
\v 16 You said, ‘No, we will escape on horses \add that the army of Egypt will give
us\add*!’ 
\q2 So, you will try to flee. 
\q You said, ‘We will escape \add from the army of Assyria\add* by riding on swift horses!’
\q2 But those who pursue you will also ride swiftly. 
\q
\v 17  \add As a result\add*, a thousand of you will flee when only one of them pursues you!
\q When five of their soldiers threaten \add to kill you\add*, 
\q2 all of you will flee. 
\q \add Only a few of\add* you will be left, like \f + \fr simile \f* a single flagpole on top of a mountain
\q2 with one signal flag on the pole.” 
\b
\q
\v 18 But Yahweh wants to act kindly toward you; 
\q2 he desires to show you that he acts mercifully. 
\q \add Do not forget that\add* Yahweh is a God who acts justly;
\q2 he is pleased with those who patiently trust in him. 
\s Yahweh will help his people 
\p
\v 19 You people who live in Jerusalem \f + \fr doublet \f*, \add some day\add* you will not cry anymore. Yahweh will be kind to you when you
call out to him for help. He will answer/help you as soon as he hears you call.
\v 20 Although now Yahweh has caused you to daily experience \f + \fr metaphor \f* great troubles and suffer much, he, your teacher, will not
hide himself from you. He \f + \fr synecdoche \f* will teach you many things clearly.
\v 21 And you will hear him speak to you to guide you. Right behind you he will say, “This is the road on which you should
walk; walk on this road!” 
\v 22 When that happens, you will destroy all your idols that are covered with silver or gold. You will throw them away like
you throw away a filthy rag, and you will say to them, “We do not need you anymore!”
\p
\v 23 If you do that, Yahweh will bless you by giving you good rain at the time that you plant your crops. You will have good
harvests, and plenty of big fields with grass for your cattle to eat.
\v 24 After the wind \add blows away the chaff\add*, the oxen and donkeys that
\add pull the plow to\add* plow your ground will have good grain to eat.
\v 25 At that time, when \add your enemies\add* have been slaughtered and their towers have ◄collapsed/been destroyed►, there
will be streams flowing down every hill and mountain \add in Judah\add*.
\v 26 The moon will seem to shine as brightly as the sun, and the sun will seem to shine seven times as brightly as previously.
That is what it will be like when Yahweh causes \add the suffering
of\add* his people \add to cease; it will be as though\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f* he will be putting bandages on their wounds and healing them.
\b
\q
\v 27  \add It is as though\add* we see Yahweh coming from far away;
\q2 he is extremely angry, 
\q and there are thick clouds of smoke around him. 
\q2 By what he says \f + \fr metonymy \f* he shows that he is angry; 
\q2 what he says is like \f + \fr simile \f* a devastating/destructive fire. 
\q
\v 28 His breath is like \f + \fr simile \f* a flood that covers \add his enemies\add* up to their necks.
\q2 He will separate \f + \fr metaphor \f* the nations in order to destroy some of them;
\q2 \add it is as though\add* he will put hooks in their mouths and take them away.
\q
\v 29 But \add his people\add* will sing joyfully 
\q2 like they sing during the nights when they celebrate a holy festival.
\q They will be very joyful, 
\q2 like \f + \fr simile \f* \add a large group of his people\add* are joyful when they go up to Zion Hill in Jerusalem,
\q along with men playing flutes 
\q \add when they are all going there to worship Yahweh\add*. 
\q2 He is like \f + \fr metaphor \f* a huge rock under which we Israeli people \add are
safe\add*. 
\q
\v 30 And Yahweh will enable us to hear him speaking powerfully/majestically.
\q2 He will show us that he \f + \fr synecdoche \f* is very powerful. 
\q We will see him \f + \fr synecdoche \f* smash \add his enemies\add*. 
\q2 Being very angry, he will descend with a big rainstorm and thunder and hail
\add to punish them\add*. 
\q
\v 31  \add The soldiers of\add* Assyria will be terrified when they hear the voice of Yahweh
\q2 and when he strikes them with his rod. 
\q
\v 32 And while Yahweh strikes them to punish them, 
\q2 \add his people\add* will \add celebrate by\add* playing tambourines and harps.
\q \add It will be as though\add* Yahweh will lift up his powerful hand/arm and defeat the Assyrian army in battle.
\q
\v 33 The valley of Topheth \add outside Jerusalem\add* has been prepared for a long time;
\q2 it is ready for the king \add of Assyria\add*; 
\q the ◄funeral pyre/pile of wood► \add for burning his body\add* is wide and high,
\q2 and \add it will be as though\add* Yahweh will light the fire with his breath,
\q2 which will come out like a stream of burning sulfur.
