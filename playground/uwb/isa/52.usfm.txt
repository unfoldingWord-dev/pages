\c 52  
\s Jerusalem's suffering will end 
\q
\v 1  \add You people who live in the\add* holy city of Jerusalem \f + \fr apostrophe \f*, wake up!
\q2 Be strong again! 
\q Show that \f + \fr metonymy \f* your city is beautiful and glorious; 
\q2 foreigners who do not believe in God will not enter your city again
\add to attack you\add*. 
\q
\v 2 People of Jerusalem, get up from sitting in the dust 
\q2 and sit in places where people are honored! 
\q You people who have returned from being exiled, 
\q2 take off from your neck the chains which were fastened around you
\add in Babylonia\add*, 
\p
\v 3 because this is what Yahweh says: 
\q “\add When you were taken to Babylonia\add*, 
\q2 no one paid me for doing that. 
\q So now I will bring you back 
\q2 without \add being required to\add* pay for you!” 
\b
\p
\v 4 Yahweh our Lord also says this: 
\q “Long ago, my people went to Egypt to live there. 
\q2 Later they were being ◄oppressed/treated cruelly► by \add the soldiers
of\add* Assyria. 
\p
\v 5 But now think about what is happening: 
\q My people are being forced to be slaves again, this time by the
\add people of Babylonia\add*. 
\q2 And \add those who have conquered them this time have also\add* paid me nothing,
\q and they despise me \f + \fr metonymy \f* continually \f + \fr doublet \f*. 
\q
\v 6 But my people will then have a close relationship with \f + \fr metonymy \f* me,
\q2 and when that happens, they will know that I am the one who predicted/promised
\add that it would happen\add*. 
\q It is I, \add Yahweh, who will do it\add*.” 
\s A message of encouragement for Jerusalem 
\q
\v 7 It is a wonderful thing when messengers \f + \fr metonymy \f* arrive on the mountains/hills,
\q2 bringing good news, 
\q the news about \add God giving us\add* peace and saving us, 
\q the news that the God to whom we \add Israeli people\add* belong is now ruling/king!
\q
\v 8 The watchmen \add who are guarding the city\add* will shout and sing joyfully,
\q2 because while they are watching 
\q they will see Yahweh returning to Jerusalem. 
\q
\v 9 Jerusalem has been ruined, 
\q2 but the people who are there now should start to sing joyfully,
\q because Yahweh will encourage his people; 
\q2 he will set his people free and bring them back to Jerusalem.
\b
\q
\v 10 Yahweh will show all the nations that he is holy and powerful.
\q People in the most remote/distant places on earth will know 
\q2 that he has rescued his people. 
\b
\q
\v 11 So, leave \add the places where you were taken to when you were
captured\add*, 
\q2 where \add everything is\add* unacceptable to God. 
\q You men who carry the items used for the worship of Yahweh, 
\q2 leave there \add and return to Jerusalem\add*, 
\q2 and purify yourselves \add in order to be acceptable to worship
God\add*. 
\q
\v 12 But it will not \add be necessary for you to\add* leave suddenly,
\q2 to flee in panic, 
\q because Yahweh will ◄go in front of/lead► you; 
\q2 and he will also protect you \add from being attacked\add* at the rear
\add while you travel\add*. 
\s God's suffering servant 
\q
\v 13 Yahweh says, “Listen carefully! 
\q2 My servant will act wisely (OR, do the right things to accomplish what he wants to),
\q and I will highly exalt him.” 
\q
\v 14 But many people will be appalled when they see what has happened to him.
\q2 \add Because of his being beaten very badly\add*, his appearance will be changed;
\q3 people will hardly recognize that he is a human. 
\q
\v 15 But he will cause people of many nations to be surprised; 
\q2 even kings will be silent when they stand in front of him, 
\q because they will see someone that no one had told them about previously,
\q2 and they will understand things that they had not heard about before.
