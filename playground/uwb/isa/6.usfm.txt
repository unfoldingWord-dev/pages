\c 6  
\s God appointed Isaiah to be a prophet 
\p
\v 1 During the year that King Uzziah died, Yahweh showed me a vision.
\add In the vision\add*, I saw Yahweh sitting on a throne, high above everyone. He
\add was wearing a very long\add* robe that covered \add the floor
of\add* the temple. 
\v 2 Above him were standing several winged creatures. Each of them had six wings. They covered their faces with two of their
wings, they covered their feet with two of their wings, and they flew using two of their wings.
\v 3 They were calling to each other, saying, 
\q “The Almighty Commander of the armies of angels is holy; 
\q2 he is completely holy! 
\q The entire earth is filled with his glory.” 
\m
\v 4 When they spoke, it caused the doorposts/foundations of the temple to shake, and the temple was filled with smoke.
\p
\v 5 Then I said, “Terrible things will happen to me, because everything that I say \f + \fr metonymy \f* is sinful, and I live among people
who constantly say \f + \fr metonymy \f* sinful things. I will be destroyed because I have seen the Almighty Commander of the armies of
angels!” 
\p
\v 6 Then one of the winged creatures took a hot coal from the altar, using a pair of tongs. He flew to me
\v 7 and touched my lips with the coal. Then he said, “Look \add at what I have
done\add*. I have touched your lips \add with this coal\add*. Now your guilt is ended, and your sins are forgiven \f + \fr doublet \f*.”
\p
\v 8 Then I heard Yahweh asking, “Whom shall I send \add to be a messenger to my
people\add*? Who will go \add and speak\add* for us?” I replied, “I am here. Send me!”
\p
\v 9 Then he said, 
\q “Okay, go, and say to the \add Israeli\add* people, 
\q2 ‘You will listen carefully \add to what I say\add*, but you will not understand it.
\q You will look very carefully \add at the things that I am doing\add*,
\q2 but you will not understand them.’ 
\q
\v 10  \add What you(sg) say will\add* cause these people to become stubborn [IDI];
\q2 it will cause them not to be able to hear \add what I say\add* and see
\add what I do\add*. 
\q As a result, they will not see \add what I want them to see\add* or hear
\add what I want them to hear\add*, 
\q2 and they will not understand it with their inner beings, 
\q and they will not turn to me 
\q2 and be saved \add from being punished\add*.” 
\p
\v 11 Then I said, “How long \add do you want me to continue to do
that\add*?” 
\q He replied, “Do it until their cities are ruined \add by their
enemies\add*, 
\q2 until no one is living in their houses, 
\q do it until all the crops are stolen from their fields 
\q2 and the fields are ruined. 
\q
\v 12 Do it until I have ◄exiled everyone/forced everyone to go to their enemies' lands► far away,
\q2 and the whole land \add of Israel\add* is deserted. 
\q
\v 13 If even one tenth of the people survive and stay there, 
\q2 \add their enemies\add* will \add invade the land again and\add* burn everything.
\q But, just like \f + \fr metaphor \f* when an oak tree is cut down, a stump is left
\add from which new shoots will grow\add*, 
\q2 the people who remain \add in this land will be a group that\add* is ◄set apart for/dedicated to► me.”
