\s Good news for oppressed people 
\q
\v 1 The Spirit of Yahweh our Lord is on me; 
\q2 he has appointed \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* me to bring good news to those who are oppressed,
\q to comfort those who are discouraged, 
\q2 to free all those who are \add as though they are chained\f + \ft Or: tied \f*\add* \\f + \\ft doublet \\f* by their wrong things that they continually do.
\q
\v 2 He has sent me to tell those who mourn about the members of their families who died \f + \ft (OR,
\add who are still in Babylonia) \f*\add* 
\q2 that now is the time when Yahweh will act kindly \add toward his
people\add*; 
\q now is the time when our God will ◄get revenge on\f + \ft Or: punish \f*► their enemies.
\q
\v 3 To all those in Jerusalem who mourn, 
\q he will give flower necklaces \add to wear\add* 
\q2 instead of ashes \add that they put on their heads to show that they were
sad\add*; 
\q he will cause them to rejoice \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* instead of being sad; 
\q2 he will enable them to be \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* happy instead of being discouraged.
\q They will be called 'people who continually do what is right,
\q2 people who are like \add tall\f + \ft Or: strong \f*\add* oak trees that Yahweh has planted'
\q to show others that he is very great. 
\b
\q
\v 4  \add Those who return from Babylon\add* will rebuild the cities that
\add the soldiers from Babylon\add* tore down. 
\q2 \add Even though\add* those cities have been destroyed and abandoned for many years,
\q they will be restored\f + \ft Or: rebuilt \f*. 
\q
\v 5 Foreigners will be the ones who will take care of your flocks
\add of sheep and goats\add*, 
\q2 and plow your fields and take care of your grapevines. 
\q
\v 6 But you \add are the ones who\add* will be like the priests to serve Yahweh,
\q2 to work for God. 
\q You will enjoy valuable goods \add that are brought\add* from other nations,
\q2 and you will be happy that those things have become yours. 
\q
\v 7 Previously you were shamed and disgraced, 
\q2 but now you will have great blessings; 
\q previously your enemies humbled you, 
\q2 but now you will have many good things; 
\q you will be happy because of being in your land again, 
\q2 and you will rejoice forever. 
\b
\q
\v 8 “I, Yahweh, am very pleased with those\f + \ft Or: judges \f* who decide matters fairly;
\q2 I hate \add those who illegally\add* take things from other people.
\q I will surely repay my people 
\q2 ◄for\f + \ft Or: because \f* of► all that they have suffered \add in the past\add*.
\q And I will make an everlasting agreement with them. 
\q
\v 9 Their descendants will be honored by people of other nations \\f + \\ft doublet \\f*.
\q2 Everyone who sees them will know that they are a nation that I, Yahweh, have blessed.”
\b
\q
\v 10 I greatly rejoice because of what Yahweh \add has done\add*!
\q2 I am happy in all my inner being, 
\q because he has saved me and declared that I am righteous; 
\q2 \add those blessings are like\add* \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* a robe that he has put on me.
\q I am \add as happy as\add* \\f + \\ft simile \\f* a bridegroom in his wedding suit,
\q2 or a bride wearing jewels. 
\q
\v 11 Just as \add seeds sown in\add* a garden sprout from the soil and grow \\f + \\ft doublet \\f*,
\q2 Yahweh our God will cause \add people of\add* all nations to act righteously,
\q with the result that they will praise him for doing that.
