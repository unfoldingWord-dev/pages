\v 1  \add You all know me as\add* the \add chief\add* Elder. \add I am writing this
letter\add* to all of you \f + \ft metaphor \f* in your congregation. \add God has\add* chosen
\add you\add*, and I love you truly! Not only do I myself love you, but all those who know
\add and accept the\add* true message \add that Jesus taught\add* also love you!
\v 2 All of us \add believe God's\add* true message. It is in our
\add inner beings\f + \ft Or: hearts\add* \f* and we will continue \add to believe
it\add* forever! 
\v 3 God the Father and Jesus Christ, who is his Son\f + \ft Or: the man who is also God \f*, will continue
\add to act\add* kindly and mercifully \add toward us because they\add* love
\add us. They will enable us to have inner\add* peace, \add because we
believe\add* their true message. 
\s 2 John 4 
\s I am happy that some of your members are living just like God commanded us to live.
\p
\v 4 I am very happy because I learned about some of you \f + \ft synecdoche \f* who are conducting your lives in a manner that is consistent\f + \ft Or: in
accordance \f* with \add God's\add* true message. You are doing that just like our Father
\add God\add* commanded us \add to do\add*. 
\s 2 John 5-6 
\s Continue to love each other just like God commanded us to love when we first began to believe his true message.
\p
\v 5 And now, dear congregation \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add there is something that\add* I am requesting you
\add to do\add*. I am writing this not to command that you do something new, but
\add that you continue to do\add* what God commanded when we first began \f + \ft metonymy \f*
\add to believe his true message. What he commanded\add* is that we love each other.
\v 6 And \add we really\f + \ft Or: truly \f*\add* are loving \add God\add* when we are conducting our lives in accordance with whatever he
commands \add us to do\add*. What he commands us to do is to continue
\add to love one another\add*. That is exactly what you heard when you first began \f + \ft metonymy \f*
\add to believe God's true message\add*. 
\s 2 John 7-11 
\s Be on your guard against teachers of false doctrine, so that you will receive your complete reward of being with God
eternally. Do not welcome or encourage any of these false teachers in any way.
\p
\v 7 Many people who deceive \add others have left your congregation
and\add* have now gone out among other people who are \add in your
area\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*. They are the ones who do not acknowledge\f + \ft Or: refuse to say \f* that Jesus Christ became human. They are the very
ones who deceive \add people\add* and oppose \add what we teach about\add* Christ.
\v 8  \add So\add* be sure that \add you do not let those teachers deceive
you!\add* If you let them deceive you, you will lose \add the reward\add* which we,
\add together with you\add*, have been working for, and you will not receive the complete reward
\add of being eternally united to God!\add* 
\v 9 Those who change what Christ taught and do not continue \add to
believe\add* what he taught do not have\add a relationship with\add* God.
\add But\add* those who continue to believe \add what Christ\add* taught have
\add a close relationship with\add* both \add God, our\add* Father, and with his Son\f + \ft Or: the one who is also God \f*.
\v 10 So when anyone comes to you who teaches something different from
\add what Christ\add* taught, do not welcome him into your homes! Do not
\add encourage him by\add* wishing him well\f + \ft Or: greeting him as a fellow believer \f*
\add in any way!\add* 
\v 11  \add I say that\add* because if you treat people like that as you would treat a fellow believer,
\add God will punish you\add* along with them for the evil that they do.
\s 2 John 12-13 
\s Instead of writing much more to you, I expect to come and talk directly with you. The members of your sister congregation
greet you. 
\p
\v 12  \add Even though\add* I have much \add more that I want\add* to tell you, I have decided not
\add to say it\add* in a letter \f + \ft metonymy \f*. Instead, I expect to be with you
\add soon\add* and talk directly with you. Then we can be completely joyful
\add together\add*. 
\v 13 Your fellow believers here \f + \ft metaphor \f*, ones whom \add God\add* has also chosen, send their greetings to you\f + \ft Or: say that they are
thinking affectionately about you \f*.
