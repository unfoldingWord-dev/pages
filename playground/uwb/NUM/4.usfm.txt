\s The work of the clans descended from Kohath 
\p
\v 1 Then Yahweh said to Moses/me, 
\v 2 “Write down the names of the men who belong to the clans descended from Kohath.
\v 3 Write the names of the men who are between 30 and 50 years old. These will be men who will do work at the Sacred Tent.
\p
\v 4 The work of these descendants of Kohath will be \add to take care
of\add* the sacred items \add that are used when the people worship\add* at the Sacred Tent.
\v 5 When you Israelis move to another location, Aaron and his sons must enter the tent to take down the curtain that separates
the very holy place from the other part of the tent. They must cover the sacred chest with that curtain.
\v 6 Then they must cover that with a nice covering made from the skins of goats. Over that they must spread a blue cloth. Then
they must insert into the rings on the chest the poles \add for carrying
it\add*. 
\p
\v 7 Then they must put a blue cloth over the table on which the priests put the sacred bread. On top of the cloth they must
put the bowls \add for incense\add*, the pans, the other dishes, the jars for
\add the wine that will be\add* offered as a sacrifice, and the sacred bread.
\v 8 Over all of this they must spread a scarlet/red cloth. Finally, they must put on top a nice covering made from the skins
of goats. Then they must insert into the \add rings at the corners
of\add* the tables the poles \add for carrying it\add*. 
\p
\v 9 Then with another blue cloth they must cover the lampstand, the lamps, the lamp snuffers, the trays, and the special jars
of \add olive\add* oil \add to burn in the lamps\add*. 
\v 10 They must cover the lampstand and all the other items with a nice covering made from the skins of goats. They must place
all these things on a frame for carrying them. 
\p
\v 11 Then they must spread another blue cloth over the gold altar
\add which is used for burning\add* incense. Over this they must spread a nice covering made from the skins of goats. Then they
must insert into \add the rings of\add* that altar the poles for carrying it.
\p
\v 12 They must take all the other items that are inside the Sacred Tent and wrap them in a blue cloth, cover that with a nice
covering made from the skins of goats, and place all that on a frame for carrying it.
\p
\v 13 Then they must remove the ashes from the altar \add on which they have burned
sacrifices\add*. Then they must cover the altar with a purple cloth.
\v 14 Then they must spread on top of the cloth all the items used at the altar—the pans
\add for carrying the hot coals\add*, the meat forks, the shovels, the bowls
\add for containing the blood to sprinkle on the people\add*, and all the other containers. Then they must spread over all
those things a nice covering made from the skins of goats. Then they must insert into
\add the rings at the sides of\add* the altar the poles \add for carrying
it\add*. 
\p
\v 15 When Aaron and his sons have finished covering all these sacred things, the Israeli people will be ready to move
\add to a new location\add*. The descendants of Kohath must come and carry all the sacred things to
\add the next place\add* where the Israelis will set up their tents. But the descendants of Kohath must not touch any of these
sacred items, because they will \add immediately\add* die \add if they touch
them\add*. They are the ones who will carry these things, \add but they must not touch
them\add*. 
\p
\v 16 Aaron's son Eleazar will have the work of taking care of the
\add olive\add* oil for the lamps, the nice-smelling incense, the grain which will be burned on the altar each day, and the
\add olive\add* oil for anointing \add the priests\add*. Eleazar is the one who will supervise the work that is done at the
Sacred Tent and the men who take care of everything that is in it.”
\p
\v 17 Then Yahweh said to Aaron and Moses/me, 
\v 18-20 “When the descendants of Kohath approach the sacred items in the Sacred Tent
\add to take them to another location\add*, Aaron and his sons must always go in with them and show each of them what work to
do and what things to carry. But the descendants of Kohath must not enter the Sacred Tent
\add at any other time\add* and look at the things that are in it. If they do that, I will get rid of all the descendants of
Kohath.” 
\s The work of the men descended from Gershon 
\p
\v 21 Yahweh also said to Moses/me, 
\v 22 “Write down the names of all the men who belong to the clans descended from Gershon.
\v 23 Write the names of the men who are between thirty and fifty years old. They will be men who will also do work at the
Sacred Tent. 
\p
\v 24 This is the work that they must do and the things that they must carry
\add when you move to a new location\add*: 
\v 25 They must carry the curtains of the Sacred Tent, they must carry the Sacred Tent and all the things that cover it,
including the nice outer covering made from skins of goats, and the curtain which is at the entrance of the Sacred Tent.
\v 26 They must also carry the curtains that form the wall that surrounds the courtyard that surrounds the Sacred Tent and the
altar, the curtain that is at the entrance to the courtyard, and the ropes
\add that fasten the curtains\add*. They must also do the packing and loading of these things.
\v 27 Aaron and his sons will supervise the work of all the descendants of Gershom. That work includes carrying those things
and doing other work that is necessary for moving them. They must tell each of the descendants of Gershom what things they must
carry. 
\v 28 Those are the tasks that you must give to the men who belong to the clans descended from Gershom. Aaron's son Ithamar is
the one who will supervise their work. 
\s The work of the men descended from Merari 
\p
\v 29 Count also the men who belong to the clans descended from Merari.
\v 30 Write the names of the men who are between thirty and fifty years old. They will be men who will also work at the Sacred
Tent. 
\v 31 Their work will be to carry the frames that hold up the tent, the crossbars, the posts
\add that hold up the curtains\add*, and the bases. 
\v 32 They must also carry the posts for \add the curtains that form the walls
of\add* the courtyard and the bases for the posts, the tent pegs, and the ropes
\add to fasten the curtains\add*. Tell each man what things he must carry.
\v 33 Those are the tasks that the descendants of Merari must do at the Sacred Tent. Aaron's son Ithamar is the one who will
supervise them.”
