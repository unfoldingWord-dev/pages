\c 19  
\s The ritual for removing the guilt of sin 
\p
\v 1 Yahweh said to Aaron and Moses/me, 
\v 2 “I am now giving to you another regulation. Tell the Israeli people to bring to you one reddish brown cow that has no
defects. It must be an animal that ◄has never been/no one has ever► used for plowing ground.
\v 3 Give it to Eleazar, the priest. He must take it outside the camp and slaughter it
\add and catch the blood in a basin\add*. 
\v 4 He must dip one of his fingers in the blood and sprinkle some of it seven times
\add on the ground\add* near the Sacred Tent. 
\v 5 Then, while Eleazar watches, the cow must be burned completely—its hide, its meat,
\add the rest of\add* its blood, and even its dung. 
\v 6 Eliezer then must take a stick of cedar wood, a stalk of \add a plant
named\add* hyssop, and some scarlet/red yarn, and throw them into the fire where the cow is burning.
\p
\v 7 Then the priest must wash his clothes and bathe. After doing that, he may return to the camp. But he will be unfit for
doing any sacred work until that evening. 
\v 8 The man who burns the cow must also wash his clothes and bathe, and he will also be unacceptable to me until that evening.
\p
\v 9 Then someone who has not become unacceptable to me must gather up the ashes of the cow and put them in a ◄sacred
place/place that is acceptable to me► outside the camp. The ashes must be kept there for the people of Israel to
\add use when they\add* mix it with water for the ritual to remove the guilt of sin.
\v 10 The man who gathers up the ashes of the cow must \add also\add* wash his clothes, and he
\add also\add* will be unfit to do anymore sacred work until that evening. That is a regulation that will never be changed. It
must be obeyed by you Israeli people and by any foreigners who live among you.
\p
\v 11 All those who touch a corpse will be unacceptable to me for seven days.
\v 12 On the third day and on the seventh day \add after touching a
corpse\add*, in order to become acceptable to me again, \add they must sprinkle on
themselves\add* some of that water for removing the guilt of their sin. If they do not do that on both of those days, they will
continue to be unacceptable to me. 
\v 13 All those who touch a corpse, and do not perform in the correct way the ritual to become acceptable to me again, defile
Yahweh's Sacred Tent. They will no longer belong to the Israeli people. The water to remove the guilt of sin was not sprinkled
on them, so they continue to be unacceptable to me. 
\p
\v 14 There is another ritual that must be performed when someone dies inside a tent. All those who were inside that tent when
that person died or who enter that tent will be unacceptable to me for seven days.
\v 15 Any jars that are inside that tent that are not covered are not permitted to be used.
\v 16 If someone who is out in a field touches the corpse of someone who was murdered, or who died from natural causes, or if
someone touches a bone from some human or touches a grave, that person will be unacceptable to me for seven days.
\p
\v 17 For someone like that to become acceptable to me again, some of the ashes from
\add the cow\add* that was burned must be taken and put in a jar. Then some fresh water must be poured over the ashes.
\v 18 Then someone who has not become unacceptable to God must take a stalk of
\add a plant named\add* hyssop and dip it into the water. Then that person must sprinkle some of the water on the tent where
that person died, on the things that are in the tent, and on the people who were in the tent. He must also sprinkle some of
that water on any person who touched a human bone or who touched a person who died, or who touched a grave.
\v 19 On the third day and on the seventh day after that, the person who is acceptable to me must sprinkle some of that water
on those who have become unacceptable to God. On the seventh day, the people who are performing that ritual to become
acceptable to me again must wash their clothes and bathe. If they do that, on that evening they will become acceptable to me
again. 
\p
\v 20 If those who have become unacceptable to me do not become acceptable to me again by doing this, they will no longer
belong to the Israeli people, because they have defiled my Sacred Tent. They did not sprinkle on themselves the water that
removes the guilt of their sins, so they remain unacceptable to me.
\v 21 That is a law for the Israeli people that will never be changed. Those who sprinkle that water on themselves must then
wash their clothes. And anyone who touches that water which removes guilt for sins will remain unacceptable to God until that
evening. 
\p
\v 22 Anything and any person whom someone who has become unacceptable to me has touched will remain unacceptable to me until
that evening.”
