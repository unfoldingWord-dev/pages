\c 14  
\s King Amaziah of Judah 
\p
\v 1 After Jehoash had been ruling Israel for almost two years, Joash's son Amaziah became the king of Judah.
\v 2 He was 25 years old when he started to rule, and he ruled in Jerusalem for 29 years. His mother was Jehoaddin; she was
from Jerusalem. 
\v 3 Amaziah did many things that pleased Yahweh, but he did not do as many things that pleased Yahweh as King David had done.
He did some of the good things that his father Joash had done. 
\v 4 But, \add like his father\add*, he did not tear down the places for worshipping Yahweh on the tops of hills. The people
continued to burn incense \add to honor Yahweh\add* on those hills
\add instead of in Jerusalem, the place that Yahweh had appointed\add*.
\p
\v 5 As soon as he was completely in control of his kingdom, he caused to be executed the officials who had murdered his
father. 
\v 6 But he did not execute their children. He obeyed what was written in the laws that God gave to Moses: “Parents must not be
executed for the \add crimes\f + \ft Or: sins \f* committed by\add* their children, and children must not be executed for
\add crimes\f + \ft Or: sins \f* committed by\add* their parents. People must be executed only for the sins that they themselves
\add have committed\add*.” 
\p
\v 7 Amaziah's soldiers killed ten thousand soldiers of the Edom people-group in the Valley of Salt
\add south of the Dead Sea\add*, and they captured Sela \add city\add* and gave it a new name, Joktheel. That is still its
name. 
\p
\v 8 Then Amaziah sent messengers to King Jehoash of Israel, saying “Come here and let's talk together.”
\p
\v 9 But King Jehoash replied this to King Amaziah: “Once a thornbush growing in
\add the mountains\add* in Lebanon sent a message to a cedar tree, saying, ‘Give your daughter to my son in order that he may
marry her.’ But a wild animal in Lebanon passed by the thornbush and trampled it.
\v 10  \add The meaning of what I am say is that\add* your army has defeated the army of Edom, so now you have become very
proud. But you should be content with defeating the people of Edom, and allow your soldiers to stay at home. If you cause
trouble \add by fighting against\add* us, you will surely \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* cause a disaster to happen to you and to your people.”
\p
\v 11 But Amaziah refused to heed Jehoash's message. So he marched with his army to fight against the Israeli army at
Beth-Shemesh \add city\add* in Judah. 
\v 12 The Israeli army defeated the army of Judah, and all the soldiers of Judah fled and ran back home.
\v 13 Jehoash's army also captured King Amaziah there, and they also marched to Jerusalem and tore down the wall
\add that was around\add* the city, from the Ephraim Gate to the Corner Gate. That was a section that was about 200
yards\f + \ft Or: meters \f* long. 
\v 14 Jehoash's soldiers seized all the gold and silver that they found, and all the utensils that were in the temple, and all
the valuable things that were in the palace, and took them to Samaria. They also took to Samaria some prisoners whom they had
captured. 
\p
\v 15  \add If you want to know about\add* all the other things that Jehoash did when he was king, including when he
\add and his army\add* fought against \add the army of\add* King Amaziah of Judah, they are written in the book named 'The
History of the Kings of Israel.' 
\v 16 Jehoash died \f + \ft euphemism \f*, and he was buried in Samaria, where the other kings of Israel had been buried. Then his son Jeroboam
\add #2\add* became the king. 
\p
\v 17 Amaziah, the king of Judah, lived for fifteen more years after Jehoash, the king of Israel, died.
\v 18  \add If you want to know more about everything else that Amaziah
did\add*, it is written \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* in the book named 'The History of the Kings of Judah.'
\p
\v 19 Some people in Jerusalem plotted against him, so he fled to Lachish
\add city\add*. But they followed him there and killed him. 
\v 20 They took his corpse back to Jerusalem and buried it where his ancestors had been buried, in the
\add part of Jerusalem called\add* 'the City of David.' 
\p
\v 21 Then all the people of Judah appointed Amaziah's son Uzziah, when he was sixteen years old, to be their king
\v 22 After Uzziah's father Amaziah died, Uzziah's workers captured Elath
\add city\add*, and it became under the control of Judah again. 
\s King Jeroboam \add #2\add* of Israel 
\p
\v 23 When Amaziah had been ruling Judah for almost fifteen years, Jeroboam
\add #2\add* became the king of Israel. He ruled in Samaria \add city\add* for forty-one years.
\v 24 He did many things that Yahweh said were evil. He did not stop committing the same kind of sins that Jeroboam, the son of
Nebat, committed, sins which induced the Israeli people to sin also.
\v 25 His soldiers conquered again some of the territory that had previously belonged to Israel, from Hamath
\add city\add* in the north to the Dead Sea in the south. That is what Yahweh, the God whom the Israelis worshiped, promised
the prophet Jonah, the son of Amittai, from Gath-Hepher \add town\add*, would happen.
\p
\v 26 That happened because Yahweh saw that the Israelis' \add enemies were
causing\add* the Israelis to suffer very much. And there was absolutely no one [IDI] who would help them.
\v 27 But Yahweh said that he would not destroy Israel completely, so he enabled King Jeroboam
\add #2\add* to rescue them. 
\p
\v 28  \add If you want to know more about\add* everything else that Jeroboam
\add #2\add* did, about his fighting courageously in battles, and about his
\add enabling the Israelis to\add* capture again Damascus and Hamath
\add cities\add*, they are written \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* in the book named 'The Book of he History of the Kings of Israel.'
\v 29 Jeroboam \add #2\add* died \f + \ft euphemism \f*, and \add was buried where\add* the other kings of Israel were buried, and his son
Zechariah became the king.
