\c 19  
\s Hezekiah consulted the prophet Isaiah 
\p
\v 1 When King Hezekiah heard what they reported, he tore his clothes and put on clothes made of rough cloth
\add because he was very distressed\add*. Then he went to the temple
\add to ask God what to do\add*. 
\v 2 Then he summoned Eliakim and Shebna and the ◄older/most important► priests, who were also wearing clothes made of rough
sackcloth, and told them to talk to me. 
\v 3 He said to them, “Tell this to Isaiah: King Hezekiah says that this is a day when we have great distress/trouble.
\add Other nations are causing\add* us to be insulted and disgraced. We are like \f + \fk metaphor \f* a woman who is about to give birth to a
child, but she does not have the strength that she needs to do it.
\v 4 Perhaps Yahweh our God has heard everything that the official from Assyria said. Perhaps he knows that His boss/master,
the king of Assyria, sent him to insult the all-powerful God, and that Yahweh will rebuke/punish him for what he said. And he
requests that you pray for the few of us who are still alive \add here in
Jerusalem\add*.” 
\p
\v 5 When the messengers from Hezekiah came to Isaiah, 
\v 6 Isaiah said to them, “\add Go back to\add* your boss/master and tell him, ‘This is what Yahweh says: Those messengers from
the king of Assyria have said evil things about me. But you should not be disturbed because of what they said.
\v 7 Listen to this: I will cause Sennacherib to hear a rumor that will worry him,
\add that the armies of Babylon are about to attack his country\add*. So he will return to his own country, and there I will
cause him to be assassinated by \add men using\add* swords.’ ” 
\p
\v 8 The official from Assyria found out that the King of Assyria
\add and his army\add* had left Lachish \add city\add*, and that they were attacking Libnah,
\add which is a nearby city\add*. So the official went there \add to report to him what had happened in
Jerusalem\add*. 
\p
\v 9 Soon after that, King Sennacherib received a report that King Tirhakah of Ethiopia was leading his army, was coming to
attack them. So before King Sennacherib left Libnah \add to fight against the army from
Ethiopia\add*, he sent other messengers to King Hezekiah with a letter.
\v 10  \add In the letter\add* he wrote this to Hezekiah: “Do not allow your god on whom you are relying to deceive you by
promising that the city of Jerusalem will not be captured by my army \f + \fk metonymy \f*.
\v 11 You have certainly heard what the armies of the kings of Assyria have done to all the other countries. Our armies have
completely destroyed them. So, ◄do you think that you will escape?/do not think that your god will save you!► \f + \fk rhetorical question \f*
\v 12 Did the gods of the nations that were about to be destroyed by the armies of the previous kings of Assyria rescue them?
Did those gods rescue the people in the Gozan region and in Haran and Rezeph
\add cities in northern Syria\add* and the people of Eden who had been ◄deported/forced to go► to Tel-Assar
\add city\add*? None of the gods of those cities were able to rescue them.
\v 13 What happened to the kings of Hamath and Arpad and Sepharvaim and Ivvah
\add cities\add* \f + \fk rhetorical question \f*? \add They are all dead, and their people were
deported\add*!” 
\s Hezekiah prayed 
\p
\v 14 Hezekiah received the letter that the messengers gave him, and he read it. Then he went up to the temple and spread out
the letter in front of Yahweh. 
\v 15 Then Hezekiah prayed this: “Yahweh, the God whom to whom we Israelis belong, you are seated on your throne above the
\add statues of\add* creatures with wings, \add above the Sacred
Chest\add*. Only you are truly God. You rule all the kingdoms on this earth. You are the one who created
\add everything on\add* the earth and in the sky. 
\v 16 So, Yahweh, please listen to what I am saying, and look at
\add what is happening\add*. And listen to what King Sennacherib has said to insult you, the all-powerful God.
\p
\v 17 Yahweh, it is true that the \add armies of\add* the kings of Assyria have completely destroyed many nations, and ruined
their land. 
\v 18 And they have thrown the idols of those nations into fires and burned them. But
\add that was not difficult to do, because\add* they were not gods. They were only statues made of wood and stone, idols that
were shaped by humans, \add and that is why they were destroyed easily\add*.
\v 19 So now, Yahweh our God, please rescue us from the power \f + \fk metonymy \f*
\add of the king of Assyria\add*, in order that the people in all the kingdoms of the world will know that you, Yahweh, are the
only one who is truly God.” 
\s Isaiah predicted that the Assyrians would not conquer Jerusalem
\p
\v 20 Then Isaiah sent this message to Hezekiah: “This is what Yahweh, the God to whom we Israelis belong, says: ‘I have heard
what you prayed to me about Sennacherib, the king of Assyria. 
\v 21 This is what I say to him: 
\p “The people of Jerusalem \f + \fk metonymy \f* despise you and make fun of you.
\p They wag/shake their heads to mock you while you flee from here.
\p
\v 22 Who do you think that you are despising and ridiculing? 
\p Who do you think you were shouting at? 
\p Who do you think you were looking at very proudly/arrogantly?
\p It was I, the holy God whom the Israelis worship. 
\p
\v 23 The messengers that you sent made fun of me. 
\p You said, ‘With my many chariots I have gone to the highest mountains,
\p even to the highest mountains in Lebanon. 
\p We have cut down its tallest cedar trees 
\p and its nicest pine/cyprus trees. 
\p We have been to the most distant/remote peaks 
\p and to its densess forests. 
\p
\v 24 We have dug wells in other countries and drank water from them.
\p And by marching through \f + \fk metonymy \f* the streams of Egypt, 
\p we dried them all up \f + \fk hyperbole \f*!’ ” 
\b
\p
\v 25  \add But I reply\add*, “Have you never heard that long ago I determined
\add that those things would happen\add*? 
\p I planned it long ago, 
\p and now I have been causing it to occur. 
\p I planned that your army \add the power to\add* capture many cities that were surrounded by high walls,
\p and cause them to become piles of rubble. 
\p
\v 26 The people who lived in those cities have no power, 
\p and as a result they became dismayed and discouraged. 
\p They are as frail as plants and grass in the fields, 
\p as frail as grass that grows on the roofs of houses 
\p and is scorched by the hot east wind. 
\b
\p
\v 27 But I know \add everything about you\add*. 
\p I know when you are in your house and when you go outside; 
\p I also know that you are ◄raging/speaking very angrily► against me.
\p
\v 28 So, because you have raged against me, 
\p and because I have heard \f + \fk metonymy \f* you speak very proudly/arrogantly,
\p \add it will be as though\add* I will put a hook in your nose
\p and I will pit an iron ◄bit/piece of metal► in your mouth \add in order that I can take you where I want you to
go\add*, 
\p and I will force you to return \add to your own country\add* 
\p on the same road on which you came here, \add without conquering
Jerusalem\add*.” 
\b
\p
\v 29 Then I said to Hezekiah, “This is what will happen to prove
\add that I am telling the truth\add*: 
\p This year and next year you \add and your people\add* will be able to harvest only ◄wild grain/grain that grows without
having been planted►. 
\p But the following year, you \add Israelis\add* will be able to plant grain and harvest it, and to plant vineyards and eat
the grapes. 
\p
\v 30 The people \f + \fk metonymy \f* in Judah who remain alive will prosper and have many children;
\p they will be like plants whose roots go deep down into the ground and which produce much \f + \fk metaphor \f*.
\p
\v 31 There will be many people in Jerusalem \f + \fk doublet \f* who will remain alive,
\p because I, Yahweh, the commander of the armies of angels in heaven, want \f + \fk personification \f* it to happen.”
\p
\v 32 So this is what I, Yahweh, say about the king of Assyria: 
\p “His armies will not enter this city; 
\p they will not even shoot any arrows into it! 
\p His soldiers will not \add march outside\add* the city gates carrying shields,
\p and they will not even build high mounds of dirt against \add the city
walls\add* 
\p \add to enable them to attack the city\add*. 
\p
\v 33 Their king will return to his own country 
\p on the same road on which he came here. 
\p He will not enter this city!” 
\p \add That will happen because\add* I, Yahweh, have said it! 
\p
\v 34 I will defend this city and prevent it from being destroyed.
\q2 I will do this for the sake of my own reputation and because of what I promised to King David, who served me well.’ ”
\b
\p
\v 35 That night, an angel from Yahweh went out to where the army of Assyria had put up their tents, and killed 185,000 of
their soldiers! When rest of then soldiers woke up the next morning, they saw that there were corpses everywhere!
\v 36 Then King Sennacherib left and went home to Nineveh, \add the capital of
Assyria\add*. 
\p
\v 37 One day, when he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch, his two sons, Adrammelech and Sharezer, killed him with
their swords. Then they escaped and went to the Ararat \add region, northwest of
Nineveh\add*. And another of Sennacherib's sons, Esarhaddon, became the king of Assyria.
