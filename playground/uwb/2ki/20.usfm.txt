\s Hezekiah's sickness and his recovery 
\p
\v 1 About that time, Hezekiah became very ill. \add He thought that
he\add* was about to die. Isaiah the prophet came to him and said, “This is what Yahweh says: ‘You should tell the people in
your palace what you want them to do after you die, because you are not going to recover from this illness. You are going to
die.’ ” 
\p
\v 2 Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall and prayed this: 
\v 3 “Yahweh, do not forget that I have always served you faithfully with all my inner being, and I have done things that
pleased you.” Then Hezekiah started to cry loudly. 
\p
\v 4 Isaiah left the king, but before he had crossed the middle courtyard of the palace, Yahweh gave him a message.
\v 5 He said, “Go back to Hezekiah, the ruler of my people, and say to him, ‘I, Yahweh, the God whom your ancestor King David
\add worshiped\add*, have heard what you prayed. And I have seen your tears. So, listen: I will heal you. Two days from now you
will \add be able to\add* go up to my temple. 
\v 6 I will enable you to live for fifteen more years. And I will rescue you and this city again from the power \f + \fr metonymy \f* of the
king of Assyria. I will defend this city for the sake of my own reputation and because of what I promised King David, who
served me \add well\add*.’ ” 
\p
\v 7 So Isaiah \add returned to the palace and told Hezekiah what Yahweh had said. Then he said to Hezekiah's
servants\add*, “Bring a paste made of boiled figs. Put some of it on his boil, and he will get well.”
\p
\v 8 Then Hezekiah replied to Isaiah, “What will Yahweh do to prove that he will heal me and that two days from now I will be
able to go up to the temple?” 
\p
\v 9 Isaiah replied, “Yahweh will do something that will prove to you that he will do what he promised. Do you want him to
cause the shadow on the stairway/sundial to go back ten steps/degrees, or to go forward ten steps/degrees?”
\p
\v 10 Hezekiah replied, “It is easy to cause the shadow to move forward,
\add because that is what it always does\add*. Tell him to cause it to move backward ten steps/degrees.”
\p
\v 11 So Isaiah prayed earnestly to Yahweh, and Yahweh caused the shadow to go backward ten steps/degrees on the
stairway/sundial that King Ahaz had made (OR, that workers had built for King Ahaz).
\s The messengers from the king of Babylonia 
\p
\v 12 At that time, King Merodach-Baladan, the son of Baladan the
\add previous\add* king of Babylonia, heard a report that King Hezekiah had been very sick. So he wrote some letters and gave
them to some messengers to take to Hezekiah, along with a gift. 
\v 13  \add When the messengers arrived\add*, Hezekiah welcomed them gladly. Then he showed them everything that was in his
◄treasure houses/places where very valuable things were stored► —the silver and gold, the spices, the nice-smelling olive oil,
and all the weapons \add for his soldiers\add*. There were no \add valuable\add* things in his storerooms or anywhere else in
his kingdom \f + \fr hyperbole \f* that he did not show them. 
\p
\v 14 Then the prophet Isaiah went to Hezekiah and asked him, “Where did those men come from, and what did they say to you?”
\p Hezekiah replied, “They came from a country very far from here. They came from Babylonia.”
\p
\v 15 Isaiah asked, “What did they see in your palace?” 
\p Hezekiah replied, “They saw everything. I showed them absolutely everything that I own—all my valuable things.”
\p
\v 16  \add Isaiah knew that Hezekiah had done a very foolish thing\add*. So Isaiah said to him, “Listen to what Yahweh says to
you. 
\v 17 There will be a time when everything that is still in your palace, all the valuable things that were put there by you and
your ancestors, will be carried away to Babylon. There will be nothing left here! That is what Yahweh says to you!
\v 18 Furthermore, some of your own descendants will be forced to go there, and they will be castrated in order that they may
become servants in the palace of the king of Babylon.” 
\p
\v 19 Then Hezekiah replied to Isaiah, “That message from Yahweh that you have given to me is good.” He said that because he
was thinking, “Even if that happens, there will be peace and security
\add in Israel\add* all during the remaining time that I remain alive.”
\p
\v 20  \add If you want to know more about\add* \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* all the other things that Hezekiah did, about his brave deeds in battle,
about his ordering a reservoir to be built in the city and a tunnel
\add to be dug\add* to bring water into the reservoir, they are all written in the book named 'The History of the Kings of
Judah.' 
\v 21 Later Hezekiah died \f + \fr euphemism \f*, and his son Manasseh became the king.
