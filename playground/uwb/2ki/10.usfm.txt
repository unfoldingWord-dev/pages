\s Ahab's descendants were murdered 
\p
\v 1 There were seventy descendants of King Ahab who were living there in Samaria. Jehu wrote a letter
\add and made copies of it and\add* sent them to the rulers of the city, to the elders, and to those who raised and tutored
Ahab's children. 
\v 2  \add This is what he wrote:\add* “You are the ones who are
\add taking care of\add* the king's descendants. You have chariots and horses and weapons, and you live in cities that have
walls around them. So as soon as you receive this letter, 
\v 3 choose one of the king's descendants, the one who is the best qualified, and appoint him to be your king. Then
\add prepare to\add* fight to defend him.” 
\p
\v 4 But \add when they got those letters and read them\add*, they became very afraid. They said, “King Joram and King Ahaziah
could not resist him; ◄how can we resist him?/we cannot possibly resist him!►” \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*
\p
\v 5 So the officer who was in charge of the palace and the mayor of the city sent a message to Jehu saying, “We want to serve
you, and we are ready to do whatever you tell us to do. We will not appoint anyone to become our king. You do whatever you
think is the best.” 
\p
\v 6 So Jehu sent a second letter to them, writing this: “If you ◄are on my side/want to help me►, and if you are ready to obey
me, \add kill King Ahab's descendants and cut off\add* their heads and bring their heads to me here in Jezreel at this time
tomorrow.” 
\p The seventy descendants of King Ahab were being brought up and supervised by the leaders of
\add Samaria\add* city. 
\v 7 When they received the letter from Jehu, they killed all seventy of Ahab's descendants and
\add cut off their heads\add*. They put their heads in baskets and sent them to Jehu at Jezreel.
\v 8 A messenger came to Jehu and told him, “They have brought the heads of Ahab's descendants.” So Jehu commanded that the
heads should be put in two piles at the city gate and that the heads should stay there until the next morning.
\p
\v 9 The next morning he went out \add to the city gate\add* and said to all the people, “I am the one who plotted against King
Joram and killed him. You are not guilty of doing that. But \add it was Yahweh, not
I\add* \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* \add who commanded that\add* all these \add descendants of
Ahab\add* should be killed. 
\v 10 So you need to know that everything that Yahweh said would happen has happened. He has caused to happen what he told the
prophet Elijah would happen.” 
\v 11 Then Jehu executed all the other relatives of Ahab in Jezreel, and all Ahab's officers, and close friends, and his
priests. He did not allow any of them to remain alive. 
\p
\v 12 Then Jehu left \add Jezreel\add* and went toward Samaria. While he was going there, at a place called 'Shepherds' Camp,'
\v 13 he met some relatives of King Ahaziah of Judah. He asked them, “Who are you?”
\p They replied, “We are relatives of King Ahaziah. We are going to Jezreel to visit the children of Queen Jezebel and the
other members of King \add Joram's\add* family.” 
\p
\v 14 Jehu said to his men, “Seize them!” So they seized them and killed all of them at the pit named Beth-Eked. There were
forty-two people whom they killed; they did not allow any of them to remain alive.
\p
\v 15 Then Jehu \add continued to travel toward Samaria\add*. Along the road, he was met by Jonadab, a leader of the Rechab
clan. Jehu greeted him and said to him, “Are you as devoted to me [IDI] as I am devoted to you?”
\p Jonadab replied, “Yes, I am.” 
\p Jehu said, “If you are, shake hands with me.” So Jonadab shook hands with him, and Jehu helped him to get into his chariot.
\v 16 Jehu said to him, “Come with me, and you will see that I am very dedicated to Yahweh.” So they rode together to Samaria.
\p
\v 17 When they arrived in Samaria, Jehu killed all of Ahab's relatives who were still alive. He did not ◄spare any of
them/allow any of them to remain alive►. That was what Yahweh told Elijah would happen.
\s The people who worshiped Baal were killed 
\p
\v 18 Then Jehu summoned all the people \add of Samaria\add*, and said to them, “King Ahab was devoted to
\add your god\add* Baal a little bit, but I will serve him much more.
\v 19 So now summon all the prophets of Baal, all of Baal's priests, and all the others who worship Baal. I am going to make a
great sacrifice to Baal. I want all of them to be there. Any of them who is not there will be executed.” But Jehu was planning
to trick them; he was planning to kill all those who worshiped Baal.
\p
\v 20 Then Jehu commanded, “Announce that we are going to set aside a day to honor Baal.” So they did that.
\v 21 Jehu \add decided what day they would gather\add* and sent messages throughout Israel
\add telling everyone what day to gather\add*, and on that day, everyone who worshiped Baal came. No one stayed at home. They
all went into the huge temple of Baal and filled it from one end to the other.
\v 22 Jehu told the priest who took care of the sacred robes to bring them out and give them to the people who worshiped Baal.
So the priest did that. 
\p
\v 23 Then Jehu went into the temple of Baal with Jonadab, and he said to the people who were there to worship Baal, “Be sure
that only those who worship Baal are here. Be sure that no one who worships Yahweh has come in.”
\v 24 Then he and Jonadab prepared to offer sacrifices and other offerings to Baal that would be completely burned
\add on the altar that was there in Samaria\add*. But Jehu had stationed eighty of his men outside the temple, and had said to
them, “I want you to kill all the people \add who are in the temple\add*. Anyone who allows one of them to escape will be
executed!” 
\p
\v 25 As soon as Jehu \add and Jonadab\add* had finished killing the animals that would be completely burned to be an offering
to Baal, \add they went outside and\add* said to the guards and officers, “Go in and kill all of them! Do not allow any of them
to escape!” So the guards and officers went in and killed them all with their swords. Then they dragged their corpses outside
the temple. Then they went into the inner room of the temple, 
\v 26 and they carried out the sacred pillar of Baal that was there, and they burned it.
\v 27 So they destroyed that pillar that honored Baal, and then they burned down the temple, and made it a latrine. And it is
still a latrine! 
\p
\v 28 That is how Jehu got rid of the worship of Baal in Israel.
\v 29 But Jehu did not quit committing the kinds of sins that Jeroboam had committed, sins that induced the people of Israel to
sin by worshiping the gold \add statues of\add* calves in Bethel and Dan
\add cities\add*. 
\p
\v 30 Then Yahweh said to Jehu, “You have done what pleased me by getting rid of all of Ahab's descendants. So I promise you
that your son and grandson and great-grandson and great-great-grandson will all be kings of Israel.”
\v 31 But Jehu did not obey all the laws of Yahweh, the God of the Israeli people. He did not stop committing the sins that
Jeroboam had committed, sins that induced the Israeli people to sin.
\s Jehu died 
\p
\v 32 At that time, Yahweh began to cause the territory controlled by Israel to become smaller.
\add The army of\add* King Hazael \add of Syria\add* conquered much of the Israeli territory.
\v 33 He conquered the parts east of the Jordan \add River\add*, as far south as Aroer
\add town\add* on the Arnon \add River\add*. That included the Gilead and Bashan
\add regions\add*, where the tribes of Gad, Reuben, and half of the tribe of Manasseh lived.
\p
\v 34  \add If you want to read more\add* about all the other things that Jehu did \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*, they are written in the book named
'The Book of the History of the Kings of Israel.' 
\p
\v 35 Jehu died \f + \fr euphemism \f*, and was buried in Samaria. His son Jehoahaz became the king in place of his father.
\v 36 Jehu had ruled in Samaria as the king of Israel for twenty-eight years.
