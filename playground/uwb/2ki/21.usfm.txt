\c 21  
\s King Manasseh of Judah 
\p
\v 1 Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to rule. He ruled Judah for 55 years from Jerusalem. His mother was Hephzibah.
\v 2 He did many things that Yahweh said were evil. He imitated the disgusting things that were formerly done by the people of
the nations that Yahweh had expelled from the land of Israel as his people advanced
\add through the land\add*. 
\v 3 He commanded his workers to rebuild the shrines \add for worshiping
Yahweh\add* that his father Hezekiah had destroyed \add because they were not in the place that Yahweh had said they should
worship him\add*. He directed his workers to build altars for worshiping Baal. He made
\add a statue of the goddess\add* Asherah, like Ahab the king of Israel had done
\add previously\add*. And Manasseh worshiped \f + \ft doublet \f* the stars. 
\v 4 He directed his workers to build altars \add for worshiping foreign
gods\add* in the temple of Yahweh, about which Yahweh had said, "It is here in Jerusalem where I want people to worship \f + \ft metonymy \f*
me, forever." 
\v 5 He directed that altars for worshiping the stars be built in both of the courtyards outside the temple.
\v 6 He even sacrificed his own son and burned \add in a fire\add*. He performed rituals to practice sorcery and magic rituals.
He also went to people who consulted the spirits of dead people to find out what would happen in the future. He did many things
that Yahweh said are extremely evil, things that caused Yahweh to become very angry.
\p
\v 7 He placed the statue of the goddess Asherah in the temple, the place about which Yahweh had said to David and his son
Solomon, "My temple will be here in Jerusalem. This is the city that I have chosen from all the territory of the twelve tribes
of Israel, where I want people to worship me, forever. 
\v 8 And if the Israeli people obey all my commands and all the laws that I gave to Moses, the man who served me
\add very well\add*, I will not again force them to leave this land that I gave to their ancestors."
\v 9 But the people did not heed Yahweh. And Manasseh persuaded them to commit sins that are more evil than the sins that were
committed by the people of the nations that Yahweh had expelled from the land as the Israeli people advanced.
\p
\v 10  \add These are some of the things that\add* the prophets said many times, messages that Yahweh had given them:
\v 11 "Manasseh, the king of Judah, has done these abominable things, things that are much worse than the things that the Amor
people-group did in this land long ago. He has persuaded the people of Judah to sin by
\add worshiping\add* idols. 
\v 12 Therefore, this is what I, Yahweh, the God whom you Israeli people worship, say: 'I will cause disaster to come to
Jerusalem and the rest of Judah. It will be terrible, with the result that everyone who hears about it will be stunned \f + \ft metonymy \f*.
\v 13 I will judge and punish \f + \ft metaphor \f* the people of Jerusalem like I punished the family of King Ahab
\add of Israel\add*. I will wipe Jerusalem clean\f + \ft Or: remove all the people from Jerusalem \f*, like \f + \ft metaphor \f* people wipe a plate and
then turn it upside down \add to show that they are now satisfied\add*.
\v 14 And I will abandon the people who remain alive, and I will allow their enemies to conquer them and steal everything
valuable from their land. 
\v 15 I will do this because my people have done things that I say are very evil, things which have caused me to become very
angry. They have caused me to become angry continually, ever since the time that their ancestors left Egypt.'Â "
\p
\v 16 Manasseh \add commanded his officials\add* to kill many innocent people in Jerusalem, with the result that their blood
flowed in the streets. He did this in addition to persuading the people of Judah to sin against Yahweh
\add by worshiping idols\add*. 
\p
\v 17  \add If you want to know more about\add* all the things that Manasseh did, they are written in the book named 'The
History of the Kings of Judah.' 
\v 18 Manasseh died \f + \ft euphemism \f* and was buried in the garden outside his palace, the garden that Uzza
\add had made\add*. Then his son Amon became the king. 
\s King Amon of Judah 
\p
\v 19 Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king. He ruled Judah from Jerusalem for only two years. His mother's name
was Meshullemeth. She was from Jotbah \add town\add*, and was the granddaughter of Haruz.
\v 20 He did many things that Yahweh said were evil, like his father Manasseh had done.
\v 21 He imitated the behavior of his father, and he worshiped the same idols that his father had worshiped \f + \ft doublet \f*.
\v 22 He abandoned Yahweh, the God whom his ancestors had \add worshiped\add*, and did not behave as Yahweh wanted him to.
\v 23 Then one day some of his officials made plans to kill him. They assassinated him in the palace.
\p
\v 24 But then the people of Judah killed all those who had assassinated King Amon, and they appointed his son Josiah to be
their king. 
\p
\v 25  \add If you want to read about\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* the other things that Amon did, they are written in the book named 'The
History of the Kings of Judah.' 
\v 26 Amon was also buried in the tomb in the garden that Uzza \add had
made\add*. Then his son Josiah became the king.
