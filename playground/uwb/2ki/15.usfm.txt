\s King Uzziah of Judah 
\p
\v 1 After Jeroboam \add #2\add* had been ruling Israel for almost twenty-seven years, Uzziah, the son of King Amaziah of
Judah, began to rule. 
\v 2 He was sixteen years old when he started to rule, and he ruled in Jerusalem for fifty-two years. His mother was Jecoliah,
from Jerusalem. 
\v 3 He did things that Yahweh was pleased with, like his father Amaziah had done.
\v 4 But, the places on the tops of the hills where they worshiped Yahweh were not destroyed, and the people continued to burn
incense \add to honor Yahweh\add* at those places \add instead of in Jerusalem, the place that Yahweh had
appointed\add*. 
\p
\v 5 Yahweh caused Uzziah to become a leper, and he was a leper all the remaining years that he lived.
\add He was not allowed to live in the palace\add*. He lived alone in a house, and his son Jotham ruled the country.
\p
\v 6  \add If you want to know about\add* everything else that Uzziah did, it is written \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* in the book named 'The History
of the Kings of Judah.' 
\v 7 Uzziah died \f + \fk euphemism \f*, and they buried him in \add the part of Jerusalem
called\add* 'the City of David,' where his ancestors had been buried. Then his son Jotham became the king.
\s King Zechariah of Israel 
\p
\v 8 After Uzziah had been ruling Judah for almost thirty-eight years, Zechariah, the son of Jeroboam
\add #2\add*, became the king of Israel. He ruled in Samaria \add city\add* for
\add only\add* six months. 
\v 9 He did many things that Yahweh said were evil, like his ancestors had done. He committed the same kind of sins that
Jeroboam \add #1\add* had committed, sins which induced the Israeli people to sin.
\p
\v 10 Then Shallum, the son of Jabesh, made plans to assassinate Zechariah. He killed him at Ibleam
\add town\add*, and then he became the king. 
\v 11 Everything else that Zechariah did is written in the book named 'The History of the Kings of Israel.'
\v 12 When Zechariah died, \add that ended the dynasty of King Jehu\add*. That fulfilled what Yahweh said to King Jehu would
happen: “Your son and grandson and great-grandson and great-great-grandson will all be kings of Israel.”
\s King Shallum of Israel 
\p
\v 13 Shallum, the son of Jabesh, became the king of Israel after King Uzziah had been ruling Judah for almost thirty-nine
years. But Shallum ruled in Samaria for only one month. 
\v 14 Then Menahem, the son of Gadi, went up from Tirzah \add city\add* to Samaria and assassinated Shallum. Then Menahem
became the king of Israel. 
\p
\v 15 Everything else that Shallum did, including his killing King Zechariah, is written in the book named 'The History of the
Kings of Israel.' 
\p
\v 16 While Menahem was ruling in Samaria, he completely destroyed Tappuah
\add village south of Samaria\add* and killed all the people who lived there and in the surrounding territory. He did that
because the people in the city refused to surrender to him. \add With his
sword\add* he even ripped open the bellies of pregnant women. 
\s King Menahem of Israel 
\p
\v 17 When King Azariah had been ruling Judah for almost thirty-nine years, Menahem, the son of Gadi, became the king of
Israel. He ruled in Samaria for ten years. 
\v 18 He did many things that Yahweh said were evil. He committed the same kind of sins that King Jeroboam
\add #1\add* had committed, sins that induced the people of Israel to sin. He continued to commit those sins all during the
years that he lived. 
\p
\v 19 Then King Tiglath-Pileser of Assyria came \add with his army\add* to attack Israel. So Menahem gave him ◄thirty-eight
tons/35,000 kg.► of silver in order that Tiglath-Pileser would help Menahem to continue to be king and rule his country more
strongly. 
\v 20 Menahem obtained that money from the rich men in Israel. He compelled each of them to contribute fifty pieces of silver.
So Tiglath-Pileser \add took that money and\add* went back home.
\p
\v 21  \add If you want to know more about\add* everything that Menahem did, it is written \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* in the book named 'The history
of the Kings of Israel.' 
\v 22 Menahem died \f + \fk euphemism \f* and was buried, and his son Pekahiah became the king of Israel.
\s King Pekahiah of Israel 
\p
\v 23 When King Uzziah had been ruling Judah for almost fifty years, Menahem's son Pekahiah became the king of Israel. He ruled
in Samaria for \add only\add* two years. 
\v 24 He did many things that Yahweh said were evil. He committed the same kind of sins that King Jeroboam
\add #1\add* had committed, sins which induced the people of Israel to sin.
\v 25 Then one of Pekahiah's army commanders whose name was Pekah, the son of Remaliah, planned with fifty men from the Gilead
\add region\add* to kill Pekahiah. They assassinated him in a fortified place in the king's palace in Samaria. Then Pekah
became the king. 
\p
\v 26 Everything else that Pekahiah did is written in the book named 'The History of the Kings of Israel.'
\s King Pekah of Israel 
\p
\v 27 When King Uzziah had been ruling Judah for almost 52 years, Pekah, the son of Remaliah, became the king of Israel. He
ruled in Samaria for twenty years. 
\v 28 He also did many things that Yahweh said were evil. He committed the same kind of sins that King Jeroboam
\add #1\add* had committed, sins that induced the people of Israel to sin.
\p
\v 29 While Pekah was the king, Tiglath-Pileser, the king of Assyria, came
\add with his army and\add* captured \add the cities of\add* Ijon, Abel-Beth-Maacah, Janoah, Kedesh, Hazor, and
\add the regions of\add* Gilead, Galilee, and Naphtali. His army forced the Israeli people to leave their country and go to
live in Assyria. 
\p
\v 30 Then Hoshea, the son of Elah, planned to kill Pekah. He assassinated him when Uzziah's son Jotham had been ruling Judah
for almost twenty years. Then Hoshea became the king of Israel. 
\p
\v 31 Everything else that Pekah did is written in the book named 'The History of the Kings of Israel.'
\s King Jotham of Judah 
\p
\v 32 When Pekah had been ruling Israel for almost two years, Uzziah's son Jotham began to rule Judah.
\v 33 He was 25 years old when he started to rule, and he ruled from Jerusalem for sixteen years. His mother was Jerusha, the
daughter of Zadok. 
\v 34 He did many things that pleased Yahweh, like his father Uzziah had done.
\v 35 But he did not destroy the places on the tops of hills where the people worshiped Yahweh, and the people continued to
burn incense there \add to honor Yahweh\add*. Jotham's workers built the Upper Gate of the temple.
\p
\v 36  \add If you want to know more about\add* everything else that Jotham did, it is written \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* in the book named 'The
History of the Kings of Judah.' 
\v 37 It was during the time that Jotham was the king that Yahweh sent King Rezin of Syria and King Pekah of Israel
\add with their armies\add* to attack Judah. 
\v 38 Jotham died \f + \fk euphemism \f* and was buried where his ancestors had been buried in
\add the part of Jerusalem called\add* 'the City of David.' Then his son Ahaz became the king of Judah.
