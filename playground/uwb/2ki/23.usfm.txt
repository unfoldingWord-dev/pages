\c 23  
\s Josiah got rid of pagan worship 
\p
\v 1 Then the king summoned all the elders of Jerusalem and \add of the other places
in\add* Judah. 
\v 2 They went together to the temple, along with the priests and the prophets, and many other \f + \fk hyperbole \f* people, from the most
important people to the least important people. And while they listened, the king read to them all of the laws that Moses had
written. He read from the scroll that had been found in the temple.
\v 3 Then the king stood next to the pillar \add where the kings stood when they made important
announcements\add*, and while Yahweh was listening, he repeated his promise to sincerely obey with his inner being \f + \fk doublet \f* all of
Yahweh's commands and regulations \f + \fk doublet \f* He also promised to ◄fulfill the conditions of/do what was written in► the agreement.
And all the people also promised to obey the agreement. 
\p
\v 4 Then the king commanded Hilkiah the Supreme Priest and all the other priests who assisted him and the men who guarded the
entrance to the temple to bring out from the temple all the items that people had been using to worship Baal, the goddess
Asherah, and the stars. \add After they carried them out\add*, they burned all those things outside the city near the Kidron
Valley. Then they took all the ashes to Bethel, \add because that city was already considered to be
desecrated/unholy\add*. 
\v 5 There were many pagan priests that the previous kings of Judah had appointed to burn incense on the altars on the tops of
hills in Judah. They had been offering sacrifices to Baal, to the sun, the moon, the planets, and the stars. The king stopped
them from doing those things. 
\v 6 He \add commanded that\add* the statue of the goddess Asherah be taken out of the temple. Then they took it outside
Jerusalem, down to the Kidron Brook, and burned it. Then they pounded the ashes to powder and scattered that over the graves in
the public cemetery. 
\v 7 He also destroyed the rooms in the temple where the temple male prostitutes lived. That was where women wove robes that
were used to worship the goddess Asherah. 
\p
\v 8-9 Josiah also brought \add to Jerusalem\add* all the priests who were offering sacrifices in the other cities of Judah. He
also desecrated the places on the tops of hills where the priests had burned incense
\add to honor idols\add*, from Geba \add in the north\add* to Beersheba
\add in the south\add*. Those priests were not allowed to offer sacrifices in the temple, but they
\add were allowed to\add* eat the unleavened bread that the priests
\add who worked in the temple\add* ate. He also \add commanded that\add* the altars that were dedicated to the goat demons near
the gate built by Joshua, the mayor of Jerusalem, be destroyed. Those altars were at the left of the main gate into the city.
\p
\v 10 Josiah also desecrated the place named Topheth, in the Hinnom Valley, in order that no one could offer his son or
daughter there to be completely burned \add on the altar\add* for a sacrifice to
\add the god\add* Molech. 
\v 11 He also removed the horses that the \add previous\add* kings of Judah had dedicated to worshiping the sun, and he burned
the chariots that were used in that worship. Those horses and chariots were kept in the courtyard outside the temple, near the
entrance to the temple, and near the room where \add one of Josiah's\add* officials whose name was Nathan-Melech lived.
\p
\v 12 Josiah also commanded his servants to tear down the altars that the previous kings of Judah had built on the roof of the
palace, above the room where King Ahaz had stayed. They also tore down the altars that had been built by King Manasseh in the
two courtyards outside the temple. He commanded that they be smashed to pieces and thrown down into the Kidron Valley.
\v 13 He also commanded that the altars that King Solomon had built east of Jerusalem, south of Olive Tree Hill, be desecrated.
Solomon had built them for the worship of the disgusting idols—the
\add statue of the goddess\add* Astarte \add worshiped by the people
in\add* Sidon \add city\add*, Chemosh the god of the Moab people-group, and Molech the god of the Ammon people-group.
\v 14 They also broke into pieces the stone pillars that the Israeli people worshiped, and cut down the
\add pillars that honored the goddess\add* Asherah, and they scattered the ground there with human bones
\add to desecrate it\add*. 
\p
\v 15 Furthermore, he commanded them to tear down the place of worship at Bethel which had been built by King Jeroboam
\add #1\add*, the king who persuaded the people of Israel to sin. They tore down the altar. Then they broke its stones into
pieces and pounded them to become powder. They also burned the statue
\add of the goddess\add* Asherah. 
\v 16 Then Josiah looked around and saw some tombs there on the hill. He commanded his men to take the bones out of those tombs
and burn them on the altar. By doing that, he desecrated the altar. That was what a prophet had predicted many years before
when Jeroboam \add #1\add* was standing close to that altar at a festival.
\p Then Josiah looked up and saw the tomb of the prophet who had predicted that.
\p
\v 17 Josiah asked, “Whose tomb is that?” The people of Bethel replied, “It is the tomb of the prophet who came from Judah and
predicted that these things that you have just now done to this altar would happen.”
\p
\v 18 Josiah replied, “Allow his tomb to remain as it is. Do not remove the prophet's bones from the tomb.”
\p So the people did not remove those bones, or the bones of the other prophet, the one who had come from Samaria.
\p
\v 19 In every city in Israel, at Josiah's command, they tore down the shrines that had been built by the previous kings of
Israel, which had caused Yahweh to become very angry. He did to all those shrines/altars the same thing that he had done to the
altars at Bethel. 
\v 20 He ordered that all the priests who offered sacrifices on the altars on the tops of hills to be killed on those altars.
Then he burned human bones on every one of those altars \add to desecrate
them\add*. Then he returned to Jerusalem. 
\s Josiah had them celebrate the Passover 
\p
\v 21 Then the king commanded all the people to celebrate the Passover festival to honor Yahweh their God, which was written in
the law of Moses that they should do \add every year\add*. 
\v 22 During all the years that leaders ruled Israel and during all the years that kings had ruled Israel and Judah, they had
not celebrated that festival. 
\v 23 But now, after Josiah had been ruling for almost eighteen years, to
\add honor\add* Yahweh they celebrated the Passover festival in Jerusalem.
\s Other things that Josiah changed 
\p
\v 24 Furthermore, Josiah wiped out of Jerusalem and other places in Judah all the people who practiced sorcery and those who
requested the spirits of dead people \add to tell them what they should
do\add*. He also removed from Jerusalem and from the other places in Judah all the household idols and all the other idols and
abominable things. He did those things in order to obey what had been written in the scroll that Hilkiah had found in the
temple. 
\v 25 Josiah was devoted to Yahweh with all that he felt and thought and with all his strength. There had never been
\add in Judah or Israel\add* a king like him. He obeyed all the laws of Moses. And there has never since then been a king like
Josiah. 
\p
\v 26 But Yahweh had become extremely angry with the people of Judah because of all the things that
\add King\add* Manasseh had done to irritate him, and he continued to be very angry.
\v 27 He said, “I will do to Judah what I have done to Israel. I will banish the people of Judah, with the result that they
will never enter my presence again. And I will reject Jerusalem, the city that I chose
\add to belong to me\add*, and I will reject the temple, the place where I said that I \f + \fk metonymy \f* should be worshiped.”
\s The end of Josiah's rule of Judah 
\p
\v 28  \add If you want to know more about\add* \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* all the other things that Josiah did, they are written in the book named
'The History of the Kings of Judah.' 
\p
\v 29 While he was the king of Judah, King Neco of Egypt led his army north to the Euphrates River to help the king of Assyria.
King Josiah tried to stop the army of Egypt at Megiddo \add city\add*, but Josiah was killed in a battle there.
\v 30 His officials placed his corpse in a chariot and took it back to Jerusalem, where it was buried in his own tomb, a tomb
where the other previous kings had not been buried. 
\p Then the people of Judah poured \add olive\add* oil on Josiah's son Joahaz, to appoint him to be the new king.
\s King Joahaz of Judah 
\p
\v 31 Joahaz was 23 years old when he became the king \add of Judah\add*, but he ruled from Jerusalem for
\add only\add* three months. His mother was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah from Libnah
\add city\add*. 
\v 32 Joahaz did many things that Yahweh said were evil, just like many of his ancestors had done.
\v 33 King Neco's \add army captured him and\add* tied him up with chains and took him as a prisoner to Riblah
\add town\add* in Hamath \add district\add*, to prevent him from continuing to rule in Jerusalem. Neco forced the people of
Judah to pay to him ◄7,500 pounds/3,400 kg.► of silver and ◄75 pounds/34 kg.► of gold.
\v 34 King Neco appointed another son of Josiah, Eliakim, to be the new king, and he changed Eliakim's name to Jehoiakim. Then
he took Joahaz to Egypt, and later Joahaz died there in Egypt. 
\s King Jehoiakim of Judah 
\p
\v 35 King Jehoiakim collected a tax from the people \add of Judah\add*. He collected more from the rich people and less from
the poor people. He collected silver and gold from them, in order to pay to the king of Egypt what he commanded them to give.
\p
\v 36 Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he became the king
\add of Judah\add*, and he ruled from Jerusalem for eleven years. His mother was Zebidah, the daughter of Pedaiah from Rumah
\add town\add*. 
\v 37 He did many things that Yahweh says are evil, like his ancestors had done.
