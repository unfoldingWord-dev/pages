\s Elijah is taken up to heaven 
\p
\v 1 When Yahweh was about to take \add the prophet\add* Elijah up to heaven in a ◄whirlwind/twisting wind►, Elijah and
\add his fellow prophet\add* Elisha were traveling \add south\add* from Gilgal
\add town\add*. 
\v 2 Elijah said to Elisha, “Stay here, because Yahweh has told \add only\add* me to go to Bethel
\add town\add*.” 
\p But Elisha replied, “Just as certainly as Yahweh lives and you live, I will not leave you!”
\p So they went down \add together\add* to Bethel. 
\v 3 A group of prophets came to Elisha \add and Elijah before they entered the
town\add*, and they asked Elisha, “Do you know that Yahweh is going to take your master/boss
\add Elijah\add* away from you today?” 
\p Elisha answered, “Certainly I know that, but don't talk about it!” [IDI]
\v 4 Then Elijah said to Elisha, “Stay here, because Yahweh has told
\add only\add* me to go to Jericho.” 
\p But Elisha replied \add again\add*, “Just as certainly as Yahweh lives and you live, I will not leave you!”
\p So they went \add together\add* to Jericho \add city\add*. 
\p
\v 5  \add As they neared\add* Jericho, a group of prophets who were from there came to Elisha and said to him, “Do you know
that Yahweh is going to take your master/boss \add Elijah\add* away from you today?”
\p He answered again, “Certainly I know that, but don't talk about it!” [IDI]
\p
\v 6 Then Elijah said to Elisha, “Stay here, because Yahweh has told
\add only\add* me to go to the Jordan \add River\add*.” 
\p But \add again\add* Elisha replied, “As certainly as Yahweh lives and you live, I will not leave you!”
\p So they continued walking together. 
\v 7 Fifty men from the group of prophets \add who were from Jericho\add* also went, but they watched from a distance as Elijah
and Elisha stopped at the edge of the Jordan \add River\add*. 
\v 8 Then Elijah rolled up his cloak and struck the water with it. A path opened up for them through the river, and they walked
across \add as though they were\add* on dry ground. 
\p
\v 9 When they came to the other side, Elijah said to Elisha, “What do you want me to do for you before ◄I am taken away/Yahweh
takes me away►?” 
\p Elisha replied, “I want to receive twice as much of your power
\add as the other prophets have, in order that they may know that I am succeeding you to be their
leader\add*.” 
\p
\v 10 Elijah replied, “You have asked for something which is difficult
\add for me to cause to happen\add*. But, if you see me when ◄I am taken from you/Yahweh takes me from you►, you will get what
you are requesting. But if you do not see me, then you will not get it.”
\p
\v 11 As they were walking and talking, suddenly a chariot that had fire
\add surrounding it\add*, pulled by horses which also had fire \add surrounding
them\add*, appeared. \add The chariot driver\add* drove the chariot between Elijah and Elisha and separated them. Then Elijah
was taken up to heaven in a ◄whirlwind/twisting wind►. 
\v 12 Elisha saw it. He cried out, “My father/master! My father/master! The chariots of us Israeli people and their drivers
\add have taken my master away\add*!” \add They disappeared into the
sky\add*, and Elisha never saw Elijah again. Then Elisha tore his own robe into two pieces
\add to show that he was sad\add*. 
\v 13 Elijah's cloak \add had fallen off when he was taken away,
so\add* Elisha picked it up and returned to the bank of the Jordan
\add River\add*. 
\v 14 He \add rolled up the cloak and\add* struck the water with it, and cried out, “Will Yahweh, the God who
\add enabled\add* Elijah \add to perform miracles, enable me to do similar
things\add*?” Then the water separated, and a path opened up for him, and Elisha went across.
\p
\v 15 When the group of prophets from Jericho saw what happened, they exclaimed, “Elisha now has the power that Elijah had!”
\f + \fk metonymy \f* They walked over to him and bowed down in front of him. 
\v 16  \add One of\add* them said, “Sir, if you permit us, fifty of our strongest men will go and search for your master
\add on the other side of the river\add*. Perhaps the Spirit of Yahweh has left him on some mountain or in some valley.”
\p Elisha replied, “No, do not send them.” 
\p
\v 17 But they continued to urge him. Finally he was tired of saying “No,” and he said, “Okay, send them.” So fifty men
searched for three days, but they did not find Elijah. 
\v 18 They returned to Jericho, and Elisha was still there. He said to them, “I told you that you should not go,
\add because you would not find him\add*!” \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* 
\s Elisha made the water pure 
\p
\v 19 Then the leaders of Jericho city came to talk with Elisha. One of them said, “Our master, we have a problem. You can see
that this is a very nice place \add to live in\add*. But the water is bad, and as a result, crops will not grow on the land.”
\p
\v 20 Elisha said to them, “Put some salt in a new bowl and bring the bowl to me.” So they brought it to him.
\p
\v 21 Then he went out to the spring \add from which the people in the town got
water\add*. He threw the salt into the spring. Then he said, “This is what Yahweh says: ‘I have made this water good/pure. No
longer will anyone who drinks it die, and now crops will be able to grow.’ ” \f + \fk litotes \f*
\v 22 And the water became pure, just as Elisha said it would be. Since that time it has always remained pure.
\s Elisha cursed boys who made fun of him 
\p
\v 23 Elisha left Jericho and went up to Bethel. As he was walking along the road, a group of young boys from Bethel
\add saw him and\add* started to make fun of him. They continued shouting, “Go away, you bald-headed man!”
\v 24 Elisha turned around and looked/glared at them. He asked Yahweh to ◄curse them/do something bad to them►. Immediately two
bears came out of the woods and mauled forty-two of them. 
\v 25 Elisha left Bethel and went to Carmel Hill, and after that he returned to Samaria
\add city\add*.
