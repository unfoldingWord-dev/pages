\c 13  
\s King Jehoahaz of Israel 
\p
\v 1 After Joash had been ruling Judah for almost twenty-three years, Jehu's son Jehoahaz became the king of Israel. He ruled
in Samaria \add city\add* for seventeen years. 
\v 2 He did many things that Yahweh said were evil and committed the same kind of sins that Jeroboam had committed, sins which
induced the people of Israel to sin. He did not stop committing those sins.
\v 3 So Yahweh became very angry with the Israeli people, and he allowed the army of King Hazael of Syria and his son Ben-Hadad
to defeat the Israelis many times. 
\p
\v 4 Then Jehoahaz prayed to Yahweh \add for help\add*, and Yahweh heeded him, because he saw that the army of the king of
Syria was oppressing the Israelis. 
\v 5 Yahweh sent a leader to Israel, who enabled them to be freed from being controlled by Syria. After that, the Israeli
people lived peacefully as they had done previously. 
\v 6 But they still continued to commit the same kind of sins that Jeroboam and his family had committed and which led the
Israelis to also sin. And the statue of the goddess Asherah remained in Samaria
\p
\v 7 Jehoahaz had only fifty men who rode on horses and ten chariots and 10,000 other soldiers, because the army of Syria had
killed all the rest, walking over them like people walk on dirt.
\p
\v 8  \add If you want to read about\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* everything else that Jehoahaz did, you can read about it in the book called
'The History of the Kings of Israel.' 
\v 9 Jehoahaz died \f + \ft euphemism \f* and was buried in Samaria. Then his son Jehoash became the king.
\s King Jehoash ruled Israel 
\p
\v 10 Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz, started to rule in Israel after King Joash had been ruling in Judah for 23 years. Jehoash
ruled in Samaria for 17 years. 
\v 11 He did many things that Yahweh said were evil. He refused to turn away from worshiping idols, which was the sin that
\add many years earlier King\add* Jeroboam had told the Israeli people to commit.
\p
\v 12 The other things that happened while Jehoash was king and all the things that he did are written in the book called 'The
account of What the Kings of Israel Did.' In that account they wrote about Jehoash's
\add army's\add* victories, and their war with \add the army of\add* King Amaziah of Judah.
\v 13 When Jehoash died, he was buried in Samaria where the \add other\add* kings of Israel were buried. Then his son Jeroboam
became king. 
\s Elisha died 
\p
\v 14 Elisha became very ill. Just before he died, King Jehoash went to Elisha and cried in front of him.
\add Saying the same words that Elisha had said when Elijah was taken to
heaven\add*, he said, "My father\f + \ft Or: master \f*! My father\f + \ft Or: master \f*! The chariots of us Israeli people and their drivers
\add are taking my master away\add*!" 
\p
\v 15 Elisha said to him, "Bring to me a bow and some arrows!" So the king did that.
\v 16 Then Elisha told the king to put his hands on the bow \add and prepare to shoot some
arrows\add*. And then Elisha put his own hands on the king's hands.
\p
\v 17 Then Elisha told him, "\add Have someone\add* open that window toward the east." So they opened it. Then Elisha said,
"Shoot!" So the king did. Then Elisha said, "That is the arrow that
\add indicates that your army\add* will defeat the Syrian army. Your army will completely defeat their
\add army\add* at Aphek \add town\add*." 
\p
\v 18 Then Elisha said, "Pick up the other arrows and strike the ground with them!" So the king picked up the arrows and struck
the ground three times. 
\v 19 But Elisha was angry with him. He exclaimed, "You should have struck the ground five or six times! If you had done that,
your army would have defeated the Syrian \add army\add* until they were completely wiped out! But now,
\add because you struck the ground only three times\add*, your army will defeat them only three times!"
\p
\v 20 Then Elisha died and was buried. 
\p Groups of raiders from Moab came to Israel each year during spring\f + \ft Or: the time when the cold season was ending \f*.
\v 21 One year, when some Israeli people were burying a man's body, they saw a group of those raiders.
\add They were afraid\add*; so quickly they threw that man's body into the tomb where Elisha
\add had been buried, and they ran away\add*. 
\p But as soon as the man's body touched Elisha's bones, the dead man became alive again and jumped up!
\s War between Israel and Syria 
\p
\v 22 King Hazael of Syria \add sent soldiers to\add* oppress the Israeli people all during the years that Jehoahaz
\add ruled Judah\add*. 
\v 23 But Yahweh was very kind \f + \ft doublet \f* to the Israeli people. He helped them because of the agreement that he had made with
\add their ancestors\add* Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. He would not get rid of the Israelis, and he still has not rejected them.
\p
\v 24 When Hazael the king of Syria died, his son Ben-Hadad became the king.
\v 25  \add The army of\add* King Jehoash of Israel defeated \add the army
of\add* King Ben-Hadad three times, and recaptured the cities that Ben-Hadad's army had captured during the time that Jehoash's
father Jehoahaz was ruling Israel.
