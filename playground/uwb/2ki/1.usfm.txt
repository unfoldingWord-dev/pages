\s Elijah condemned King Ahaziah 
\p
\v 1 After King Ahab died, \add the country of\add* Moab rebelled against Israel.
\v 2 One day, Ahaziah, \add the new king of Israel\add*, fell through the wooden slats\f + \ft Or: boards \f* around the edge of the flat roof
\add of his palace\add* in Samaria. He was badly injured, so he summoned some messengers and told them, "Go to Ekron
\add city in Philistia\add*, and ask their god Baalzebub whether I will recover\f + \ft Or: become well \f*."
\p
\v 3 But an angel from Yahweh said to Elijah, the prophet from Tishbe
\add town\add*, "The king of Samaria \add is sending\add* some messengers
\add to Ekron\add*. Go and meet them and say to them, 'Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are going to Ekron to
ask Baalzebub, the god of those people, \add whether you will recover\add*?
\v 4 Yahweh says \add that you should tell King Ahaziah\add* that he will not recover from his being injured; he will surely
die.' " 
\p
\v 5  \add So Elijah went to meet the messengers and told that to them,
and\add* they returned to the king \add instead of going to Ekron\add*. The king asked them, "Why did you return
\add very quickly\add*?" 
\p
\v 6 They replied, "A man came to meet us, and said to us, 'Return to the king who sent you and tell him that Yahweh says, "Is
it because there no God in Israel that you are sending \add messengers\add* to Ekron to consult Beelzebub, their god?\f + \ft Or: You seem
to think there is no God in Israel, with the result that you are sending
\add messengers\add* to Ekron to ask Beelzebub, their god, \add whether you will
recover\add*. \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* Go \add tell the king that\add* he will not recover from being injured; instead, he will surely die." ' "
\p
\v 7 The king said to them, "The man who came to meet you and told that to you, what was his appearance like?"
\p
\v 8 They replied, "He was wearing a cloak made from \add camel\add* hair \f + \ft Or: he was a man with a long beard \f* and had a
\add wide\add* leather belt around his waist." The king exclaimed, "That was Elijah!"
\p
\v 9 Then the king sent an officer with fifty soldiers to seize Elijah. They found Elijah sitting on the top of a hill. The
officer called out to him, "Prophet, the king commands that you come down here!"
\p
\v 10 But Elijah replied to the officer, "I am a prophet; so, I command that fire come down from the sky and burn up you and
your fifty soldiers!" Immediately, fire came down from the sky and completely burned up the officer and his fifty
\add soldiers\add*. 
\p
\v 11  \add When the king found out about that\add*, he sent another officer with fifty more soldiers. They went
\add to where Elijah was\add*, and the officer called out to him, "Prophet, the king commands that you come down immediately!"
\p
\v 12 But Elijah replied, "I am a prophet; \add to prove that\add*, I command that fire come down from the sky and kill you and
your soldiers!" Then a fire from God came down from the sky and killed the officer and his soldiers.
\p
\v 13  \add When the king heard about that\add*, he sent another officer with fifty more soldiers.
\add They went to where Elijah was\add*, and the officer prostrated himself in front of Elijah, and said to him, "Prophet, I
plead with you, be kind to me and my fifty soldiers, and do not kill us\f + \ft Or: allow us to remain alive \f*!
\v 14  \add We know that\add* two times fire came down from the sky and killed officers and the fifty soldiers who were with
them. So now, please be kind to me!" 
\p
\v 15 Then the angel from Yahweh said to Elijah, "Go down and \add go
with\add* him. Do not be afraid of him." So Elijah went with them to the king.
\p
\v 16 When Elijah \add arrived\add*, he said to the king, "This is what Yahweh says: 'You sent messengers to go to Ekron to ask
Beelzebub, their god, \add whether you would recover\add*. You acted as though \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* there is no God in Israel to consult. So
you will not recover from being injured; instead, you are going to die!' "
\v 17 So Ahaziah died, which is what Yahweh told Elijah would happen. Ahaziah's
\add younger\add* brother Joram became the new king, when Jehoram, the son of Jehoshaphat, had been ruling Judah for almost two
years. Ahaziah's brother became the king because Ahaziah had no son
\add to become the king\add*. 
\p
\v 18  \add If you want to know about\add* all the other things that Ahaziah did, they are \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* written in the book named 'The
Book of the History of the Kings of Israel.'
