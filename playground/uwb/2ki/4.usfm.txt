\s Elisha helped a poor widow 
\p
\v 1 One day the widow of one of \add Yahweh's\add* prophets came to Elisha and cried out to him, “My husband, who worked with
you, is dead. You know that he revered Yahweh \add very much\add*. But now a man to whom he owed a lot of money has come to me.
And \add because I cannot pay back the money, he is threatening\add* to take away my two sons to be his slaves
\add as payment for what I owe him\add*!” 
\p
\v 2 Elisha replied, “What can I do to help you? Tell me, what do you have in your house?”
\p She replied, “We have only a container of \add olive\add* oil; we have nothing else.”
\p
\v 3 Elisha said, “Go to your neighbors and borrow from them as many empty jars as you can.
\v 4 Then take the jars into your house with your sons. Shut the door. Then pour olive oil from your container into the other
jars. When each jar is full, set it aside \add and fill another jar. Keep doing that until all the jars are
full\add*.” 
\p
\v 5  \add So she did what Elisha told her to do\add*. Her sons kept bringing jars to her, and she kept filling them.
\v 6 Soon all the jars were full. So she said to one of her sons, “Bring me another jar!” But he replied, “There are no more
jars!” And then the olive oil stopped flowing. 
\p
\v 7 When she told Elijah \add what had happened\add*, he said to her, “Now sell the jars of oil. And
\add with the money you get\add*, pay what you owe, and there will be enough extra money to keep buying food for yourself and
your sons.” \add So she did that\add*. 
\s Elisha caused the son of the woman from Shunem to become alive again
\p
\v 8 One day Elisha went to Shunem \add town\add*. There was a wealthy woman who lived there
\add with her husband\add*. One day she invited Elisha to her house for a meal.
\add Elisha went there and\add* from then on, every time Elisha was in Shunem, he went to their house to eat a meal.
\v 9 One day the woman said to her husband, “I am sure that this man who often comes here is a prophet
\add who brings messages from\add* God. 
\v 10 I think we should make a small room for him on our \add flat\add* roof, and put a bed, a table, a chair, and a lamp in
it. If we do that, whenever he comes here, he will have a place to stay.”
\add So they did that\add*. 
\p
\v 11 One day Elisha returned to Shunem, and he went up to that room to rest.
\v 12 He said to his servant Gehazi, “Tell the woman that I want to speak to her.”
\add So the servant went and told her\add*. When she came to \add the doorway of Elisha's
room\add*, 
\v 13 Elisha said to Gehazi, “Tell her that we both appreciate all the kind things that she has done for us. Then ask her what
we can do for her. Ask, ‘Do you want \add me to go to\add* the king or the army commander, to request something for you?’ ”
\p \add Gehazi told her\add*, and she replied, “No, \add he does not need to do that,
because\add* my family/relatives are able to give me what I need.”
\p
\v 14  \add Later\add*, Elisha asked Gehazi, “What do you think that we can do for that woman?”
\p He replied, “She does not have a son, and her husband is an old man.
\add So maybe we should ask Yahweh to enable her to have a son\add*.”
\p
\v 15 Elisha told Gehazi, “Call her back again.” \add So Gehazi went and called
her\add*. And when the woman returned, as she stood in the doorway,
\v 16 Elisha said to her, “About this time next year you will be holding your
\add infant\add* son in your arms.” But she protested, “O, Sir, you are a prophet
\add who brings messages from\add* God, so please do not deceive/lie to me by saying things like that!”
\p
\v 17 But a few months later, the woman became pregnant, and she gave birth to a son at that time the following year, just like
Elisha had predicted. 
\p
\v 18 When the child was growing up, one day he went out to the fields to see his father, who was
\add working\add* with the men who were harvesting \add grain\add*.
\v 19  \add Suddenly\add* the boy exclaimed, “My head \add hurts\add*! My head
\add hurts very bad\add*!” 
\p His father said to one of the servants, “Carry him home to his mother!”
\v 20 So the servant carried him home, and his mother held him on her lap. But at noontime the boy died.
\v 21 She carried him up \add the steps\add* to the prophet's room and laid him on the bed. She left him there and went out and
shut the door. 
\p
\v 22 She then called out to her husband, saying, “Send to me one of the servants and a donkey, so that I can
\add ride on it\add* quickly to the prophet, and then come back!”
\add But she did not tell her husband that their son had died\add*.
\p
\v 23 Her husband \add called out to her\add* and said, “Why \add do you want to
go\add* today? This is not the day when we celebrate the festival of the new moon, and it is not a Sabbath day!”
\p But she only replied, “\add Just do what I requested and\add* everything will be all right.”
\p
\v 24 So she \add told the servant\add* to put saddles on \add two\add* donkeys, and as they left, she said, “Hurry! Do not
slow down if I do not tell you to do that!” 
\v 25 As they approached Carmel Hill, where Elisha was, Elisha saw her in the distance. He said to Gehazi, “Look, the woman
from Shunem is coming! 
\v 26 Run to her, and ask her if everything is all right with her and her husband and with her child!”
\p \add So Gehazi ran to her and asked her, but she did not tell Gehazi
anything\add*. She only said, “Yes, everything is fine.” 
\p
\v 27 But when she came to where Elisha was, she \add prostrated herself on the ground in front of Elisha
and\add* took hold of his feet. Gehazi started to push her away, but Elisha said, “◄Do not push her away/Leave her alone►!
Something is troubling her very much, but Yahweh has not told me what it is.”
\p
\v 28 Then she said to Elisha, “O sir, I did not request you to enable me to give birth to a son [RHQ]. And I told you not to
lie to me about that!” [RHQ] 
\p
\v 29 Then Elisha \add realized that something must have happened to her son.
So\add* he said to Gehazi, “Get ready \add to leave immediately\add*. Take my staff/walking stick and go
\add to her home\add*. Do not \add stop to\add* talk to anyone on the way. Go quickly
\add to where her son is\add* and lay the staff on the child's face.
\add If you do that, perhaps Yahweh will enable him to be well\add*.”
\p
\v 30 But the boy's mother said, “Just \add as certain\add* as Yahweh lives and you live, I will not go home if you do not go
with me.” So Elisha returned with her \add to her home\add*. 
\p
\v 31 Gehazi hurried quickly, and \add when he got to the woman's
home\add*, he laid the staff/walking stick on the child's face, but the child did not move or say anything.
\p So Gehazi returned to meet Elisha \add along the road\add*, and told him, “The child is still dead.”
\v 32 When Elisha reached the house, he saw that the boy was lying dead on his bed.
\v 33 Elisha went into the room by himself and shut the door and prayed to Yahweh.
\v 34 Then he lay down on the boy's body, and put his mouth on the boy's mouth, and put his eyes on the boy's eyes, and put his
hands on the boy's hands. Then the boy's body started to become warm!
\v 35 Elisha got up and walked back and forth in the room \add several
times\add*. Then he stretched his body on the boy's body again. The boy sneezed seven times and opened his eyes!
\p
\v 36 Then Elisha summoned Gehazi. He said, “Call the boy's mother!”
\add So Gehazi went and called her\add*, and when she came in, Elisha said, “Here, take your son!”
\v 37 She \add gratefully\add* prostrated herself at Elisha's feet. Then she picked up her son and carried him downstairs.
\s Elisha made some stew edible 
\p
\v 38 Then Elisha returned to Gilgal. But at that time there was ◄a famine/very little food► in that area. One day as the group
of prophets were sitting in front of Elisha \add listening to what he was
teaching\add*, he said to his servant, “Put a large pot on \add the
stove\add* and make some stew for these men.” 
\p
\v 39 One of the prophets went out to the fields to gather some vegetables. But he gathered only some wild gourds and put them
in his cloak and brought them back. He shredded them and put them in the pot, but he did not know that the gourds were
poisonous. 
\v 40 He served the stew to the prophets, but after the men had eaten only a couple bites, they cried out, “Elisha, there is
something in the pot that will kill us!” 
\p So they would not eat it. 
\v 41 Elisha said, “Bring me some flour.” \add They brought him some,
and\add* he threw it in the pot and he said, “It is all right now. You can eat it.” And they ate it, and it did not harm them.
\s Elisha multiplied food for the prophets 
\p
\v 42 One day a man from Baal-Shalishah \add town\add* brought to Elisha a sack of freshly cut grain and twenty loaves of
barley bread, made from the first grain that they harvested \add that
year\add*. 
\p Elisha said \add to his servant\add*, “Give it to the group of prophets, so that they can eat it.”
\v 43 But his servant exclaimed, “Do you think that we can feed a hundred of us prophets with only that much?” [RHQ]
\p But Elisha replied, “Give it to the prophets so that they can eat it, because Yahweh says that there will be plenty for all
of them, and there will be some left over!” 
\v 44 After his servant gave it to the prophets, they ate \add all that they
wanted\add*, and there was food left over, just as Yahweh had promised.
