\v 1 After Zedekiah had been ruling for nine years, on January 15 of that year, King Nebuchadnezzar arrived with his whole
army, and they surrounded Jerusalem. \add Against the walls of the
city\add*, they built ramps \add made of dirt, so that they could climb up the ramps and attack the
city\add*. 
\v 2 They did that for two years. 
\v 3 After Zedekiah had been ruling for eleven years, on July 18 of that year, the famine\f + \ft Or: shortage of food \f* had become very
bad. All their food was gone. 
\v 4 Then the Babylonian soldiers broke through part of the city wall,
\add and that enabled them to enter the city\add*. All the soldiers of Judah
\add wanted to escape\add*. But the Babylonian soldiers surrounded the city, so the
\add king and\add* the soldiers of Judah waited until it was nighttime. Then they fled through the gate that was between the
two walls near the king's park. They ran across the fields and started to go down to the Jordan River Valley.
\v 5 But the Babylonian soldiers chased\f + \ft Or: ran \f* after them. They caught the king when he was by himself in the valley near the
Jordan River. He was by himself because all his soldiers had abandoned him.
\v 6 The Babylonian soldiers took King Zedekiah to Riblah \add city\add* in Babylon. There the king of Babylon decided what
they would do to punish him. 
\v 7 The king of Babylon forced Zedekiah to watch as the Babylonian soldiers killed all of Zedekiah's sons. Then they gouged
out Zedekiah's eyes. They put bronze chains on \add his hands and
feet\add* and took him to Babylon \add city\add*. 
\p
\v 8 On August 14 of that year, after Nebuchadnezzar had been ruling for nineteen years, Nebuzaradan arrived in Jerusalem. He
was one of king Nebuchadnezzar's officials and captain of the men that guarded the king.
\v 9 He \add commanded his soldiers to\add* burn down the temple of Yahweh, the king's palace, and all the houses in Jerusalem.
So they burned down all the important buildings in the city. 
\v 10 Then Nebuzaradan supervised all the soldiers of the Babylonian army as they tore down the walls of Jerusalem.
\v 11 Then he and his soldiers took to Babylon the people who were still living in the city, the other people
\add who lived in that area\add*, and the soldiers who had previously surrendered to the Babylonian army.
\v 12 But Nebuzaradan allowed some of the very poor people to stay in Judah to take care of the vineyards and to
\add plant crops in\add* the fields. 
\p
\v 13 The Babylonian soldiers broke into pieces the bronze pillars, the bronze carts with wheels, and the huge bronze basin,
all of which were in the temple courtyard, and they took all the bronze to Babylon.
\v 14 They also took the pots, the shovels, the instruments for snuffing out\f + \ft Or: extinguishing \f* the lamps, the dishes, and all the
other bronze items that the Israeli priests had used for offering sacrifices at the temple.
\v 15 The soldiers also took away the firepans\f + \ft Or: trays for carrying burning coals \f*, the basins, and
\add all the other\add* items made of pure gold or pure silver. 
\p
\v 16 The bronze from the two pillars, the carts with wheels, and the huge basin were very heavy; they could not be weighed.
These things had been made\f + \ft Or: A man named Hiram had made these things \f* for the temple when Solomon
\add was the king of Israel\add*. 
\v 17 Each of the pillars was 27 ft.\f + \ft Or: 8 meters► tall. The bronze capital\f + \ft Or: top \f* of each pillar was ◄7-1\f + \ft Or: 2 \f* ft., Or: 2.3 meters \f* high.
They were each decorated all around with something that looked like a net made of bronze chains connecting bronze pomegranates.
\p
\v 18 Nebuzaradan took with him to Babylon Seraiah the supreme priest, Zephaniah his assistant, and the three men who guarded
the entrance \add to the temple\add*. 
\v 19 And from the people who were still hiding in Jerusalem, he took one officer from the Judean army, five of the king's
advisors, the chief secretary of the army commander who was in charge of recruiting men to join the army, and sixty other
important Judean men. 
\v 20 Nebuzaradan took them all to the king of Babylon at Riblah
\add city\add*. 
\v 21 There at Riblah, in Hamath province, the king of Babylon commanded that they all be executed.
\p That is what happened when the people of Judah were taken forcefully\f + \ft Or: exiled \f* from their land
\add to Babylon\add*. 
\s Gedaliah was appointed governor in Judah 
\p
\v 22 Then King Nebuchadnezzar appointed Gedaliah, who was the son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan, to be the governor of the
people who were still living in Judah. 
\v 23 When all the army captains of Judah and their soldiers found out that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah to be
the governor, they met with him at Mizpah \add town\add*. These army captains were Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, Johanan the
son of Kareah, Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth from Netophah \add town\add*, and Jaazaniah from the Maacah region.
\p
\v 24 Gedaliah solemnly promised them that the officials from Babylon
\add were not planning to harm them\add*. He said, “You may live in this land
\add without being afraid\add* and serve the king of Babylon, and
\add if you do\add*, everything will go well for you.” 
\p
\v 25 But in October of that year, Ishmael, whose grandfather Elishama was one of the relatives of the descendants of King
David, went to Mizpah along with ten other men and assassinated\f + \ft Or: killed \f* Gedaliah and all the men who were with him. There were
also men from Judah and men from Babylon whom they assassinated.
\v 26 Then many \f + \ft hyperbole \f* of the people from Judah, important people and unimportant ones, and the army captains, were very afraid
of what the Babylonians \add would do to them\add*, so they fled to Egypt.
\s Jehoiachin was released 
\p
\v 27 Thirty-seven years after King Jehoiachin of Judah was taken to Babylon,
\add Nebuchadnezzar's son\add* Evil-Merodach became the king of Babylon. He was kind to Jehoiachin, and on April 2 of that
year, he released\f + \ft Or: freed \f* Jehoiachin from prison. 
\v 28 He always spoke kindly to Jehoiachin and honored him more than the other kings who had been taken\f + \ft Or: exiled \f* to Babylon.
\v 29 He gave Jehoiachin new clothes to replace the clothes that he had been wearing in prison, and he allowed Jehoiachin to
eat at the king's table every day for the rest of his life. 
\v 30 The king of Babylon also gave him money every day, so that he could buy the things that he needed. The king continued to
do that until Jehoiachin died.
