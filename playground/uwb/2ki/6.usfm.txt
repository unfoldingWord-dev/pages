\c 6  
\s The axe head floated 
\p
\v 1 One day a group of prophets said to Elisha, “Look, this place where we meet together with you is very small.
\v 2 Allow us to go to the Jordan \add River and cut down some trees to
make\add* logs to build a new meeting place.” So Elisha said, “Okay, go.”
\p
\v 3 One of them said to Elisha, “Please come with us.” So Elisha replied, “Okay, I will go with you.”
\p
\v 4 So they went together. When they reached the Jordan \add River\add*, they cut down some trees.
\p
\v 5 But while one of them was cutting down a tree, suddenly the axe head
\add separated from the handle and\add* fell into the water. He cried out to Elisha, “O, Master, what shall I do?
\add The axe is not mine\add*; I borrowed it!” 
\p
\v 6 Elisha replied, “Where did it fall into the water?” After the man showed him the place, Elisha cut off a stick, and threw
it into the water, and caused the iron axe head to float \add on top of the
water\add*. 
\v 7 Elisha said, “Take it out of the water.” So the man reached his hand down and picked up the axe head.
\s Elisha tricked the army of Syria 
\p
\v 8 Whenever the king of Syria \add prepared to send his army to\add* fight against Israel, he first consulted his officers,
and then told them where they should set up their tents. 
\p
\v 9 But each time, Elisha would send a message to warn the king of Israel,
\add telling him where the army of Syria was planning to attack them\add*, saying, “Be sure that your army does not go near
that place, because the army of Syria has set up their tents there.”
\v 10 So the king of Israel would send \add messengers to\add* warn
\add the people who lived in\add* that place, and the people would remain on guard. That happened several times.
\p
\v 11 The king of Syria was very upset/disturbed/angry about that. So he summoned his army officers and said to them,
“\add Obviously\add* one of you is ◄betraying us/revealing our plans► to the king of Israel. Which one of you is doing it?”
\p
\v 12 One of his officers answered, “Your Majesty, it is not one of us. Elisha the prophet
\add knows what we plan to do\add*, and he tells the king of Israel everything. He even knows what you say in your own
bedroom!” 
\p
\v 13 The king of Syria replied, “Go and find out where he is, and I will send
\add some men there\add* to capture him.” Someone told him, “People say that he is in Dothan
\add town north of Samaria\add*.” 
\v 14 So the king sent a large group of soldiers \add to Dothan\add* with horses and chariots. They arrived at night and
surrounded the town. 
\p
\v 15 Early the next morning, Elisha's servant got up and went outside the house. He saw the soldiers of Syria with their
horses and chariots surrounding the town. So he went inside \add the house and reported it to Elisha
and\add* exclaimed, “O, sir! What are we going to do?” 
\p
\v 16 Elisha replied, “Do not be afraid! Those who will be helping us will be more than those who will be helping them!”
\p
\v 17 Then he prayed, “Yahweh, I request that you open my servant's eyes in order that he can see
\add what is out there\add*!” So Yahweh enabled the servant to look out and see that surrounding the hill on which the town
\add was built\add* was a huge number of horses and chariots made of fire!
\p
\v 18 When the army of Syria prepared to attack Elisha, he prayed again, saying, “Yahweh, cause all these soldiers to become
blind!” Yahweh answered his prayer and caused them to be unable to see clearly.
\p
\v 19 Then Elisha went to them and said, “You are not on the right road; this is not the city that you are searching for. I
will take you to the man whom you are searching for.” But he led them to Samaria,
\add the capital of Israel\add*! 
\p
\v 20 As soon as they entered Samaria, Elisha prayed again, saying, “Yahweh, now enable these soldiers to see correctly again!”
So Yahweh enabled them to see correctly, and they were surprised to see that they were inside Samaria
\add city\add*! 
\p
\v 21 When the king of Israel saw them, he said to Elisha, “Sir, shall I
\add tell my soldiers to\add* kill them? Shall we kill all of them?”
\p
\v 22 Elisha replied, “No, you must not kill them. If your army captured many of your enemies in a battle, you would certainly
not \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* kill them. Give these men something to eat and drink, and then allow them to return to their king.”
\v 23 So the king of Israel did that. He told his servants to provide a big feast for them. And when they had eaten and drunk
plenty, he sent them away. They returned to the king of Syria \add and told him what had
happened\add*. So for a while after that, soldiers from Syria stopped raiding/attacking towns in Israel.
\s The army of Syria surrounded Samaria 
\p
\v 24 But some time later, Ben-Hadad, the king of Syria, assembled his entire army, and they went to Samaria and surrounded the
city \add for a long time\add*. 
\v 25 Because of that, after a while there was hardly any food left inside the city, with the result that eventually a donkey's
head, \add which was usually worthless\add*, cost eighty pieces of silver, and ◄a cup/0.3 liter► of dove's dung cost five
pieces of silver. 
\p
\v 26 One day when the king of Israel was walking on top of the city wall, a woman cried out to him, “Your Majesty, help me!”
\p
\v 27 He replied, “If Yahweh will not help you, I certainly cannot \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* help you. I certainly \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* do not have any wheat or
wine! 
\v 28 What is your problem?” She replied, “Several days ago, that women
\add over there\add* said to me, ‘\add Because we have nothing left to
eat\add*, let's kill your son today, in order that we can eat his flesh. Then tomorrow we can
\add kill my son and\add* eat his flesh.’ 
\p
\v 29 So we \add killed my son and cut his body up and\add* boiled his flesh and ate it. The next day, I said to her, ‘Now give
your son to me, in order that we can \add kill him and cook his flesh
and\add* eat it.’ But she has hidden her son!” 
\p
\v 30 When the king heard what the woman said, he tore his robe \add to show that he was very
distressed\add*. The people who were standing close to the wall were able to see that the king was wearing rough cloth
underneath his robe \add because he was very distressed\add*. 
\v 31 The king exclaimed, “I wish/hope that God will strike me dead if I do not cut off the head of Elisha today,
\add because he is the one who has caused these terrible things to happen to
us\add*!” 
\p
\v 32 So the king sent an officer to get Elisha. 
\p Before the officer arrived, Elisha was sitting in his house with some Israeli elders who were talking with him. Elisha said
to them, “That murderer, \add the king of Israel\add*, is sending someone here to kill me. Listen: when he arrives, shut the
door and do not allow him to come in. And the king will be coming right behind that officer!”
\v 33 And while he was still speaking, the king and the officer arrived. The king said, “It is Yahweh who has caused us to have
all this trouble/suffering. ◄Why should I wait any longer \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* for him to do something
\add to help us\add*?/It is useless for me to wait any longer for him to help us!►”
