\c 8  
\s The widow from Shunem recovered her land 
\p
\v 1 After Elisha had caused the son of the woman from Shunem \add town\add* to become alive again, he had told her that she
should leave with her family and live somewhere else for a while, because Yahweh was going to ◄send a famine/cause food to
become very scarce► in the land. He said that the famine would last for seven years.
\v 2 So the woman had done what Elisha told her to do. She and her family had gone to live in the Philistia
\add region\add* for seven years. 
\p
\v 3 After the seven years were ended, they returned to their home. The woman went to the king to request that her house and
her land be given back to her. 
\v 4 When she arrived, the king was talking with Gehazi, Elisha's servant. The king was saying to him, “Tell me all the great
things that Elisha has done.” 
\v 5 While Gehazi was telling the king that Elisha had caused the son of a woman
\add from Shunem\add* to become alive again, that woman came in and requested the king to enable her to get her house and land
back again. Gehazi exclaimed, “Your Majesty, this is the woman whose son Elisha caused to become alive again!”
\p
\v 6 When the king asked her about it, she told him \add that what Gehazi had said was
true\add*. The king summoned one of his officials and said to him,
“\add I want\add* everything that this woman possessed previously, including the value of all the crops that have been
harvested during these last seven years while she was away from her land, to be given back to her.”
\add So the official did that\add*. 
\s Elisha predicted the death of the king of Syria 
\p
\v 7 Elisha went to Damascus, \add the capital of Syria\add*, at the time when Ben-Hadad, the king of Syria, was
\add very\add* sick. When someone told the king that Elisha was in Damascus,
\v 8 the king told \add one of his officials named\add* Hazael, “Go and talk to that prophet and take a present/gift with you
to give to him. Request him to ask Yahweh if I will recover from my illness.”
\p
\v 9 So Hazael went to talk with Elisha. He took with him forty camels that were carrying many kinds of goods that were
produced in Damascus. When Hazael met him, he said to him, “Your friend Ben-Hadad, the king of Syria, sent me to ask you
whether \add you think\add* he will recover from his illness.” 
\p
\v 10 Elisha said to Hazael, “Go and say to him, ‘Yes, you will certainly not die from this illness,’ but Yahweh has shown me
that he will certainly die \add before he recovers\add*.” 
\v 11 Then Elisha stared at him and had a terrified look on his face. That caused Hazael to feel uneasy/embarrassed. Then
\add suddenly\add* Elisha started to cry. 
\p
\v 12 Hazael said, “Sir, why are you crying?” 
\p Elisha replied, “Because \add Yahweh has enabled\add* me to know the terrible things that you will do to the people of
Israel: you will burn their cities with walls around them, you will kill their fine young men that with a sword, you will bash
the heads of their children, and you will rip open the bellies of their pregnant women
\add with a sword\add*.” 
\p
\v 13 Hazael replied, “I am \add as insignificant as\add* [MET] a dog; ◄how could I do such things?/I would never do such
terrible things!►” [RHQ] 
\p Elisha replied, “Yahweh has also revealed to me that you will become the king of Syria.”
\p
\v 14 Then Hazael left and returned to his master/boss \add the king\add*, who asked him, “What did Elisha say?”
\p He replied, “He told me that you would certainly recover.” 
\v 15 But the next day, \add while the king was sleeping\add*, Hazael took a blanket and soaked it in water. Then he spread it
on the king's face \add in order that he could not breathe\add*, and he died. Then Hazael became the king of Syria instead of
Ben-Hadad. 
\s King Jehoram of Judah 
\p
\v 16 After King Joram, the son of Ahab, had been ruling in Israel for almost five years, Jehoshaphat's son Jehoram became the
king of Judah. 
\v 17 He was thirty-two years old when he became the king, and he ruled in Jerusalem for eight years.
\v 18 His wife was the daughter of King Ahab. And like everyone in Ahab's family, he continually did the evil things that the
previous kings of Israel had done. He did things that Yahweh said are wrong.
\v 19 But Yahweh did not want to get rid of the people of Judah, because of what he had promised David, who served him
\add very well\add*. He had promised David that his descendants [MET] would always rule Judah.
\p
\v 20 During the time that Jehoram ruled, \add the king of\add* Edom rebelled against Judah, and they appointed their own king.
\v 21 So Jehoram went with his army and all their chariots to Zair
\add city near the border of Edom\add*. There the army of Edom surrounded them. But during the night, Jehoram and the
commanders in their chariots were able to get through the enemy lines and escaped. And all his soldiers also fled to their
homes. 
\v 22 So after that, Edom was no longer controlled by Judah, and it is still like that. During that same time, the people of
Libnah \add city\add* also freed themselves from being controlled by Judah.
\p
\v 23  \add If you want to read about\add* the other things that Jehoram did, they are written in the book named 'The History
of the Kings of Judah.' 
\v 24 Jehoram died [EUP] and was buried where the other kings of Judah had been buried in
\add the part of Jerusalem called\add* 'the City of David.' Then Jehoram's son Ahaziah became the king.
\s King Ahaziah of Judah 
\p
\v 25 After Ahab's son Joram has been ruling in Israel for almost twelve years, Jehoram's son Ahaziah became the king of Judah.
\v 26 Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he started to rule. He ruled in Jerusalem for
\add only\add* one year. His mother's name was Athaliah, \add the daughter of King Ahab
and\add* the granddaughter of King Omri of Israel. 
\v 27 King Ahab conducted his life just like the members of Ahab's family had done. He did things that Yahweh said are very
evil. 
\p
\v 28 Ahaziah's army joined the army of King Joram of Israel to fight against the army of King Hazael of Syria. Their armies
started fighting at Ramoth \add city\add* in the Gilead \add region\add*, and the soldiers of Syria wounded Joram.
\v 29 King Joram returned to Jezreel \add city\add* to recover from his wounds. King Ahaziah went to visit him there.
