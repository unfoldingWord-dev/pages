\c 2  
\s The Israelis sinned in spite of God's care for them 
\p
\v 1 Yahweh gave me another message 
\q
\v 2  \add to proclaim to everyone in Jerusalem. He said that I should tell them
this:\add* \f + \fk metaphor \f* 
\q “I, Yahweh, remember that you very much wanted to please me \add long
ago\add*. 
\q2 \add You tried to please me like\add* a bride \add tries to please her
husband\add*; 
\q You loved me, 
\q2 and you followed me through the desert \f + \fk doublet \f*. 
\q
\v 3 At that time you Israelis ◄were set apart/belonged only► to me;
\q2 \add you belonged to me like\add* the first part of the harvests belong to me \f + \fk metaphor \f*.
\q I promised to punish all those who harmed you, my people, 
\q2 and truly I did send disasters on them. 
\q2 \add That happened because\add* I, Yahweh, said \add that it would
happen\add*.” 
\b
\q
\v 4 So, you \add descendants of\add* \f + \fk metonymy \f* Jacob, all you people of \f + \fk metonymy \f* Israel,
\p
\v 5 listen to what Yahweh says: 
\q2 “◄What sin did I commit \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* that caused your ancestors to turn far away from me?/Though your ancestors found no fault in
me, they turned far away from me.► 
\q They worshiped worthless idols, 
\q2 and they themselves became worthless. 
\q
\v 6 They did not say, ‘Yahweh brought us \add safely\add* out of Egypt,
\q and he led us through a desert 
\q2 where there were a lot of pits; 
\q he led us where there was no water and where it was very dangerous,
\q2 through a land where no one lives, and no one even travels. 
\q ◄So where is Yahweh now?/So he should be helping us now!► \f + \fk rhetorical question \f*’
\q
\v 7 And when I brought you into a very fertile land, 
\q2 in order that you could enjoy all the fruit and \add other\add* good things that you would harvest,
\q you caused the land that I promised to give to you to be unfit for me
\q2 and to become disgusting/detestable to me. 
\q
\v 8 Your priests also did not say, 
\q2 ‘◄Where is Yahweh now?/Yahweh should be helping us now!►’ \f + \fk rhetorical question \f*
\q Those who teach/explain God's laws do not \add want to\add* know me,
\q2 and your leaders have rebelled against me. 
\q Your prophets gave you messages from \add their god\add* Baal,
\q2 and they worship worthless idols.” 
\s Yahweh accused the Israeli people 
\b
\q
\v 9 “So, I will accuse you in court. 
\q In future years, I will say what your children and your grandchildren have done that is wrong.
\q \add That will happen because\add* I, Yahweh, have said \add that it will
happen\add*. 
\b
\q
\v 10 If you go west to the island of Cyprus, 
\q2 or if you go east to Kedar land, 
\q and if you ask people in those places, 
\q2 they will tell you that no people \add from their countries\add* have ever done the wicked things that you people have
done! 
\q
\v 11 The people of no nation have ever \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* abandoned their gods that they thought were glorious
\q2 and started to worship gods that are not really gods, 
\q but you people have abandoned me, your glorious God, 
\q2 and are worshiping gods that are useless. 
\q
\v 12  \add It is as though everything in\add* the sky is surprised and dismayed/appalled
\add about what you have done\add*; 
\q2 \add it is as though\add* they tremble because they are very horrified.
\q
\v 13 You, my people, have done two evil things: 
\q you have rejected me, the one who is like \f + \fk metaphor \f* a fountain \add where you can
obtain\add* fresh water, 
\q2 and you \add are worshiping gods that are like\add* \f + \fk metaphor \f* pits in the ground
\q2 that are cracked and which are not able to hold any water. 
\b
\q
\v 14 You Israeli people, you were certainly not \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* slaves when you were born;
\q2 you were captured \add by your enemies\add*. 
\q
\v 15  \add Your enemies\add* \f + \fk metaphor \f* roared like lions, 
\q2 and they destroyed your land. 
\q Now your towns have been burned, 
\q2 and no one lives in them. 
\q
\v 16 Soldiers from Memphis and Tahpenes, \add cities in Egypt\add*, have
\add defeated you\add* 
\q2 and shaved your heads \add to show that you are their slaves\add*.
\q
\v 17 But it is \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* because you abandoned me, Yahweh, 
\q2 that these disasters have happened to you. 
\q
\v 18 So ◄why are you trying to make an alliance with \f + \fk metaphor \f* the rulers of Egypt?/it certainly will not help you to make an
alliance with the rulers of Egypt.► \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* 
\q2 Why are you trying to make an alliance with \f + \fk metaphor \f* the rulers of Assyria who live near the
\add Euphrates\add* River? 
\q
\v 19  \add It is because\add* you have been very wicked that I \f + \fk personification \f* will punish you.
\q2 It is because you have turned away from me that I \f + \fk personification \f* will condemn you.
\q \add When I do that\add*, you will realize that bitter and evil \f + \fk doublet \f* things will happen to you because you have forsaken
me, Yahweh, your God, 
\q2 and you no longer have an awesome respect for me. 
\q \add That will certainly happen because\add* I, Yahweh, the commander of the armies of angels in heaven, have said it.
\b
\q
\v 20 Long ago, you stopped obeying me \f + \fk metaphor \f*, and you would not allow me to lead you \f + \fk metaphor \f*;
\q2 you refused to worship me. 
\q Instead, you worship idols that are under trees on the top of every hill,
\q2 and your young women have sex with \f + \fk euphemism \f* \add men at those places\add*.
\q
\v 21  \add It is as though\add* \f + \fk metaphor \f* you were a grapevine that I planted
\q2 when it was a cutting from a very good vine. 
\q So now it is disgusting that \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* you have become like a rotten worthless vine.
\q
\v 22 Your guilt from your sins is like \f + \fk metaphor \f* very bad stains on a cloth,
\q2 and you cannot get rid of those stains even by using very strong soap.
\q \add This is true because\add* I, Yahweh, have said it. 
\q
\v 23 You say that you have not sinned. 
\q You say ‘We have not become unacceptable to God; 
\q2 we have not worshiped Baal.’ 
\q But think about \add the disgusting things that you do very eagerly\add* in
\add Hinnom\add* Valley \add outside Jerusalem\add*. 
\q2 You are like desperate female camels, running here and there
\add to find male camels to have sex with\add*. 
\q
\v 24 You are like wild female donkeys in the desert. 
\q2 They sniff the air to find where the male donkeys are, 
\q2 and no one can \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* restrain them. 
\q The male donkeys that want them do not become tired searching for them,
\q2 because at mating time they find them easily. 
\q
\v 25 You constantly run here and there \add to find idols to worship\add*, with the result that your sandals are worn out,
\q2 and your throats have become dry. 
\q \add I told you to stop doing that\add* 
\q2 but you said, ‘We cannot stop, because we love foreign gods,
\q2 and we must worship them.’ ” 
\b
\p
\v 26  \add Yahweh says this:\add* 
\q “A robber is disgraced when he is caught. 
\q2 And all of you, including your kings and priests and prophets, are similarly disgraced.
\q
\v 27 You say to \add a piece of\add* wood \add that is carved to become a sacred
idol\add*, ‘You are our father!’ 
\q2 And you say to a stone \add that you have set up\add*, ‘You are our mother!’
\q You have rejected [IDI] me, 
\q2 but when you experience troubles, 
\q you cry out to me to rescue you. 
\q
\v 28 Why do you not \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* cry out to the gods that you made? 
\q You have as many gods as you have cities and towns in Judah. 
\q2 So why do you not plead with them to rescue you 
\q2 when you experience disasters? 
\b
\q
\v 29 You complain that it was wrong for me \add not to have rescued
you\add*, 
\q2 but you have all rebelled against me. 
\q
\v 30 I punished some of you, 
\q2 but you did not learn anything from my doing that. 
\q You have killed many of the prophets that I \add sent to you\add*,
\q2 like \f + \fk simile \f* fierce lions kill other animals. 
\b
\p
\v 31 You people of Israel, pay attention to what I say. 
\q I have certainly \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* never \add abandoned you\add* in a desert;
\q2 I have never \add left you\add* in a very dark land. 
\q So, why do you, my people, say ‘We are free from God's control;
\q2 we will not return to \add worship\add* God anymore’? 
\q
\v 32 A young woman would certainly never \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* forget \add to wear\add* her jewelry,
\q2 and a bride would never \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* forget to wear her wedding dress,
\q but you my people have forgotten me for many years. 
\q
\v 33 You know how to easily find \add gods from other countries\add* whom you can love.
\q2 You can find them as easily as a prostitute \add can find men to sleep
with\add*. 
\q
\v 34 Although you have on your clothes the blood of poor people whom you have murdered,
\q2 people who ◄were innocent/had not done things that are wrong►,
\q
\v 35 you say ‘We have not done anything that is wrong; 
\q2 so surely \add Yahweh\add* is not angry with us.’ 
\q But I will punish \f + \fk metonymy \f* you \add severely\add* 
\q2 for saying ‘We have not sinned.’ 
\b
\q
\v 36 Previously you requested \add the army of\add* Assyria to help you,
\q2 but they were not able to help you. 
\q Now you have requested \add the army\add* Egypt to help you, 
\q2 but they will not be able to help you, either. 
\q
\v 37 They will capture you, and you will be \add their prisoners\add* \f + \fk metonymy \f*,
\q2 led to Egypt, \add very ashamed\add* with your hands on your heads.
\q That will happen because I, Yahweh, have rejected those nations that you are relying on,
\q2 and they will not be able to help you at all.”
