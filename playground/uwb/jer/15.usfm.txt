\c 15  
\s Yahweh said what would happen to the people of Judah 
\p
\v 1 Then Yahweh said this to me: “Even if Moses and Samuel could
\add come back from their graves and\add* and stand in front of me
\add and plead with me for these Israeli people\add*, I would not act mercifully [IDI] toward these people.
\add I would tell you to\add* send them away from me. Cause them to leave me!
\v 2 And if they ask you, ‘Where shall we go?’, tell them, ‘This is what Yahweh says:
\q The ones that I say must die, will die: 
\q The ones that I say must die in wars \f + \fr metonymy \f*, will die in wars.
\q The ones that I say must die from hunger, will die from hunger.
\q The ones that I say must be captured \add and taken to other countries\add*, will be captured and taken to other countries.
\p
\v 3 I will send four things that will get rid of them: I will send
\add enemy soldiers using\add* swords to kill them. I will send wild dogs to drag away
\add their corpses\add*. I will send vultures to eat \add their corpses\add*. And I will send other wild animals to eat what
remains \add of their corpses\add*. 
\v 4 Because of \add the wicked things that\add* King Manasseh did in Jerusalem, I will cause people in all the kingdoms of the
earth to be horrified concerning \add what will happen in Judah to\add* my people.
\q
\v 5 You people of Jerusalem, no one will \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* feel sorry for you.
\q2 No one will \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* weep/cry for you. 
\q2 No one will \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* ◄stop/go to your houses► and ask ◄how you are/if you are well►.
\q
\v 6 You people have abandoned me; 
\q2 you have continued to walk away from me \f + \fr doublet \f*. 
\q So, I will lift up my fist to smash you; 
\q2 I will not act mercifully toward you any longer. 
\q
\v 7 At the gates of your cities, I will \add scatter you like a farmer scatters the chaff from his grain
by\add* ◄winnowing it/throwing it up to allow the wind to blow it away► \f + \fr metaphor \f*.
\q2 You, my people, have refused to turn away from your evil behavior.
\q So, I will get rid of you, 
\q2 and I will even cause your children to be killed. 
\q
\v 8 I will cause there to be more widows \add in Judah\add* 
\q2 than there are grains of sand on the seashore \f + \fr hyperbole \f*. 
\q At noontime, \add when people will not be expecting it to happen\add*, I will bring on you
\add an enemy army\add* 
\q2 that will destroy your young men and cause their mothers to weep.
\q I will cause you to suddenly experience great suffering/pain and become very terrified.
\q
\v 9 A woman who has seven children will become faint and ◄gasp for breath/be hardly able to breathe►;
\q2 \add it will be as though\add* her daylight will become darkness,
\q because most of her children will be dead, 
\q2 and she will be disgraced and humiliated \f + \fr doublet \f*. 
\q And her children who are still alive, I will enable your enemies to kill them.
\q2 \add That will surely happen because\add* I, Yahweh, have said it.’ ”
\s Jeremiah's complaint and Yahweh's reply 
\p
\v 10 I said to my mother, “I am very sad; 
\q I wish that you had not given birth to me; 
\q2 everyone in this land opposes me and quarrels with me. 
\q I am not a person who lends \add money to people and threatens to sue/harm them if they do not pay me back when they
should\add*, 
\q2 and I am not a person who borrows \add money from others and then refuses to pay it
back\add*, 
\q but everyone \f + \fr hyperbole \f* curses me.” 
\p
\v 11 But Yahweh replied to me, 
\q “Jeremiah, I will take care of you. 
\q And at times when your enemies have troubles and disasters, 
\q2 they will \add come to you and\add* plead for you \add to help
them\add*. 
\q
\v 12 And Judah's enemies, who are \add as strong as\add* iron or bronze,
\add will attack Judah\add* from the north, 
\q2 no one will be able to stop them. 
\q
\v 13 I will give all the valuable possessions \add of the people of
Judah\add* to their enemies, 
\q2 without them paying for it. 
\q Their valuable possessions will be the payment/reward \add that I will give
them\add* 
\q2 because of all the sins that you have committed throughout your country.
\q
\v 14 I will tell your enemies to force you to become their prisoners,
\q2 and to take you to other lands that you do not even know about,
\q2 and force you to become their slaves. 
\q That will happen because I am extremely angry \add with you\add*;
\q2 my being angry is like \f + \fr simile \f* a fire that will burn forever.”
\s Another complaint by Jeremiah, and Yahweh's reply 
\q
\v 15 Then I said, “Yahweh, you know \add what is happening to me\add*.
\q2 Please come and ◄help me/take care of me►. 
\q2 Punish those who are ◄persecuting me/causing me to suffer►. 
\q Please do not continue to be patient with them 
\q2 and do not allow me to die now. 
\q It is ◄for your sake/because I serve you► that I am suffering.
\q
\v 16 Yahweh my God, you are the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels;
\q and when you spoke to me, 
\q2 I was delighted with your message; it caused me to be joyful,
\q and I eagerly accepted \f + \fr metaphor \f* what you said 
\q2 because I belong to you. [IDI, MTY] 
\q
\v 17 When the people were carousing together, 
\q2 I never joined them; 
\q I sat alone, because you \f + \fr metonymy \f* are the one who controls what I do.
\q2 I was very angry with those people because of their sins. 
\q
\v 18 So, ◄why do you \add allow\add* me to continue to suffer?/I do not understand why you allow me to continue to suffer.►
\f + \fr rhetorical question \f* 
\q2 It seems that \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* my wounds cannot be healed. 
\q \add Sometimes you help me, sometimes you do not help me\add*.
\q2 It seems that you are as undependable as a brook that has water in it only during certain seasons;
\q2 you are like a spring that has dried up.” 
\b
\p
\v 19 Then Yahweh replied to me saying this: 
\q “If you begin again to \add trust in\add* me, 
\q I will restore you, 
\q2 in order that you can continue to serve me. 
\q If you proclaim good/valuable messages and not worthless ones,
\q2 you will continue to be the one who speaks what I tell you to say.
\q You must cause the people to pay attention to what \bd you\bd* say;
\q2 you must not pay attention to what \bd they\bd* say. 
\q
\v 20 They will fight against you, 
\q2 but I will protect you, like \f + \fr simile \f* people are protected from their enemies by a bronze wall.
\q They will not defeat you, 
\q2 because I will be with you, 
\q2 and I will protect and rescue \f + \fr doublet \f* you. 
\q
\v 21 Truly, I will keep you safe from those wicked people, 
\q2 I will rescue you when you are seized by cruel people. 
\q \add That will happen because\add* I, Yahweh, have said it.”
