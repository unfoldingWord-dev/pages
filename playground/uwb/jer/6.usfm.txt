\c 6  
\s Jeremiah warned the people of Jerusalem 
\q
\v 1 You people in Jerusalem who are from the tribe of Benjamin,
\q2 flee from this city! 
\q Blow the trumpets in Tekoa \add city south of Jerusalem\add*!
\q Send up a \add smoke\add* signal in Beth-Haccherem \add town\add*
\q2 \add to warn the people of the coming danger\add*! 
\q A powerful army will come upon you from the north, 
\q2 and they will cause great destruction. 
\q
\v 2  \add Jerusalem is like\add* a beautiful pasture \add full of
sheep\add*, 
\q2 but it will soon be destroyed. 
\q
\v 3  \add Enemy kings, not\add* shepherds \f + \ft metaphor \f*, will come \add with their
armies\add* and set up their tents around the city, 
\q2 and \add each king will choose a part of the city for his soldiers to destroy
like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* shepherds divide their pastures for their flocks of sheep.
\b
\q
\v 4  \add The kings will tell their troops\add*, 
\q2 "Get ready for the battle. 
\q2 We should attack them before noontime. 
\q But if \add we arrive there late in the afternoon\add* 
\q2 when the shadows are becoming long, 
\q
\v 5 we will attack them at night 
\q2 and tear down their fortresses." 
\b
\s Yahweh predicts what will happen to Jerusalem 
\p
\v 6 Yahweh, the commander of the armies of angels in heaven, says this:
\q "I will command those soldiers to cut down the trees \add outside
Jerusalem\add* 
\q2 and to build dirt ramps up to the top of the city walls 
\q2 \add in order that they can enter the city\add*. 
\q This city must be punished 
\q2 because everyone there continually oppresses others. 
\q
\v 7  \add It is as though\add* the wicked things that the people do
\q2 pour out of the city like \f + \ft simile \f* water flows out of a spring.
\q \add The noise from people doing\add* violent and destructive actions is heard everywhere.
\q2 I continually see people who are suffering and wounded. 
\q
\v 8 Listen to what I am warning you, you people of \f + \ft apostrophe \f* Jerusalem,
\q2 because if you do not listen, I will reject you 
\q and cause your land to become desolate, 
\q2 a land where no one lives." 
\b
\p
\v 9 Yahweh, the commander of the armies of angels in heaven, says this:
\q2 "I will tell \add your enemies\add* to cause your country to become as desolate \f + \ft simile \f* as a vineyard from which all the
grapes have been completely stripped from the vines. 
\q \add Their soldiers will seize the possessions of\add* those who remain in Israel
\add after the others have been exiled\add* 
\q2 like \f + \ft simile \f* farmers go to the vines again to pick any grapes \add that were left\f + \ft Or: not
picked \f*\add*." 
\b
\q
\v 10  \add Then I said, "If I speak to the Israeli people\add* to warn them,
\q2 who will listen to me?\f + \ft Or: No one will listen to me. \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* 
\q \add It is as though\add* their ears are closed, 
\q2 and as a result they cannot hear \add what I say\add*. 
\q They scorn Yahweh's messages; 
\q2 they do not want to listen to them at all. 
\q
\v 11 So now I am extremely angry, like Yahweh is angry, 
\q2 and I cannot restrain it any longer." 
\b
\q \add So\add* Yahweh said \add to me\add*, 
\q2 "Tell everyone that you are very angry with them. 
\q2 Tell the children in the streets and the young men who gather together.
\q Tell the men and their wives; 
\q2 tell the very old people \f + \ft doublet \f*, also. 
\q
\v 12  \add Tell the men that\add* I will give their houses to \add their
enemies\add*, 
\q2 and I will give their property\f + \ft Or: fields \f* and their wives to them, also,
\q when I punish [IDI] the people who live in this land. 
\q
\v 13 Everyone is trying to get money by tricking others, 
\q2 from the most \add important people\add* to the least \add important
people\add*; 
\q even the prophets and the priests are trying to deceive \add people to get
money\add*. 
\q
\v 14  \add They act as though the sins of my people are like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* small wounds that they do not need to put bandages on.
\q They continually \add greet people by\add* saying 'I hope things are going well with you,'
\q2 when things are not going well. 
\q
\v 15 They should be \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* ashamed about the disgusting things that they do,
\q2 but they are not ashamed at all. 
\q2 They do not even know how to blush\f + \ft Or: show on their faces that they are ashamed \f*.
\q So, they also will be among those who will be killed. 
\q2 They will be destroyed when I punish them." 
\b
\p
\v 16 This is also what Yahweh said \add to the Israeli people:\add*
\q "Stand at the crossroads and look \add at the people who pass
by\add*. 
\q2 Ask them what was the good behavior \add that their ancestors
had\add* long ago. 
\q \add And when they tell you\add*, behave that way. 
\q2 If you do that, you will find rest for your souls. 
\q But you replied, 'We do not want to do that!' 
\q
\v 17 I sent \add my prophets who were like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* watchmen.
\q2 They said, 'Listen carefully when we blow the trumpets \add to warn you that your enemies are
approaching\add*,' 
\q2 but you said, 'No, we do not want to listen.' 
\q
\v 18 Therefore, you people in the other nations, listen to this:
\q2 Pay attention to what is going to happen to the \add Israeli
people\add*. 
\q
\v 19 Listen, all of you! 
\q2 I am going to cause disasters to happen to the Israeli people.
\q2 That is what will happen to them because they have refused to listen to what I told them.
\q2 They have refused to obey my laws. 
\q
\v 20 You Israeli people, when you burn frankincense that came from
\add far away in\add* Sheba 
\q2 and \add when you offer to me\add* sweet-smelling anointing oil that came from far away,
\q2 I will not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* be pleased with your sacrifices. 
\q I will not accept the sacrifices that are completely burned on the altar;
\q2 I am not pleased with \add any of\add* your sacrifices. 
\b
\p
\v 21 Therefore, I will put obstacles on the roads on which my people will travel.
\q2 Men and their sons and people's neighbors and friends will stumble over those obstacles and fall down;
\q everyone will die." 
\b
\p
\v 22 Yahweh also says this: 
\q "You will see a huge army marching \add towards you\add* from the north.
\q2 An army of a great nation very far away is preparing \add to attack
you\add*. 
\q
\v 23 They have bows \add and arrows\add* and spears; 
\q2 they are very cruel, and do not act mercifully to anyone. 
\q As they ride along on their horses, 
\q2 the horses' feet sound like the roaring of the ocean \add waves\add*;
\q they are riding in battle formation 
\q2 to attack you people of Jerusalem." 
\b
\q
\v 24  \add The people of Jerusalem say\add*, 
\q "We have heard reports about the enemy; 
\q2 so we are very frightened, with the result that we are weak.
\q We are very afraid, and worried, 
\q2 like \f + \ft simile \f* women who are about to give birth to babies. 
\q
\v 25  \add So one person says to another\add*, 
\q2 'Do not go out into the fields! Do not go on the roads, 
\q because the enemy soldiers have swords \add and they are everywhere\add*;
\q2 they are coming from all directions, and we are extremely afraid.'Â "
\q
\v 26 So I say, "My dear people, put on rough clothes and sit in ashes
\add to show that you are sorry for your sins\add*. 
\q Mourn and cry very much, 
\q2 like \f + \ft simile \f* \add a woman would cry\add* if her only son had died,
\q because your enemies are very near, 
\q2 and they are going to destroy \add everything\add*." 
\b
\p
\v 27  \add Then Yahweh said to me\add*, 
\q "\add Jeremiah\add*, I have caused you to become like \f + \ft metaphor \f* someone who heats metal very hot
\add to completely burn the impurities\add*. 
\q2 You will examine my people's behavior. 
\q
\v 28 You will find out that they are very stubborn rebels, 
\q2 they are always slandering others. 
\q \add Their inner beings\add* are as hard as bronze or iron; 
\q2 they all continually deceive others. 
\q
\v 29 A metalworker causes the bellows to blow very hard to \add make the fire very hot
to\add* completely burn up the impurities \f + \ft metaphor \f*. 
\q But just as a fire does not cause all the waste material to run off,
\q2 it is impossible to separate \add the righteous people and punish only the wicked
people\add*. 
\q
\v 30 I, Yahweh, have rejected them; 
\q2 I say that they are like \f + \ft metaphor \f* worthless silver."
