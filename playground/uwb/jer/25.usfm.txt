\c 25  
\s A prediction about being exiled for 70 years 
\p
\v 1 After Jehoiakim had been ruling Judah for almost four years, Yahweh gave me this message for all the people of Judah. It
was during the year that King Nebuchadnezzar started to rule in Babylon.
\v 2 I spoke this message to all the people in Jerusalem and other places in Judah:
\v 3 “Yahweh has been giving me messages for twenty-three years. He started giving me messages when Josiah, the son of Amon,
had been ruling Judah for almost thirteen years. And I have faithfully told you those messages, but you have not paid any
attention to them. 
\p
\v 4 Many times Yahweh has sent to you the prophets who served him, but you have not listened to them or paid any attention to
what they said. 
\v 5 Each time their message was this: ‘Turn from all your evil behavior \f + \fk metaphor \f*, from all the evil things that you have
continually been doing. If you do that, you will be able to stay in this land that Yahweh gave to you and to your ancestors,
\add to belong to you\add* forever. 
\v 6 Do not cause Yahweh to become angry by serving and worshiping idols that you have made with your hands. If you do not
cause him to be angry, he will not punish/harm you.’ 
\p
\v 7 And Yahweh says, ‘But you would not pay attention to the messages that I
\add gave to those prophets\add*. You caused me to become extremely angry by your worshiping idols that you had made with your
own hands. That resulted in my punishing you. 
\p
\v 8 So now, I, the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels, say that because you have not paid attention to what I said,
\v 9 I will gather all \add the armies of\add* the nations that will come from the northeast. I have appointed King
Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon to lead them. I have appointed him to do my work for me. I will bring those armies to attack this
land and nearby countries. I will completely destroy them, and cause them to be places that people are horrified about, and
that people will ◄ridicule/act contemptuously toward►, places that will be ruined forever.
\v 10 I will cause happy singing and laughing to cease in your land. There will no longer be brides and bridegrooms talking
\add joyfully\add*. There will not be the sound of people grinding
\add grain\add* with millstones. There will be no lamps lit \add in your
houses\add*. 
\v 11 All of this land will become a desert where no one will live. And the people of Israel and of the nearby countries will
\add will be exiled to Babylonia and\add* ◄work for/be slaves of► the kings of Babylon for seventy years.
\p
\v 12 Then, after \add they have been in Babylonia for\add* seventy years, I will punish the king of Babylonia and his people
for the sins that they have committed. I will cause Babylonia to become a wasteland/desert forever.
\v 13 I will cause them to experience all the terrible things that Jeremiah has written about—all the punishments that he
predicted will happen to all those nations. 
\v 14 The leaders of many nations will cause the people of Babylonia to become their slaves, like the people of Babylonia
caused my people to become slaves. I will punish them like they deserve for
\add having caused my people to suffer\add*.’ ” 
\s The wine that symbolized God's punishment 
\p
\v 15 Then Yahweh, the God we Israelis \add worship\add*, gave me
\add a vision. In the vision he was holding a cup of wine\add*. He said, “Take from me this cup that is full of
\add wine that represents\add* punishment \f + \fk metonymy \f*. I will cause all
\add the leaders of\add* the nations to which I will send you to drink
\add some of\add* the wine in this cup. 
\v 16 When they drink \add the wine\add*, they will stagger and act like crazy people, because
\add they will realize that\add* I will ◄massacre many of their people/cause many of their people to be killed► \f + \fk metonymy \f* with
swords.” 
\p
\v 17 So, \add in the vision\add*, I took that cup \add full of wine\add* from Yahweh, and I took it to all the nations to
which he sent me, and caused the leaders of those nations to drink
\add some of that wine\add*. 
\v 18  \add I went to\add* Jerusalem and the other towns in Judah, and the king and the other officials drank
\add some of the wine\add* from that cup. And, starting from that day, they all
\add eventually\add* were removed from having authority, and became people whom others ◄ridiculed/acted contemptuously
towards►, who were despised, and cursed. 
\v 19  \add In the vision I went to\add* Egypt \add and gave some of the
wine\add* to the king and his officials and many of his people, 
\v 20 and to foreigners who were living there. \add In the vision I also went
to\add* Uz land and to Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and Ashdod \add cities and gave some of the
wine\add* to the kings \add of those places\add*. 
\v 21  \add Then in the vision I went to the\add* Edom, Moab, and Ammon
\add people-groups\add*, 
\v 22 and to Tyre and Sidon \add cities\add* and to areas across the
\add Mediterranean\add* Sea, and \add gave some of the wine\add* to the kings
\add of those places\add*. 
\v 23  \add In the vision I then went\add* to Dedan, Tema, and Buz
\add cities in Arabia\add* and to other distant places \f + \ft (OR, places where people cut their hair short) \f*,
\add and gave some of the wine to leaders in those areas\add*. 
\v 24  \add In the vision I also went to other places in\add* Arabia and to the
\add kings of tribes\add* in the desert 
\v 25 and to the kings of the Zimri, Elam, and Media \add people-groups\add*,
\v 26 and to kings in countries to the north that are near \add to
Israel\add* and to countries that are far from \add Israel\add*, one after the other—I went to all the kingdoms in the world
\f + \fk hyperbole \f*. And finally, \add in my vision I went to\add* Babylon, and gave
\add some of\add* the wine to the king of Babylon—the wine \add that symbolized the punishment that Yahweh would give them
because\add* he was angry with them \f + \fk metonymy \f*. 
\p
\v 27 Then \add in the vision\add* Yahweh said to me, “Tell them that this is what the Almighty Commander of the armies of
angels the God whom we Israelis \add worship\add*, says: ‘Drink from this cup
\add some of the wine that represents the punishment that I will give
you\add*. Drink a lot of it and become drunk and vomit. You will fall down and not get up again, because I will cause you to be
killed in wars \f + \fk metonymy \f* that I will send to you. 
\v 28 If any of those to whom you give this wine \f + \fk metonymy \f* refuse to drink it, tell them that the Almighty Commander of the armies
of angels says that they must drink it. 
\v 29 I am starting to bring disaster to my own \f + \fk metonymy \f* city. \add Do you think
that\add* you should not be punished \f + \fk rhetorical question \f*? No, you will surely be punished \f + \fk litotes \f* because I am sending wars to all the nations
on the earth. \add That will surely happen because\add* I, the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels, have said it.’
\p
\v 30 Now tell them all those things that I have said, and also say this to them:
\q ‘Yahweh will \add shout to them\add* from his holy dwelling \add in
heaven\add* \f + \fk metonymy \f* 
\q2 and \add it will sound like\add* the roar of a lion. 
\q He will shout like \f + \fk simile \f* people shout when they are treading on grapes
\add to make juice for wine\add*; 
\q2 he will shout to everyone on the earth. 
\q
\v 31 Even people in very remote places around the earth will hear him shouting,
\q2 because he will say why he will judge and punish all the nations.
\q He will cause the wicked people to be slaughtered with swords.
\q2 \add That will surely happen because\add* Yahweh has said it.’
\p
\v 32 Then tell them that this is what the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels says:
\q ‘Listen to this! 
\q2 Disasters will happen to one nation after another. 
\q Punishment \add from me\add* will arise like \f + \fk metaphor \f* a great storm
\q2 from the most distant places on the earth. 
\q
\v 33 When that happens, \add the corpses of\add* those whom I have caused to be slaughtered will fill the earth from the east
to the west. 
\q2 And no one will mourn for them, and no one will gather their corpses to bury them. They will be
\add scattered\add* on the ground like manure. 
\q
\v 34 You \add evil\add* leaders, weep and moan! 
\q2 You who should take care of my people, \add fall down and\add* roll in the dust/dirt.
\q It is time for you to be slaughtered; 
\q2 you will fall down and be shattered like a fragile vase \add shatters when it falls to the
ground\add*. 
\q
\v 35 You will not find any place to hide, 
\q2 there will be no place to which you can escape. 
\q
\v 36  \add People will\add* listen to your leaders crying 
\q2 when I, Yahweh, am ruining your nation. 
\q
\v 37 Your peaceful meadows will become a wasteland/desert 
\q2 because I will severely punish \f + \fk metonymy \f* it. 
\q
\v 38 I will leave \add my dwelling like\add* \f + \fk simile \f* a lion leaves its den
\add to attack other animals\add*, 
\q2 and I will cause your land to become desolate 
\q when I, because I am very angry with you, cause your enemies \add to slaughter you with
their\add* swords.’ ”
