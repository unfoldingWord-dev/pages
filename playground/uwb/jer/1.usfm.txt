\s Introduction 
\p
\v 1 I, Jeremiah, the son of Hilkiah, \add am writing\add* these messages. I am a priest, from Anathoth
\add town\add* in the area where the tribe of Benjamin \add lives\add*.
\v 2 Yahweh started to give me these messages when Josiah had been ruling Judah for almost thirteen years.
\v 3 Yahweh continued to give me more messages when Josiah's son Jehoiakim was the king, and he continued to do that until
Zedekiah had been the king of Judah for almost eleven years. It was in August of that year that the people of Jerusalem were
◄exiled\f + \ft Or: taken \f* as prisoners► \add to Babylonia\add*. 
\s Yahweh chose Jeremiah to be his prophet 
\p
\v 4  \add One day\add* Yahweh gave me this message: 
\q
\v 5 “I knew you before I \add finished\add* forming you in your mother's womb.
\q2 Before you were born, I ◄set you apart\f + \ft Or: chose \f* you► 
\q2 and I appointed you to be my prophet 
\q2 \add whose messages would be\add* for all nations.” 
\p
\v 6 I replied, “O, Yahweh my God, I am not \add qualified to\add* speak
\add for you\add*, because I am very young!” 
\p
\v 7 Yahweh replied, “Do not say that, because you must go to everyone to whom I will send you, and you must tell them
everything that I tell you to say. 
\v 8 And you must not be afraid of the people \add to whom you will
speak\add*, because I will protect you from \add being harmed by
them\add*. \add This will surely happen because\add* I, Yahweh, have said it!”
\p
\v 9 Then \add it was as though\add* Yahweh touched my mouth and said, “Listen to me! I have put my message into your mouth.
\v 10 Today I am appointing you to warn nations and kingdoms. You will tell them that I will completely destroy and get rid of
\\f + \\ft doublet \\f* some of them and that I will establish \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* others and cause them to be strong.”
\p
\v 11 Then Yahweh said to me, “Jeremiah, what do you see?” 
\p I replied, “I see a branch from an almond tree.” 
\p
\v 12 Yahweh said, “That is correct. And \add because the word for 'almond' resembles the word for
'watching'\add*, it means that I am watching \add what will happen\add*, and I will make certain that what I have said to you
\add about destroying nations\add* will happen.” 
\p
\v 13 Then Yahweh spoke to me again and said, “What do you see now?”
\p I replied, “I see a pot full of boiling \add water\add* \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f*. It is tipping
\add toward me\add* from the north.” 
\p
\v 14 Yahweh replied, “Yes! \add It means that\add* from the north great trouble\f + \ft Or: destruction \f* will
\add spread\add* over this land, \add like boiling water\add* \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* pouring
\add from a pot\add*. 
\q
\v 15 Listen to what I say: 
\q2 I am summoning \add the armies of\add* the kingdoms that are north
\add of Judah\add* to come to Jerusalem. 
\q Their kings will set up their thrones at the gates of this city
\add to indicate that they are now the kings of Judah\add*. 
\q2 \add Their armies\add* will attack \add and break down\add* the walls of this city, and they will do the same thing to all
the other towns in Judah. 
\q
\v 16 I will punish \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* my people because of all the evil things that they have done;
\q they have abandoned me and they worship gods\f + \ft Or: idols \f*. 
\q2 They worship idols that they have made with their own hands!
\p
\v 17 So, get up and put on your clothes \add to get ready for action\add*! Then go to the people of Judah and tell them
everything that I tell you to say. Do not be afraid of them, because
\add if you are afraid of them\add*, I will cause you to be truly terrified in front of them!
\v 18 But listen! I will cause you to be \add strong, like\add* \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* a city that has strong walls around it. You will be
\add as strong as\add* \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* an iron pillar or a bronze wall. None of the kings or officials or priests will be able to defeat
you. 
\v 19 They will oppose you, but they will not be able to defeat you, because I will be with you and will protect you.
\add That will surely happen because\add* I, Yahweh, have said it!”
