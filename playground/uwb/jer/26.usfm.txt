\c 26  
\s Jeremiah escaped being killed 
\p
\v 1 Soon after Jehoiakim became the king of Judah, Yahweh gave me this message:
\v 2 “This is what I, Yahweh, am telling you: Stand in the courtyard
\add in front\add* of my temple, and speak to all the people from the various towns in Judah who come there to worship me. Tell
them everything that I tell you; do not omit anything. 
\v 3 If you do tell them everything, perhaps they will pay attention, and each one of them will turn away from his evil
behavior. Then I will change my mind, and not bring on them the disaster that I was planning to bring on them because of the
evil things that they have done. 
\v 4-5 Say to them, ‘This is what Yahweh says: I sent to you the prophets who serve me, to tell you what you should do. I sent
them to you many times, but you have not paid attention to what they said. If you will not pay attention to what I say and do
not obey the message that I have given to you, and if you do not pay attention to what the prophets say,
\v 6 I will destroy this temple like I destroyed Shiloh, \add the place where the Sacred Tent was
put\add*. And I will cause Jerusalem to be a place whose name people in every nation on the earth will say when they curse
someone.’ ” 
\p
\v 7  \add When I did what Yahweh told me to do\add*, the priests, the
\add false\add* prophets, and many other people listened to me as I told them that message outside the temple.
\v 8 But as soon as I finished telling them everything that Yahweh had commanded me to say, they all seized me and said, “You
must be executed! 
\v 9 Why \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* are you prophesying that this temple will be \add destroyed\add* like Shiloh was destroyed? Why are you saying
that this city will be destroyed, and that no one will live here anymore? \f + \ft (OR, You should not be prophesying) \f* \f + \fk rhetorical question \f*” All the
people surrounded me as I stood in front of the temple. 
\p
\v 10 When the officials of Judah heard about all this that was happening, they rushed from the palace and sat down at the gate
of the temple named The New Gate, \add to judge my case\add*. 
\v 11 The priests and the prophets told the officials and the other people who were there, “This man should be executed,
because he has prophesied that this city \add will be destroyed\add*, and you yourselves \f + \fk metonymy \f* have heard him say that!”
\p
\v 12 Then I replied to the officials and the other people. I said to them, “Yahweh sent me to prophesy all the things that you
heard me say about \add what will happen to\add* this temple and this city.
\v 13 But if you change your behavior and stop sinning, and start to obey Yahweh our God, he will change his mind, and not send
to you the disasters that he said that he would send. 
\v 14 As for me, I am not able to free myself from your grasp. So you can do to me whatever you want to do.
\v 15 But you need to know that if you kill me, you will be killing a man \f + \fk synecdoche \f* who ◄is innocent/has not done anything wrong►.
And you and everyone else in this city will be guilty, because the truth is that it was Yahweh who sent me to speak every word
that you have heard me say.” 
\p
\v 16 Then the officials and the other people said to the priests and the false prophets, “This man does not deserve to be
executed, because he has spoken to us the message \f + \fk metonymy \f* that Yahweh gave him!”
\p
\v 17 Then some of the elders stood up and spoke to all the people who were gathered there.
\v 18 They said, “◄Remember/Think about► what Micah, \add the prophet\add* from Moresheth
\add town\add*, prophesied during the years that Hezekiah was the king of Judah. He told the people of Judah this:
\q ‘This is what the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels says:
\q2 \add Some day\add* Zion \add Hill\add* will be plowed like fields
\add are plowed\add*; 
\q2 Jerusalem will become a heap of ruins. 
\q There will be a large clump/group of trees on top of the hill where the temple is now.’
\m
\v 19 But did \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* King Hezekiah or anyone else in Judah kill Micah
\add for saying that\add*? No! Instead, Hezekiah revered Yahweh, and pleaded that he would ◄act mercifully toward/not destroy►
them. So, Yahweh changed his mind about sending to them the terrible disaster that he said he would send. And now
\add if we kill Jeremiah\add*, we are going to bring a terrible disaster on ourselves!”
\p
\v 20  \add At that time\add*, Uriah the son of Shemaiah from Kiriath-Jearim
\add city\add* was also prophesying/proclaiming messages \f + \fk metonymy \f* from Yahweh. He was predicting that the city and the rest of the
land would experience the same disasters that I was predicting. 
\v 21 When King Jehoiakim and his army officers and officials heard what Uriah was saying, the king sent someone to kill Uriah.
But Uriah heard about it, and became very afraid, and he ◄escaped/ran away► to Egypt.
\v 22 Then King Jehoiakim sent Elnathan the son of Acbor along with several other men to Egypt.
\v 23 They captured Uriah and took him back \add to Jerusalem\add* to King Jehoiakim. The king then
\add commanded a soldier to\add* kill Uriah with a sword. Then they buried his corpse in a place where poor people are buried.
\p
\v 24 However, Ahikam the son of Shaphan defended me, and persuaded the officials not to allow \f + \fk metonymy \f* the mob to murder me.
