\v 1 These are messages that Yahweh gave to the prophet Jeremiah about
\add other\add* nations. 
\s Messages about Egypt 
\p
\v 2 After Jehoiakim, son of King Josiah, had been ruling Judah for almost four years, this message about Egypt was given to me
\add by Yahweh\add*. It was when the army of King Neco of Egypt was defeated by the army of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon
along the Euphrates River. 
\p \add This is what Yahweh said: "The officers of the army of Egypt are saying to their
troops\add*, 
\q
\v 3 'Prepare your shields 
\q2 and march out to fight the battle! 
\q
\v 4 Put harnesses on your horses, 
\q2 and get on their backs. 
\q Get into your positions\f + \ft Or: Line up \f* \add for the battle\add*; 
\q2 put on your helmets. 
\q Sharpen your spears, 
\q2 and put on your armor!' 
\q
\v 5 But what \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* do I see? 
\q2 I see that the soldiers of Egypt will be terrified and will be fleeing.
\q Even the bravest of their soldiers will be running away, 
\q2 without even looking backward! 
\q I, Yahweh, say that their soldiers will be terrified on all sides!
\q
\v 6 Even the fastest runners will try to run away, 
\q2 but even the greatest of their warriors will not escape. 
\q In the north, by the Euphrates River, 
\q2 they will stumble and fall. 
\b
\q
\v 7 What group is this that will be covering the land 
\q2 like the water of the Nile \add River\add* covers the land when it floods?
\q
\v 8 It is the army of Egypt 
\q2 that will be covering the land like a surging\f + \ft Or: huge \f* flood, 
\q and they will boast that they will cover the earth 
\q2 and will destroy cities and the people \add who live in them\add*.
\q
\v 9 You riders of horses, charge\f + \ft Or: rush \f* \add into the battle\add*!
\q2 You drivers of chariots, drive furiously! 
\q All you warriors from Ethiopia and Libya 
\q2 who carry your shields, 
\q you warriors from Lydia 
\q2 who shoot arrows, 
\q you come! 
\q
\v 10 But, \add you need to know that\add* this is the day when I, Yahweh, the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels, will
get revenge on my enemies. 
\q With my sword \f + \ft personification \f* I will kill \add my enemies\add* until I am satisfied;
\q2 my sword will \add be like a monster that\add* \f + \ft metaphor, personification \f* drinks the blood
\add of the animals it kills\add* until it is no longer thirsty.
\q \add The enemy soldiers who will be killed\add* in the north beside the Euphrates River
\q2 \add will be like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* a sacrifice to me, the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels.
\b
\q
\v 11 You people [IDI] of Egypt, 
\q2 go up to the Gilead \add region\add* to obtain medicine; 
\q but it will be useless to take all those medicines; 
\q2 you will not be healed. 
\q
\v 12 People in the other nations will hear how you were humiliated.
\q2 People all over the earth will hear you wailing. 
\q Your mighty warriors will stumble over each other 
\q2 and they will all fall down together." 
\b
\p
\v 13 Then Yahweh gave to the prophet Jeremiah this message about King Nebuchadnezzar when he planned to attack Egypt
\add with his army\add*: 
\q
\v 14 "Shout this message throughout Egypt! 
\q2 Proclaim it in Migdol, Memphis, and Tahpenes \add cities\add*!
\q 'Get into your positions\f + \ft Or: Line up \f* \add for the battle\add*; 
\q2 Prepare to defend yourselves, 
\q2 because everyone around you will be killed.' \f + \ft personification, metonymy \f* 
\q
\v 15 Your god is a bull; 
\q2 Why does he fall down? 
\q He will not be able to stand up, 
\q2 because Yahweh will knock him down. 
\q
\v 16 The soldiers from other countries will stumble and fall over each other,
\q2 and then they will say to each other, 
\q "Let's get up and go back to our own people, to our own land.
\q2 Let's get away from the swords of our enemies!" 
\q
\v 17 There \add in Egypt\add* they will say, 
\q2 "The king of Egypt talks loudly, 
\q2 but when our army had an opportunity \add to defeat our enemies\add*, they failed."
\b
\q
\v 18 I, the King, who am called the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels,
\q2 say this: 
\q 'As surely as I live, someone's army will be coming \add to fight against the army of
Egypt\add*. 
\q2 They \add will be extremely powerful\add*, 
\q2 \add as though they were as tall as Tabor Hill\add*, 
\q2 or as high as Carmel \add Mountain\add* close to the \add Mediterranean\add* Sea.
\q
\v 19 All you people who live in Egypt, 
\q2 pack your possessions\f + \ft Or: clothes \f* and prepare to be exiled. 
\q Memphis will be destroyed; 
\q2 it will become a ruin, and no people will be living there. 
\b
\q
\v 20 Egypt is like \f + \ft simile \f* a beautiful young cow, 
\q2 but \add a powerful king\add* from the northeast will come to attack it
\q2 like a horsefly \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add bites a cow\add*. 
\q
\v 21 The mercenaries\f + \ft Or: soldiers from other countries who have been hired \f* will become like \f + \ft simile \f* fat calves;
\q2 but they also will turn around and run away; 
\q they will not stand there \add and fight\add*, 
\q2 because it will be a day when there will be a great disaster for Egypt,
\q2 a day when their people will be greatly punished. 
\q
\v 22  \add The soldiers of\add* Egypt will run away, 
\q2 as silently as a snake slithers\f + \ft Or: crawls \f* away. 
\q The army of the enemy will advance; 
\q2 they will march along carrying their axes 
\q2 like \f + \ft simile \f* men who cut down trees. 
\q
\v 23 I, Yahweh, say that they will kill the soldiers \add of Egypt\add*
\q2 as though \f + \ft simile \f* they were a forest of trees, 
\q2 because the enemy soldiers will be as numerous as \add a swarm
of\add* locusts. 
\q
\v 24 The people of Egypt will be humiliated; 
\q2 they will be conquered by people from the northeast.' 
\b
\p
\v 25 I, the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels, the God whom the Israelis
\add worship\add*, say, 'I will punish Amon, \add the god whom the
people\add* of Thebes \add city\add* worship, and all the other gods in Egypt. I will punish the king of Egypt and all those
who trust in him. 
\v 26 I will cause them to be captured by those who want to kill them—Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, and his army
officers. But many years later, people will live in Egypt again.
\add That will surely happen because\add* I, Yahweh, have said it.'
\q
\v 27 But you people of Israel who serve me, 
\q2 do not be at all dismayed \f + \ft doublet \f* now, 
\q because some day I will bring you back from distant places; 
\q2 I will bring your descendants from the land to which they were exiled.
\q2 Then you Israeli people will again live peacefully and safely,
\q2 and there will not be any nation to cause you to be terrified.
\q
\v 28 I, Yahweh, say to you people of Israel who serve me, 
\q 'Do not be afraid, 
\q2 because I will be with you. 
\q I will completely destroy the nations among whom I have scattered you,
\q2 but I will not completely get rid of you. 
\q I will punish you, but I will punish you only as severely as you deserve:
\q2 it would be wrong if I did not punish you at all.' "
