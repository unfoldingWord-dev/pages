\c 13  
\s Jeremiah's linen waistcloth 
\p
\v 1  \add One day\add* Yahweh said to me, “Go and buy a linen waistcloth. Put it on, but do not wash it.”
\v 2 So I bought a \add very nice\add* waistcloth, which is what Yahweh told me to do, and I put it on.
\p
\v 3 Then later Yahweh gave me another message. 
\v 4 He said, “Go to the small Perath Stream \add near Jerusalem\add* and hide your waistcloth in a crevice/hole in the rocks.”
\v 5 So I went to the stream and did what Yahweh told me to do. 
\p
\v 6 A long time later, Yahweh said to me, “Go back to that stream and get the waistcloth that I told you to hide there.”
\v 7 So I went to the Perath Stream and dug out the waistcloth from the crevice/hole in which I had hidden it. But it was
ruined, and useless. 
\p
\v 8 Then Yahweh gave me this message: 
\v 9 “\add What happened to your waistcloth\add* shows that I will destroy the things that the people of Jerusalem and
\add other places in\add* Judah are very proud of. 
\v 10 Those wicked people refuse to pay attention to what I say. They stubbornly do just what they desire to do; they worship
other gods. Therefore, they will become completely useless, like your waistcloth.
\v 11 Just like a waistcloth clings closely/tightly to a man's waist, I wanted the people [MTY] of Israel and Judah to cling
closely to me. I wanted them to be my people, people who would praise me and honor me. But they would not pay attention to me.
\s The warning regarding wine bags 
\p
\v 12 So, tell this to them: ‘Yahweh, the God whom you Israeli people worship, says that every leather wineskin should be
filled with wine.’ And \add when you tell that to them\add*, they will reply, ‘◄Of course/Certainly► we know [RHQ] that all
wineskins should be filled with wine!’ 
\v 13 And then you must tell them, ‘No, that is not what Yahweh means. What he said means that he will cause this land to be
filled with people who are drunk. That will include \add all of you\add*—the king who sits on the throne that King David
previously sat on, the priests and the prophets, and even the common people of Jerusalem.’
\v 14 He is saying, ‘I will cause you to bash each other. Even parents will bash their children. I will not pity you or act
mercifully toward you at all; pitying you will not prevent me from getting rid of you.’ ”
\s A warning that the people of Judah will be exiled 
\q
\v 15  \add You people of Judah\add*, pay very careful attention [DOU].
\q2 Do not be proud, because Yahweh has spoken to you. 
\q
\v 16  \add It is as though\add* he is ready to bring darkness on you
\q2 and to cause you to stumble and fall \add as you walk on\add* the hills when it is becoming dark.
\q So praise/honor Yahweh your God before that happens. 
\q If you do not do that, you will look for light, 
\q2 but all you will see is darkness and gloom. 
\q
\v 17 And if you still refuse to heed what he says, 
\q2 \add what will happen to you because of\add* your being proud will cause me to cry when I am alone.
\q My eyes will be filled with tears 
\q2 because you, Yahweh's people, 
\q2 \add whom he takes care of like a shepherd takes care of\add* [MET] his flock,
\q2 will all be \add captured by your enemies and\add* taken to other countries.
\q
\v 18  \add You people of Judah\add*, say to the king and to his mother,
\q “Come down from sitting on your thrones 
\q2 and \add humbly\add* sit in the dust, 
\q2 because \add your enemies\add* will soon snatch from your heads your glorious crowns.”
\q
\v 19 The towns in the southern part of Judah will be surrounded by your enemies,
\q2 and no one will be able to get through their lines \add to rescue the people in those
towns\add*. 
\q You people of Judah will be captured and taken away; 
\q2 you will all be ◄exiled/taken to foreign countries►. 
\b
\q
\v 20  \add You leaders of Jerusalem\add*, open your eyes and look:
\q \add the enemy armies are ready to\add* march down from the north.
\q \add When that happens\add*, what will happen to [RHQ] the \add people of Judah who are
like\add* a beautiful flock of sheep, 
\q2 people that he gave to you to take care of? 
\q
\v 21 What will you say [RHQ] when Yahweh appoints people from other countries to rule over you,
\q2 people who you \add mistakenly\add* thought were your friends?
\q You will [RHQ] suffer very much pain, 
\q2 like a woman who is about to give birth to a baby. 
\q
\v 22 You will ask yourselves, “Why is this happening to us?” 
\q2 \add I will reply that\add* it is because of your many sins.
\q That is why \add soldiers of the invading armies\add* will lift up the skirts
\add of your women\add* and rape them. 
\q
\v 23 A man from Ethiopia certainly cannot [RHQ] change the color of his
\add black\add* skin, 
\q2 and a leopard certainly cannot [RHQ] change its spots. 
\q Similarly, you cannot start doing what is good, 
\q2 because you have always done what is evil. 
\b
\q
\v 24  \add Yahweh says\add*, “I will scatter you like chaff 
\q2 that is blown away by the wind from the desert. 
\q
\v 25 That is what is certainly going to happen to you, 
\q2 the things that I have determined will happen to you, 
\q2 because you have forgotten me, 
\q2 and you are trusting in false gods. 
\q
\v 26  \add It is as though\add* I myself will pull your skirts up over your faces
\q2 and cause you to be very ashamed because everyone will be able to see your sex organs.
\q
\v 27 I have seen that you \add act like men who are eager to commit
adultery\add*; 
\q2 you are like male horses that whinny when they desire \add to have sex
with\add* a female horse. 
\q I have seen that you worship disgusting idols in the fields and on the hills.
\q You people of Jerusalem, terrible things will happen to you! 
\q2 How long will it be [RHQ] until you are acceptable to me again?”
