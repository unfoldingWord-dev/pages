\c 8  
\p
\v 1 Yahweh says, “At the time \add that your corpses are scattered on the
ground\add*, 
\q \add your enemies will\add* break open the graves of your kings and other officials who lived in Judah,
\q2 and the graves of your priests and prophets and other people who lived there.
\q
\v 2 They will take out their bones \add from their graves\add* and
\add dishonor them by\add* scattering them on the ground under the sun and the moon and the stars—
\q2 those are the gods which my people loved and served and worshiped.
\q No one will gather up their bones and bury them \add again\add*;
\q2 they will remain scattered on the ground like dung. 
\q
\v 3 And all the people of this wicked nation \add who are still alive
and\add* whom I have exiled to other countries will say, 
\q2 ‘We would prefer to die than to continue to stay alive \add here in these
countries\add*.’ 
\q2 \add That will be true because\add* I, Yahweh, have said it.”
\s The people will not admit their sins 
\p
\v 4  \add Yahweh said to me, “Jeremiah\add*, tell the people that this is what I, Yahweh, am saying to them:
\q ‘When people fall down, they get up again, do they not \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*?
\q2 When people are going along a road and find out that they are walking on the wrong road, they go back
\add and find the correct road\add*, do they not \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*? 
\q
\v 5  \add Yes, they do\add*, so why do these people \add of Judah\add* continue
\add trusting in those idols that have deceived them\add*? 
\q2 They continue turning away from me, 
\q2 \add even though I have warned them\add*. 
\q
\v 6 I have listened carefully \f + \fr doublet \f* \add to what they say\add*,
\q2 but they do not say what they should say. 
\q Not one of them is sorry for having sinned. 
\q2 No one says, “I have done \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* wicked things.” 
\q They are \add sinning and\add* doing what they want to 
\q2 as fast as \f + \fr simile \f* a horse that is running into a battle. 
\q
\v 7 All the birds \add that fly south for the ◄winter/cold season►\add* know the time that they need to fly south,
\q2 and they all return at the right time the following year. 
\q But my people \add are not like those birds\add*! 
\q2 They do not know what I, Yahweh, require them to do. 
\b
\q
\v 8 Your men who teach you \add the laws that Moses wrote\add* have been saying false things
\add about those laws\add*. 
\q2 So, why \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* do they continue saying, “We are very wise because we have the laws of Yahweh”?
\q
\v 9 Those teachers, who think that \f + \fr irony \f* they are wise, will be ashamed/disgraced and dismayed when they are taken
\add to other countries by their enemies\add* 
\q2 because they sinned by rejecting what I told them. 
\q Truly, they were not \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* very wise to do that! 
\q
\v 10 So, I will give their wives to other men; 
\q2 I will give their fields to \add the enemy soldiers\add* who conquer them.
\q All the people, including those who are important and those who are not important, deceive others in order to obtain their
possessions. 
\q2 Even my prophets and my priests do that. 
\q
\v 11  \add They act as though the sins of my people\add* are not serious,
\q2 like \f + \fr metaphor \f* wounds that do not need to be cleaned and bandaged.
\q They tell the people that everything will go well with them, 
\q2 \add but that is not true\add*; things will not go well with them.
\q
\v 12 They should be \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* ashamed when they do disgusting things \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*,
\q2 but they do not even know how to show on their faces that they are ashamed
\add about their sins\add*. 
\q So, \add they will be killed, and\add* their corpses also will lie among the corpses of others who have been slaughtered
\add by their enemies\add*. 
\q2 They will be killed when I punish them. 
\q
\v 13 I will \add allow their enemies to\add* take away the figs and grapes that the people would have harvested from their
fields. 
\q2 Their fruit trees will all wither. 
\q They will not receive all the blessings that I prepared for them.
\q2 \add This will certainly happen because\add* I, Yahweh, have said it.’ ”
\b
\q
\v 14 Then the people will say, “◄Why should we wait here \add in these small
towns\add*?/We should not wait here \add in these small towns\add*.► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*
\q2 We should go to the cities that have high walls around them,
\q \add but even if we do that\add* we will be killed there, 
\q2 because Yahweh our God has decided that we must be destroyed;
\q \add it is as though\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f* he has given us a cup of poison to drink,
\q2 because we sinned against him. 
\q
\v 15 We hoped/desired that things would go well for us, 
\q2 but things have not gone well. 
\q We hoped that bad things would not happen to us anymore, 
\q2 but only things that terrify us \add are happening to us\add*.
\q
\v 16 People \add far north in Israel\add* in \add the city of\add* Dan can already hear the snorting of the horses of their
enemies \add who are preparing to attack us\add*. 
\q2 \add It is as though\add* the entire land of Judah is shaking as their army approaches;
\q2 they are coming to destroy our land and everything in it, the people and the cities.”
\b
\q
\v 17  \add Yahweh says\add*, “I will send \add those enemy soldiers to
Judah\add*, 
\q2 and they will be like \f + \fr metaphor \f* poisonous snakes among you. 
\q2 No one will be able to stop them from attacking you \f + \fr metaphor \f*; 
\q they will attack you like snakes do, \add and kill you\add*.”
\b
\s Jeremiah mourned for the people 
\q
\v 18 I grieve very much \add for the people of Judah\add*, and my grieving does not end.
\q2 I am very sad in my inner being [IDI]. 
\q
\v 19 Throughout our land, the people ask, 
\q “Has Yahweh abandoned Jerusalem? 
\q2 Is he, our city's king, no longer there?” 
\q Yahweh replies, “Why do the people cause me to become very angry by
\add worshiping\add* idols and foreign gods?” \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* 
\b
\q
\v 20 The people say, “The harvest season is finished, the ◄summer/hot season► has ended,
\q2 \add and we hoped that we would receive blessings from Yahweh\add*,
\q2 but he has not rescued us \add from our enemies\add*.” 
\b
\q
\v 21 I cry because my people have been crushed. 
\q2 I mourn, and I am completely dismayed. 
\q
\v 22 I ask, “Surely there is \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* medicinal balm in the Gilead
\add region\add*! 
\q2 Surely there are \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* doctors there!” 
\q But my people have been badly wounded \add in their spirits\add*,
\q2 and nothing can heal them.
