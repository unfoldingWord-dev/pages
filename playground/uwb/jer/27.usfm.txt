\c 27  
\s Jeremiah urged them to surrender to Nebuchadnezzar 
\p
\v 1 Soon after Zedekiah became the king of Judah, Yahweh gave a message to me.
\v 2 This is what he said to me: "Make a yoke\f + \ft Or: set of wooden bars to fasten around the neck of an ox \f*, but fasten it around
your own neck with leather straps. 
\v 3 Then send messages to the kings of Edom, Moab, Ammon, Tyre, and Sidon, by telling those messages to the ambassadors from
those countries who have come to Jerusalem to \add talk to\add* King Zedekiah.
\v 4 Tell them to give this message to their kings: This is what the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels says:
\v 5 'With my very great power \f + \ft metonymy, doublet \f* I created the earth and the people and the animals that are on the earth. And I can
give those things to anyone whom I want to. 
\v 6 And now I am going to enable King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, who does what I want him to do, to control your countries. I
am going to enable him to rule everything, even the wild animals.
\v 7  \add The people of\add* all the nations will work for him, and later for his son, and later for his grandson, until the
time for them \add to rule\add* is finished. Then \add the armies
of\add* many great kings from many nations will conquer Babylon.'
\p
\v 8 But now I tell you that you must \add do what the king of Babylon wants you to
do\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add like an ox that has\add* a yoke on its neck \add must do what its master wants it to
do\add*. I will punish any nation that refuses to do that. I will cause those people to experience war and famine and diseases,
until \add the armies of\add* Babylon have conquered that nation.
\v 9 So, do not pay attention to your \add false\add* prophets and fortune-tellers and people who predict what will happen by
working magic or by talking with spirits of dead people. Those people say that the king of Babylon will not conquer your
country. 
\v 10 Those people are all liars. \add If you believe what they say\add*, it will result in your being exiled from your land. I
will cause you to be taken from your land, and you will die far away.
\v 11 But the people of any country who do what the king of Babylon wants them to do will remain in their own country and be
able to plant their crops \f + \ft metonymy \f* as they always have done. \add That will surely happen
because\add* I, Yahweh, have said it." 
\b
\p
\v 12  \add After I gave that message to those ambassadors\add*, I gave the same message to King Zedekiah of Judah. I said to
him, "If you want to remain alive, do what the king of Babylon and his officials want you to do \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\v 13  \add It would be foolish for you not to do that, because the result would be
that\add* you and your people would die by your enemies' swords or by famine or diseases, which Yahweh will cause any nation to
experience that refuses to allow the king of Babylon to rule them.
\v 14 Do not pay attention to those prophets who say to you, 'The king of Babylon will not conquer your country.' They are
liars. 
\v 15 This is what Yahweh says: 'I have not appointed those prophets. They are saying that I \f + \ft metonymy \f* gave them messages, but they
are lying. So, \add if you believe them\add*, I will expel you from this land. And you and all those prophets will die
\add in Babylon\add*!' " 
\p
\v 16 Then I spoke to the priests and the other people, and I said, "This is what Yahweh says: 'Do not believe your prophets
who tell you that all the gold items \add that were taken\add* from my temple
\add by soldiers from Babylon\add* will soon be returned from Babylon, because what they are prophesying is a lie.
\v 17 Do not pay attention to what they say. Surrender to the king of Babylon. If you do that, you will remain alive.
\add If you do not do that\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*, this entire city will be destroyed.
\v 18 If they are really prophets who speak messages from me, tell them to plead to me, the Almighty Commander of the armies of
angels, that \add the soldiers from Babylon\add* will not be allowed to take away to Babylon the valuable items that still
remain in the temple and in the king's palace and in \add the other palaces
in\add* Jerusalem. 
\v 19  \add I say this\add* because the huge pillars that are in front of the temple and the large water tank and the ten water
carts and all the other items that are used \add for offering sacrifices are still in this
city\add*. 
\v 20 King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon left those things here when he exiled Jehoiachin, the king of Judah, to Babylon, along
with all the other leaders of Jerusalem and the leaders of other places in Judah.
\v 21 I, the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels, say this about all those valuable things that are still outside the
temple and in the palace of the king of Judah: 
\v 22 They will all be carried away to Babylon. And they will stay there until I say that they should be brought back to
Jerusalem. Then they will be bought back here. That is what I, Yahweh, say.' "
