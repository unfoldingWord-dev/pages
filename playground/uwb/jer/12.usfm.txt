\c 12  
\s Jeremiah complained to Yahweh 
\q
\v 1 Yahweh, whenever I tell you that I am unhappy \add about what is happening to
me\add*, 
\q2 you always act justly/fairly. 
\q So now allow me to ask about one more thing \add that I do not
understand\add*: 
\q2 why are wicked people \add often\add* very prosperous? 
\q2 Why do things go very well for dishonest/unfaithful people? 
\q
\v 2 You allow them to prosper 
\q2 like \f + \fr metaphor \f* trees that grow tall and bear a lot of fruit. 
\q They always say \f + \fr metonymy \f* good things about you, 
\q2 but in their inner beings, they are really far from you. 
\q
\v 3 But Yahweh, as for me, you know what is in my inner being. 
\q2 You see what I \add do\add* and you are able to know what I am thinking.
\q So drag away those wicked people, 
\q2 like \add people drag away\add* sheep that they are going to butcher.
\q Set them aside like sheep that are about to be slaughtered! 
\q
\v 4 This land is \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* becoming very dry and even the grass is withering.
\q The wild animals and the birds have all died 
\q2 because the people are very wicked. 
\q All this has happened because the people have said, 
\q2 “Yahweh does not know what we are doing (OR, what will happen to us)!”
\s Yahweh replied to Jeremiah 
\p
\v 5  \add Then to show me that I needed to be prepared to endure even greater difficulties, Yahweh said to
me\add*, 
\q \add “It is as though\add* you have become exhausted from racing against men;
\q2 so how will you be able to race against horses? 
\q If you stumble and fall when you are running on open/bare/smooth ground,
\q2 when will happen to you when you are running through the thornbushes near the Jordan
\add River\add*? 
\q
\v 6  \add Already\add* your brothers and \add other members of\add* your own family oppose you.
\q2 They ◄plot against/plan to do evil things to► you and they say bad things about you.
\q2 So even if they say nice things about you, 
\q do not trust them! 
\b
\q
\v 7 I have abandoned my Israeli people, 
\q2 the people whom I chose to belong to me. 
\q I have allowed their enemies to conquer the people whom I love.
\q
\v 8 My people have become to me like \f + \fr simile \f* a lion in the forest.
\q2 \add It is as though\add* they roar at me like a lion, 
\q2 so now I hate them. 
\q
\v 9 My chosen people have \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* become like speckled hawks 
\q2 that are surrounded by vultures \add waiting to eat their flesh after they are
dead\add*. 
\q Tell all the wild animals to come 
\q2 and eat the flesh of their corpses. 
\q
\v 10 Many rulers from other countries have come \add with their
armies\add* and devastated/destroyed my people 
\q2 \add whom I care for like a farmer takes care of\add* his vineyard.
\q They have caused my beautiful land to become a barren desert where no one lives.
\q
\v 11 They have caused it to become completely empty; 
\q2 \add it is as though\add* I hear the land crying sadly/mournfully.
\q The whole land is desolate, 
\q2 and no one ◄worries about/pays any attention to► it. 
\q
\v 12 The soldiers of our enemies have marched across all the barren hilltops.
\q But I, Yahweh, am using those armies \f + \fr metonymy \f* to punish your land from one end to the other,
\q2 and no one will escape. 
\q
\v 13  \add It is as though\add* my people planted wheat, 
\q2 but now they are harvesting thorns. 
\q They have become very tired \add because of much hard work\add*,
\q2 but they have gained nothing \add from all that work\add*. 
\q They will be very disappointed because their harvests \add will be very
small\add*, 
\q2 \add and that will happen\add* because I, Yahweh, am extremely angry with them.”
\b
\p
\v 14 This is also what Yahweh said to me: “I will punish the evil nearby nations that have been trying to take away the land
that I gave to my Israeli people, and I will force them to leave their own land. But I will throw the people of Judah out of
their land, also. 
\v 15 But later I will act mercifully toward those nations again, and I will bring them back to their own lands again. Each
\add clan\add* will come back to its own land. 
\v 16 And if the people of the other nations \add whose armies have invaded
Israel\add* learn the religious customs of my people, and if they learn that I
\add am listening\add* when they solemnly promise that they will do something, like they taught my people to believe that
\add their god\add* Baal \add was listening\add* when they made solemn promises, I will cause them to become prosperous, and
they also will be my people. 
\v 17 But I will expel any nation whose people refuse to obey me, and I will destroy that nation and its people.
\add That will surely happen because\add* I, Yahweh, have said it.”
