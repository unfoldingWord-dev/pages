\c 19  
\s Judah will be like a smashed jar 
\p
\v 1 This is another message that Yahweh gave to me: "Go and buy a clay jar from a man who makes them. Then take with you some
of the elders of the people and leaders of the priests. 
\v 2 Go out \add of the city\add* past the Gate of Broken Pots, to the place
\add overlooking the dump for broken pottery in\add* the Hinnom Valley. Then give them a message.
\v 3 Say to them, '\add This message is for\add* you kings of Judah and other people of Jerusalem. Listen to what Yahweh is
saying! The Almighty Commander of the armies of angels says that he will bring a terrible disaster on
\add Jerusalem\add*. Those who hear about it will be stunned\f + \ft Or: shocked \f* [IDI].
\v 4  \add That will happen\add* because you Israeli people have stopped worshiping me, and have caused this place to be a
place where \add you worship\add* foreign gods. You burn sacrifices to gods that neither you nor your ancestors nor even the
kings of Judah ever heard about. And you have filled this place with the blood of innocent people
\add whom you have killed\add*. 
\v 5 You have built shrines to honor your god Baal, and at those shrines you have
\add killed\add* your own children and offered them to be sacrifices to Baal. I never commanded you to do that, I never spoke
about doing that, I never even thought about anyone doing that. 
\v 6 So, beware, because I, Yahweh, say that there will be a time when this garbage dump will no longer be called Topheth or
Hinnom Valley; it will be called Slaughter Valley. 
\p
\v 7 In this place I will ruin the plans of you people who live in Jerusalem and in other places in Judah. I will allow your
enemies who want to kill you to kill many of you with their swords. Then I will allow your corpses to remain on the ground to
be food for vultures and wild animals. 
\v 8 I will \add completely destroy\add* Jerusalem and cause it to become a heap of ruins that people will despise. All the
people who pass by will be appalled, and they will be shocked when they see that the city has been destroyed.
\v 9 I will enable your enemies who want to kill you to surround the city for a long time.
\add Then the food will be all gone, and you people wlll be extremely hungry, with the result
that\add* you people in the city will eat the flesh of your own children and your neighbors' children.'
\p
\v 10  \add Jeremiah, after you tell that to them\add*, while the people who are with you are watching, smash the jar
\add that you brought\add*. 
\v 11 Then say to them, 'This is what the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels says: Just like this jar has been smashed
and cannot be repaired, I will smash this city of Jerusalem and other places in Judah. You will bury some of your corpses here
in this dump, until there is no more space to bury any more corpses.
\v 12 That is what I will do to this city and to you people who live here. I will cause this city to be desecrated, like
\add King Josiah caused Topheth to be\add* a place that was unfit for people to worship me there.
\v 13 The houses in Jerusalem and the palaces of the kings of Judah will be desecrated like this place will be. All the houses
where you burned incense on the rooftops to honor the stars \add that you
worshiped\add*, and where you poured out wine \add to be an offering\add* to your gods, will become desecrated\f + \ft Or: unacceptable
places for people to worship me \f*.' " 
\p
\v 14 Then I returned from the garbage dump where Yahweh had sent me to tell them that message. Then I stood in the courtyard
of Yahweh's temple and said this to all the people \add who were
there\add*: 
\v 15 "This is what the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels says: 'I will bring a disaster to this city and to the
villages around it like I promised, because you people have stubbornly [IDI] refused to pay attention to what I said to you.' "
