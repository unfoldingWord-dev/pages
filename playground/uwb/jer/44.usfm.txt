\c 44  
\s Jeremiah predicted disaster would come because of their idolatry
\p
\v 1 This is the message that Yahweh gave me concerning the Jews who were living in
\add northern\add* Egypt—in Migdol, Tahpenes, and Memphis \add cities\add*, and in the Pathros
\add region in southern Egypt\add*: 
\v 2 "This is what I, the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels, the God whom you Israelis
\add say you belong to\add*, say: You saw the disaster that I caused the people in Jerusalem and the other towns in Judah to
experience. Those towns are now ruined and deserted. 
\v 3 That happened because I was extremely angry with them on account of their being very wicked. They burned incense to other
gods and worshiped them. They were gods that you previously did not know about, and your ancestors also did not know about
them. 
\v 4 Many times I sent my prophets who served me, to say to them, 'Do not do those abominable things that I hate!'
\v 5 But my people would not pay any attention \f + \ft doublet \f* to what I said to them. They would not turn away from their wicked
behavior, or stop burning incense to \add worship\f + \ft Or: honor \f*\add* other gods.
\v 6 So I poured out my punishment \f + \ft metonymy \f* on them. My punishment fell on the streets of Jerusalem and on the other towns in
Judah. It caused those towns to be ruined and deserted, and they are still like that.
\p
\v 7 So now I, the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels, the God whom you Israelis
\add say you belong to\add*, ask you: Why are you causing yourselves to experience these disasters?
\add Do you not realize that because of what you are doing\add*, soon there will be no more men or women or children or infants
left among you \add who have come here to Egypt\add* from Judah?
\v 8 Why are you \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* provoking me and causing me to be very angry by burning incense to the idols that you have made here in
Egypt? \add If you continue doing this\add*, you will destroy yourselves, and you will cause yourselves to be people whom all
the nations on the earth will curse and despise. 
\v 9 Have you forgotten \add how I punished\add* your ancestors for the wicked things that they did, and
\add how I punished\add* the kings and queens of Judah for what they did, and you and your wives for the sins that you
committed in the streets of Jerusalem and the other towns in Judah?
\v 10 Up until this day you have not humbled yourselves or revered me. You have not obeyed the laws and decrees \f + \ft doublet \f* that I
gave to you and your ancestors. 
\p
\v 11 Therefore, this is what I, the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels, the God whom you Israelis
\add say you belong to\add*, say: I am determined to cause all of you to experience disasters and to get rid of everyone in
Judah. 
\v 12 You people from Judah who have survived were determined to come and live here in Egypt. So I will get rid of all of you
here in Egypt. Every one of you will die, including those who are important and those who are not important. Some of you will
be killed by your enemies' swords, some will die from famines. You will become people whom others curse, be horrified about,
and make fun of. 
\v 13 I will punish you here in Egypt like I punished others in Jerusalem, some of whom were killed by their enemies' swords
and some of whom died from famines or diseases. 
\v 14 You people who did not die in Judah fled here to Egypt, hoping that some day you would return to Judah. But very few
\f + \ft hyperbole \f* of you will survive and escape. You are longing\f + \ft Or: wanting \f* to remain alive and return to Judah, but only a very few of you
will escape and be able to do that." 
\p
\v 15 Then a large group of the people who had started to live in northern Egypt and southern Egypt, including all the men who
knew that their wives had been burning incense to other gods, and all the women who were standing there, said this to me:
\v 16 "You are saying that \f + \ft metonymy \f* Yahweh gave messages to you, but we will not pay any attention to your messages!
\v 17 We will certainly do everything that we said that we would do. We will burn incense to
\add worship our goddess Astarte\add*, the Queen of Heaven, and we will pour out offerings
\add of wine\add* to her, just like we and our ancestors and our kings and their officials have always done in the streets of
Jerusalem and in the other towns in Judah. At that time, we had plenty of food, and we were prosperous and we did not have any
troubles. 
\v 18 But ever since we stopped burning incense to the Queen of Heaven and giving her offerings
\add of wine\add*, we have had many troubles, and \add some of our
people\add* have been killed by our enemies' swords and some have died from hunger."
\p
\v 19 And \add the women said\add*, "Furthermore, we burned incense and poured out
\add wine\add* offerings to the Queen of Heaven, and we also made small cakes that resembled her idol, to offer to her. But our
husbands certainly knew about \add and approved of\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* what we were doing!"
\p
\v 20 Then I said to all the men and women who had answered me, 
\v 21 "Do not think \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* that Yahweh did not know that you and your ancestors and your kings and their officials and all the
other people in Judah were burning incense to \add worship\f + \ft Or: honor \f*\add* idols in the streets of Jerusalem and in the other towns
in Judah! 
\v 22 It was because Yahweh could no longer endure\f + \ft Or: tolerate \f* your wicked actions and the detestable things that you were doing
that he caused your land to be \add a place whose name people say when
they\add* curse someone, a land that is ruined and which has no one living in it. And your land is still like that.
\v 23 It is because you burned incense to \add worship\f + \ft Or: honor \f*\add* idols and committed other sins against Yahweh that you
experienced all those disasters. It is because you have not obeyed him or obeyed his laws and decrees and commandments."
\p
\v 24 Then I said to all of them, including the women, "All you people of Judah who are here in Egypt, listen to this message
from Yahweh. 
\v 25 This is what the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels, the God whom we Israelis
\add worship\add*, says \add to you Israeli men\add*: 'You and your wives have said that you would continue to do what you
promised, to burn incense and pour out wine to the \add goddess whom you
call\add* the Queen of Heaven. And you have proved by your actions that you intend to continue to do that. So go ahead and
continue doing what you have promised to do for her.' 
\p
\v 26 But now, all you people from Judah who are now living here in Egypt, listen to this message from Yahweh. He says, 'I have
solemnly declared, using my great name, that soon none of you people from Judah who are here in Egypt will ever again use my
name. \add There will be none of you who, when you solemnly promise to do
something\add*, will ever again say, "\add I will do it as surely\add* as Yahweh lives."
\v 27 Because I will be watching over you, not to cause good things to happen to you but to cause things to happen that will
harm you. Almost everyone \f + \ft hyperbole \f* from Judah who is now here in Egypt will experience being
\add killed by their enemies'\add* swords or dying from famine. 
\v 28 Only a very few of you will not die, and will return to Judah. When that happens, all those who came to Egypt will find
out whose words were true\f + \ft Or: were fulfilled \f*, theirs or mine.' 
\p
\v 29 And Yahweh also says, 'I will do something that will prove to you that everything that I have said will happen, and that
I will punish you here in this place. 
\v 30 I will cause Hophra, the king of Egypt, to be captured by his enemies who want to kill him, just like I caused King
Zedekiah of Judah to be captured by \add the soldiers of\add* King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon.' "
\add And that is what happened several years later\add*.
