\s A message about Philistia 
\p
\v 1 Yahweh gave to the prophet Jeremiah a message about the people of Philistia. The message was given to him before Gaza
\add city in Philistia\add* was captured by the army of Egypt. 
\p
\v 2 This is what Yahweh said: 
\q “\add An army\add* \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* will be coming from the northeast 
\q2 that will cover the land like a flood. 
\q They will destroy the land and everything in it; 
\q2 they will destroy people and cities. 
\q People will scream; 
\q2 everyone in the land will wail. 
\q
\v 3  \add They will hear\add* the sound of the hooves of the enemy horses,
\q2 and \add they will hear\add* the rumble\f + \ft Or: noise \f* of the wheels \add of their enemies'
chariots\add*. 
\q Men will run away; 
\q2 they will not stop to help their children; 
\q2 they will be completely weak and helpless \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f*. 
\q
\v 4 It will be the time for all the people of Philistia to be destroyed,
\q2 and the time to prevent the remaining soldiers from helping the people of Tyre and Sidon
\add cities\add*. 
\q I, Yahweh, will get rid of the people of Philistia, 
\q2 those whose ancestors \add long ago\add* came from Crete \add island\add*.
\q
\v 5 The people of Gaza will be humiliated; 
\q2 they will shave off all the hair on their heads \add to indicate that they are
ashamed\add*. 
\q The people of Ashkelon \add city\add* will all be silent \add because they will be
mourning\add*. 
\q \add All you people who live\add* along the coast of the \add Mediterranean
Sea\add* who are still alive, 
\q2 how long \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* will you gash yourselves \add because you are
mourning\add*?” 
\b
\q
\v 6  \add The people of Philistia say\add*, “Yahweh, when \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* will you
\add tell our enemies to stop killing us with\add* \\f + \\ft personification \\f* their swords?
\q2 Tell them to \\f + \\ft personification \\f* put them back into their sheaths and allow them to stay there!”
\q
\v 7 But it would not be right \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* for their swords to stay there,
\q2 because Yahweh has commanded their enemies \add to do something
more\add*; 
\q Yahweh intends to tell them to attack \add all the people living
in\add* Ashkelon and in other cities along the coast.
