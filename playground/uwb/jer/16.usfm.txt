\c 16  
\s Jeremiah was warned about the coming disaster 
\p
\v 1 Yahweh gave me another message. He said to me, 
\v 2 “Do not get married and have children in this land, 
\v 3 because this is what I, Yahweh, say about the children who are born in this city, and about their mothers and fathers:
\v 4 Many of them will die from terrible diseases. And no one will mourn for them. No one will even bury their corpses; the
corpses will lie on the ground, scattered like manure. Others will die in wars or from hunger, and then their corpses will
become food for vultures and wild animals.” 
\p
\v 5 This is also what Yahweh said to me: “Do not go to funerals to mourn or to show
\add those whose relatives have died\add* that you feel sorry for them, because I have stopped protecting them, and I have
caused that things will not go well for them. I have stopped faithfully loving them and acting mercifully toward them.
\v 6  \add Very many people\add* will die in this land, including those who are important and those who are not important. And
no one will mourn for them, or even bury \add their corpses\add*. No one will cut himself or shave his head
\add to show that he is very sad\add*. 
\v 7 No one will bring food to comfort those who are mourning, not even if it is their father or their mother
\add who has died\add*. No one will give them a cup \add of wine\add* to cheer them up.
\p
\v 8 And do not go to into the houses where people are feasting. Do not eat or drink anything with them.
\v 9  \add I want you to do this\add* because this is what I, the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels, say: ‘While you
are still alive and seeing it happen, I will cause there to be no more singing and laughing in this land. There will be no more
joyful voices of bridegrooms and brides.’ 
\p
\v 10 When you tell these things to the people, they will ask, ‘Why has Yahweh declared that these terrible things will happen
to us? What have we done \add for which we deserve to be punished like
this\add*? What sin have we committed against Yahweh our God?’ 
\p
\v 11 Then this is what you must tell them that I am replying to them: ‘It is because your ancestors turned away from me,
Yahweh. They worshiped other gods and served them. They abandoned me and did not obey my commands.
\v 12 But you \add who are living now\add* have done more wicked things than your ancestors did! Each of you stubbornly does
the evil things that he desires and refuses to pay attention to what I say.
\v 13 So, I will throw you out of this land, and I will send you to a land that you and your ancestors have never known about.
There you will worship other gods day and night. And I will not act mercifully toward you.’
\p
\v 14 But there will be a time when people \add who are solemnly promising to do
something\add* will no longer say, ‘\add I will do this\add*, \add just as
surely\add* as Yahweh lives - the one who brought the Israeli people here from Egypt.’
\v 15 Instead, they will say ‘\add I will do this\add*, \add just as
surely\add* as Yahweh lives - the one who brought us Israeli people back to our own land, from the lands to the north and from
all the other lands to which he had exiled\f + \ft Or: forced us to go \f*.’ \add They will be able to say
that\add* because \add some day\add* I will bring your descendants back to this land that I gave to your ancestors.
\p
\v 16 But now I am summoning \add your enemies who will seize them
like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* fishermen catch fish. I am summoning those who will search for them on every mountain and hill, and in every
cave, like \f + \ft metaphor \f* hunters \add search for animals to kill\add*. 
\v 17 I am watching them carefully. I see every sin \add that they
commit\add*. They will not be able to hide from me \f + \ft metonymy \f*. 
\v 18 Because of all the wicked things that they have done \f + \ft doublet \f*, I will punish them twice as much
\add as I would punish other people\add*. I will do that because they have caused my land to become unacceptable to me because
of their worshiping lifeless statues of detestable gods, and also because they have filled my land with the other evil things
that they have done.” 
\s Jeremiah prayed again, and Yahweh replied 
\q
\v 19  \add Then I prayed, saying\add*, “Yahweh, you are the one who strengthens me and protects me \f + \ft metaphor \f*;
\q2 you are the one to whom I go when I have \add troubles\add*.
\q \add Some day people from\add* nations all over the world will come to you and say,
\q2 ‘Our ancestors left\f + \ft Or: gave \f* us only something that was false; 
\q they worshiped idols that are completely worthless \f + \ft doublet \f*. 
\q
\v 20 No one can \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* make their own gods; 
\q2 the gods that they make are \add only idols\add*; they are not real gods.’ ”
\b
\q
\v 21  \add Then Yahweh said\add*, “Now I will show my power to \add the people of
Judah\add*; 
\q2 I will show them that I am truly very powerful \f + \ft doublet \f*. 
\q2 Then, finally, they will know that I, Yahweh, \add am the true
God\add*.”
