\c 43  
\s Jeremiah was taken to Egypt 
\p
\v 1 So I finished telling to the people that message from Yahweh our God.
\v 2 But then Johanan and Azariah and some other insolent\f + \ft Or: arrogant \f* men said to me, "You are lying! Yahweh our God has not told
us that we should not go to Egypt! 
\v 3  \add We think that\add* Baruch has urged\f + \ft Or: persuaded \f* you to say this, in order that
\add if we stay here, the soldiers from Babylonia\add* will seize us and kill us or take us to Babylonia."
\p
\v 4 So Johanan and the other leaders of the Israeli soldiers and many \f + \ft hyperbole \f* of the other people who were there refused to obey
Yahweh's command to stay in Judah. 
\v 5 Johanan and all the other leaders gathered together all the people who had returned from the other countries to which they
had been scattered. 
\v 6 They included men, women, children, the king's daughters, and all those whom Nebuzaradan had left with Gedaliah, and they
also took Baruch and me. 
\v 7 They refused to obey Yahweh, and they took us all \add to Egypt\add*, as far as Tahpenes
\add city\add*. 
\p
\v 8 While we were at Tahpenes, Yahweh gave me another message. He said,
\v 9 "While the people of Judah are watching you, take some large rocks and bury them under the brick pavement at the entrance
to the king's palace there at Tahpenes. 
\v 10 Then say to the people of Judah, 'This is what the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels, the God whom you Israelis
\add say you belong to\add*, says: "I will summon Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, who does my work, to come
\add with his army\add* to Egypt. I will set up his throne over these stones that I told Jeremiah to bury. And Nebuchadnezzar
will set up his tent there \add to show that he has become\add* the king
\add of Egypt\add*. 
\v 11 When his army comes, they will attack Egypt. Then those will die who
\add I have determined\add* must die, those who \add I have determined\add* must be captured will be captured, and those who I
have determined must be killed by swords will be killed by swords.
\v 12-13 Nebuchadnezzar's soldiers will burn down the temples of the gods of Egypt. But before they burn the temples, they will
take away their idols \add as souvenirs\add*. His troops will clean Egypt like a shepherd cleans lice from his cloak. They will
tear down the sacred pillars that are in the temple of their sun god. And then Nebuchadnezzar's troops will leave there,
without having been harmed." ' "
