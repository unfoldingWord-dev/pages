\c 18  
\s The potter and the clay 
\p
\v 1 Yahweh gave another message to me. He said, 
\v 2 "Go to the shop of the man who makes clay pots. I will give you a message there."
\v 3 So I went to that shop, and I saw the man who makes pots. He was working at the wheel
\add that he uses to form pots\add*. 
\v 4 But when he finished making one jar, it was not as good as he hoped\f + \ft Or: wanted \f* it to be. So, he took the clay and formed it
into another jar, shaping it as he desired to. 
\p
\v 5 Then Yahweh gave me this message: 
\v 6 "Perhaps the people of Israel \add think that\add* I cannot do to them like this man who makes pots has done \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*.
\add But what they think is wrong\add*. I \add can control what happens to them
like\add* this man \add controls what he does with the clay\add* in his hands.
\v 7 There may be a time when I proclaim that I will get rid of a nation or kingdom,
\add like someone\add* pulls up \add a plant with its roots\add*, and smash it, and destroy it.
\v 8 But if the people of that nation repent of doing evil things, I will not send to them the disasters that I planned to
send. 
\v 9 And there may be a time when I proclaim that I will establish a nation or kingdom and cause it to be strong \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\v 10 But if the people of that nation start to do evil things and refuse to obey me, then I will not bless them as I said that
I would do. 
\p
\v 11 Therefore, Jeremiah, go and warn all the people in Jerusalem and in other places in Judah. Say to them, 'This is what
Yahweh says: I am planning a disaster that I will send to you \f + \ft doublet \f*. So, each of you should turn from your evil behavior and
start doing what is right, \add in order that the disaster will not happen to
you\add*.' " 
\p
\v 12  \add So I told that message to the people\add*, but they replied, "It is useless
\add for you to tell us that\add*. We will continue to be stubborn and behave as we want to."
\p
\v 13 So, this is what Yahweh said: 
\q "Ask the \add people who live in other\add* nations if they have \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* ever heard of such a thing.
\q2 My Israeli people, who \add have been pure like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* virgins, have done a terrible thing!
\q
\v 14 The snow certainly never \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* completely disappears\f + \ft Or: melts \f* from the rocky slopes of the mountains in Lebanon.
\q2 The cold streams that flow down from those distant mountains never \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* cease flowing.
\q
\v 15 But my people are not \add as reliable as those streams\add*:
\q2 They have abandoned me. 
\q They burn incense to \add honor\f + \ft Or: worship \f*\add* worthless idols.
\q \add It is as though\add* they have stumbled as they walked along very old roads that are good roads,
\q2 and now, instead, they are walking on dirt paths. 
\q
\v 16 Therefore, their land will become desolate, 
\q2 and people who see it will hiss \add to ridicule it\add*. 
\q All the people who pass by will be appalled; 
\q2 they will shake their heads \add to show that they are shocked\add*.
\q
\v 17 I will scatter the people when their enemies \add attack them\add*
\q2 like dust is scattered by an east wind. 
\q And when they experience all these difficulties\f + \ft Or: disasters \f*, 
\q2 I will turn my back on them \add and refuse\add* to help them."
\s Jeremiah complained to Yahweh again when the people planned to attack him
\p
\v 18 Then the people said, "Come, let's plan to attack Jeremiah. We have many priests who teach us God's laws, and wise men
who give us good advice, and prophets who tell us \add what will happen. We do not need
Jeremiah\add*! So, let's slander him and not pay attention to anything that he says."
\p
\v 19  \add Then I prayed\add*, "Yahweh, please listen to me! 
\q2 And listen to what my enemies are saying about me. 
\q
\v 20 I am doing things that are good, 
\q2 so it is disgusting that \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* they are paying me back by doing evil
\add things to me\add*. 
\q \add It is as though\add* they have dug a pit for me \add to fall
into\add* and die. 
\q2 Do not forget that one time I stood in front of you and pleaded for you
\add to help them\add*, 
\q2 and I tried to prevent you from \add punishing them\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*, even though you were very angry with them.
\q
\v 21 So now, allow their children to die from hunger! 
\q2 Or cause them to be killed by \add their enemies'\add* swords!
\q Cause their wives to become widows, whose children are all dead!
\q2 Cause their old men to die in a plague, 
\q2 and cause their young men to be killed in battles! 
\q
\v 22 Cause people to scream in their homes 
\q2 when enemy soldiers suddenly come into their houses! 
\q \add Cause all these things to happen to them\add* because they
\add want to kill me\add*. 
\q It is as though they have dug a pit for me \add to fall into\add*,
\q2 and they have hidden traps along my path. 
\q
\v 23 Yahweh, you know all the things that they are planning to do to kill me.
\q Do not forgive them for their crimes 
\q2 or blot out \add the record of\add* their sins. 
\q Cause them to be destroyed; 
\q2 punish them because of your being angry with them!"
