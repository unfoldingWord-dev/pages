\c 24  
\s Good figs and bad figs 
\p
\v 1  \add The army of\add* King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon captured Jehoiachin, the king of Judah, and his officials, and all
his skilled workers \f + \ft doublet \f* and took them to Babylon. After that happened, Yahweh gave me a vision.
\add In the vision\add* I saw two baskets of figs that had been placed in front of the temple.
\v 2 One basket was full of good figs, like the kind that ripen first. The other basket was filled with figs that were
bad\f + \ft Or: rotten \f*, with the result that they could not be eaten. 
\p
\v 3 Then Yahweh said to me, "Jeremiah, what do you see?" 
\p I replied, "I see some figs. Some are very good ones, but some are very bad, with the result that no one would eat them."
\p
\v 4 Then Yahweh me gave me this message: 
\v 5 "This is what I, Yahweh, the God whom the Israeli people \add say that they
worship\add*, say: The good figs represent \f + \ft simile \f* the people of Judah whom I exiled to Babylonia.
\v 6 I \f + \ft synecdoche \f* will watch over\f + \ft Or: take care of \f* them well, and some day I will bring them back here
\add to Judah\add*. I will establish them and cause them to be strong. I will cause them to be prosperous \f + \ft metaphor \f*, and I will not
exile them again. 
\v 7 I will enable them to desire to know [IDI] in their inner beings that I am Yahweh. They will be my people, and I will be
their God, because they will return to me sincerely. 
\p
\v 8 But I, Yahweh, also say, the bad figs represent \f + \ft simile \f* Zedekiah, the king of Judah, and his officials, and all the other
people who remain in Jerusalem, and those who have gone to Egypt. I will do to them like people do to rotten figs.
\v 9 I will \add cause them to experience calamities\f + \ft Or: disasters \f*\add*, with the result that people in every nation on the earth
will be horrified, and will hate them because they are evil people. Wherever I scatter them, people will make fun of them, and
say that they are disgraced, and ridicule them, and curse them. 
\v 10 And I will cause them to experience wars and famines and diseases, until they have disappeared from Israel, this land
which I gave to them and to their ancestors."
