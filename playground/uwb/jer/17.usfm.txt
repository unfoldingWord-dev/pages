\c 17  
\s Yahweh's promise to punish Judah 
\q
\v 1  \add Yahweh said, “It is as though a list of\add* the sins
\add committed by the people of\add* Judah is engraved with an iron chisel, or engraved using the fine point of a very hard
stone, 
\q2 on the altars \add where they worship idols\add*. 
\q And \add it is as though\add* this list is engraved on their inner beings!
\q
\v 2 Even their children are happy to go to the altars \add for their
gods\add*, and to the poles \add that represent the goddess\add* Asherah
\add at which their parents worshiped\add*, 
\q2 shrines that are underneath all the big trees 
\q2 and on all the high hills. 
\q
\v 3 So, I will allow your enemies to capture \add Zion\add*, your holy hill,
\q2 and all your wealth and your ◄treasures/valuable things►, 
\q2 and even the shrines on all those hills, 
\q2 because of the sins that you people have committed throughout your land.
\q
\v 4 The wonderful land that I gave to you will no longer belong to you.
\q I will tell your enemies to take you to a land that you do not know about,
\q2 and you will become their slaves. 
\q \add I will do that\add* because I am extremely angry \add with
you\add*; 
\q2 my being angry is like a fire that will burn forever.” 
\p
\v 5 This is also what Yahweh says: 
\q “I will curse/condemn those who trust in human beings \add to help
them\add*, 
\q2 those who rely on their own strength 
\q2 and turn away from me with their inner beings. 
\q
\v 6 They are like dry bushes in the desert, 
\q2 they are people who will not experience any good things. 
\q Those people will live in the barren desert 
\q2 in a salty area, where nothing grows. 
\b
\q
\v 7 But I am pleased with those who trust in me, Yahweh, 
\q2 and who confidently expect \add me to take care of them\add*.
\q
\v 8 Those people are like \f + \fk simile \f* fruit trees that have been planted along a riverbank,
\q2 trees that have roots that go down into the \add wet ground beside\add* the water.
\q They are trees whose leaves remain green when it becomes hot,
\q2 trees that continue to bear fruit when there are many months in which there is no rain.
\b
\q
\v 9 Human minds are extremely corrupt/deceitful, 
\q2 and we cannot change that. 
\q2 It is also completely impossible \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* for anyone to understand that.
\b
\q
\v 10 But I, Yahweh, search what is in everyone's inner being, 
\q2 and I examine what they are thinking. 
\q I will give all people rewards, 
\q2 what they deserve for what they have done.” 
\b
\q
\v 11  \add I, Jeremiah, agree, because I know that\add* people who become rich by doing things that are unjust
\q2 are like birds that hatch eggs that they ◄did not lay/stole from another nest►.
\q So, when those people have lived only half of the years \add that they expect to
live\add*, their wealth will disappear. 
\q2 Then \add other people will realize that\add* those rich people have been foolish.
\b
\q
\v 12 Yahweh, your temple is like a glorious throne 
\q2 that has been on a high hill since it was built. 
\q
\v 13 You are the one whom we Israeli people confidently expect \add to bless
us\add*, 
\q2 and all those who turn away from you will be disgraced. 
\q Their names will be written \add only\add* in the dust, \add and will soon
disappear\add*, 
\q2 because they have abandoned you, who are like \f + \fk metaphor \f* a fountain where people obtain fresh water.
\b
\q
\v 14 Yahweh, \add please heal me, because\add* if you heal me, I will truly be healed.
\q2 If you rescue me, I will truly be safe, 
\q2 because you are the only one whom I praise. 
\q
\v 15 People often ridicule me and say, 
\q “You tell us messages that you say came from Yahweh, 
\q2 but ◄why have the things that you predicted not happened?/those predictions have not come true!►” \f + \fk rhetorical question \f*
\q
\v 16 Yahweh, you \add appointed me to take care of your people like\add* a shepherd
\add takes care of his sheep\add* \f + \fk metaphor \f*; I have not abandoned that work,
\q2 and you know that I have not \add previously\add* wanted this time of disaster
\add to come to people who ridicule me\add*. 
\q And you know everything that I have said \f + \fk metonymy \f* \add to your people\add*.
\q
\v 17 Do not cause me to be terrified! 
\q2 When disasters come/occur, you are the one to whom I will go to be safe.
\q
\v 18  \add So now\add*, cause those who ◄persecute me/cause me to suffer► to be ashamed and dismayed,
\q2 but do not \add do things to me that will\add* cause me to be ashamed and dismayed.
\q Cause them to be terrified! 
\q2 Do to them many things that will completely destroy them! 
\s Keeping the Sabbath day holy 
\p
\v 19 This is what Yahweh said to me: “Go to the city gates in Jerusalem. First go to the gate where the kings of Judah go in
and out of the city, and then go to each of the other gates. 
\v 20 Say to the people \add at each gate\add*, ‘You kings of Judah and everyone else who is living in Jerusalem and all you
other people of Judah who enter these gates, listen to this message from Yahweh!
\v 21 He says, “Listen to this warning carefully! Stop \add doing work on ◄Sabbath/our rest►
days\add*! Stop carrying loads through these gates on those days!
\v 22 Do not carry loads out of your houses or do any other work on Sabbath days! Instead, cause Sabbath days to be ◄holy/set
apart for me►. I commanded your ancestors to do that, 
\v 23 but they did not listen to me or obey me. When I did things to correct them, they stubbornly [IDI] refused to pay
attention to what I said or to accept it. 
\v 24 But I say that if you obey me, and if you do not carry loads through these gates
\add on Sabbath days\add* or do any other work on Sabbath days, and if you dedicate the Sabbath days to me,
\v 25 kings of Judah \f + \fk metonymy \f* and their officials will continue to go in and out of these gates. There will always be someone who
is a descendant of \f + \fk metonymy \f* \add King\add* David ruling here \f + \fk metonymy \f* in Jerusalem. Kings and their officials will go in and out of
these gates, riding in chariots and on horses, and there will be people living in this city forever.
\v 26 And people will come \add to Jerusalem\add* bringing offerings to be completely burned
\add on the altar\add* and other offerings. They will bring to the temple grain offerings and incense and offerings to thank
\add me\add*. People will bring these offerings from the towns in Judah and the villages near Jerusalem and from the land where
the tribe of Benjamin lives and from the western foothills and from the desert in the south.
\v 27 But if you do not pay attention to what I say, and if you refuse to dedicate the Sabbath days to me, and if you continue
to carry loads through these gates into the city on Sabbath days, I will burn these gates completely. The fire will spread to
the palaces, and no one will be able to put out that fire.” ’ ”
