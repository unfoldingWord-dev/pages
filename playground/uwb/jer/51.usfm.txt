\c 51  
\s Babylon will be destroyed 
\p
\v 1 This is what Yahweh says: 
\q "I will inspire\f + \ft Or: motivate \f* \add an army\add* to destroy Babylon
\add like a powerful\add* wind \f + \ft metaphor \f*, 
\q2 and also to destroy the people of Babylonia. 
\q
\v 2 I will send a foreign army to come to get rid of Babylonia 
\q2 like \add a strong wind\add* that blows away chaff. 
\q They will attack from every direction 
\q2 on that day of disaster. 
\q
\v 3  \add I will tell them\add*, 'Do not allow the archers \add of
Babylon\add* to \add have time to\add* put on their armor 
\q2 or draw their bows. 
\q Do not spare the young men of Babylon. 
\q2 Completely destroy their army.' 
\q
\v 4 Their soldiers will fall dead in Babylonia; 
\q2 they will die after being wounded in the streets. 
\q
\v 5 I, the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels, the Israelis' God, have not abandoned Israel and Judah.
\q2 Even though their land was filled with people who sinned against me, the Holy God of Israel,
\q2 I am still their God. 
\b
\q
\v 6  \add You people of Israel and Judah\add*, flee from Babylon!
\q2 Run to escape! 
\q Do not stay there and be killed when I punish \add the people of
Babylon\add*! 
\q It will be the time when I will get revenge; 
\q2 I will do to them what they deserve. 
\q
\v 7 Babylon has been like \f + \ft metaphor \f* a gold cup in my hand, a cup that is
\add full of wine\add* 
\q2 that caused people all over the earth who drank some of it to become drunk.
\q \add It is as though\add* the \add rulers of\add* the nations drank the wine from Babylon,
\q2 and it caused them to become crazy. 
\q
\v 8 But suddenly Babylon will be conquered. 
\q2 \add You foreigners who live in Babylon\add*, weep for its people.
\q Give them medicine for their wounds; 
\q2 perhaps they can be healed." 
\b
\q
\v 9 We \add foreigners\add* would have tried to heal them, 
\q2 but now they cannot be healed. 
\q So we will not try to help them; we will abandon them, 
\q2 and return to our own lands, 
\q because \add it is as though\add* the punishment they are receiving reaches up to the clouds in sky;
\q2 \add it is very great, with the result that no one can measure
it\add*. 
\b
\q
\v 10 Yahweh has vindicated us\f + \ft Or: shown that we were right \f*; 
\q2 so let's proclaim in Jerusalem everything that Yahweh our God has done
\add for us\add*. 
\b
\q
\v 11  \add You enemy soldiers\add*, sharpen your arrows! 
\q2 Lift up your shields, 
\q because Yahweh has incited your kings of Media \add and Persia to march with their
armies\add* to Babylon and to destroy it. 
\q2 That is how Yahweh will get revenge on \add those foreigners who
entered\add* his temple \add in Jerusalem\add* and defiled it. 
\q
\v 12 Lift up a battle flag close to the walls of Babylon! 
\q2 Reinforce the\f + \ft Or: Appoint more \f* guards, 
\q and tell the watchmen to stand in their positions! 
\q Prepare an ambush, 
\q2 because Yahweh is about to accomplish all that he has planned to do to the people of Babylon.
\q
\v 13 Babylon is a city near the great \add Euphrates\add* River,
\q2 a city in which there are many rich people, 
\q but it is time for Babylon to be finished; 
\q2 the time for the city to exist is ended. 
\q
\v 14 The Almighty Commander of the armies of angels has solemnly promised, using his own name,
\q "Your cities will be filled with your enemies; 
\q2 I will cause them to be like \f + \ft simile \f* a swarm of locusts; 
\q2 and they will shout triumphantly \add when they conquer your
city\add*." 
\s A song to praise Yahweh 
\q
\v 15 Yahweh created the earth by his power; 
\q2 he established it by his wisdom, 
\q2 and he stretched out the sky by his understanding. 
\q
\v 16 When he speaks loudly, there is thunder in the sky; 
\q2 he causes clouds to form in every part of the earth. 
\q He sends lightning with the rain 
\q2 and releases the winds from his storehouses. 
\b
\q
\v 17 People are senseless, and they know very little \f + \ft hyperbole \f*; 
\q those who make idols are always disappointed, 
\q2 because their idols do nothing for them. 
\q The images\f + \ft Or: statues \f* that they make are not real \add gods\add*;
\q2 they are lifeless. 
\q
\v 18 Idols are worthless; they deserve to be ridiculed; 
\q2 there will be a time when they will all be destroyed. 
\q
\v 19 But the God whom we Israelis \add worship\add* is not like those idols;
\q2 he is the one who created everything that exists; 
\q we, the tribe of Israel, belong to him; 
\q2 his name is 'the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels.'
\b
\q
\v 20 Yahweh says \add about the army of Babylonia\add* \f + \ft Or: about a nation that will attack Babylonia \f*,
\q "You are like \f + \ft metaphor \f* my battle-axe and war-club; 
\q with your \add power\add* I shatter nations 
\q2 and destroy many kingdoms. 
\q
\v 21 With your \add power\add* I shatter armies \add of other nations\add*:
\q2 I destroy their horses and their riders, their chariots and their chariot-drivers.
\q
\v 22 With your \add power\add* I shatter men and women, 
\q2 old people and children, 
\q2 young men and young women. 
\q
\v 23 With your \add power\add* I shatter shepherds and their flocks of sheep,
\q2 farmers and their oxen, 
\q2 governors and their officials." 
\b
\p
\v 24 But, Yahweh also says, 
\q "Soon I will repay\f + \ft Or: punish \f* you people in Babylon and in the rest of Babylonia
\q2 for all the evil things that you have done in Jerusalem. 
\q
\v 25 Babylonia is \f + \ft apostrophe \f* like \f + \ft metaphor \f* a great mountain 
\q2 \add from which bandits descend\add* to plunder\f + \ft Or: steal things from \f* people all over the earth.
\q But I, Yahweh, am the enemy of you \add people of Babylonia\add*.
\q2 I will raise my fist to strike you. 
\q I will knock you down from the cliffs 
\q2 and cause you to be only a huge pile of burned rubble. 
\q
\v 26 Your city will be abandoned forever; 
\q2 even the stones in your city will never again be used for buildings.
\q2 Your city will be completely destroyed." 
\b
\q
\v 27  \add Tell\add* the nations to lift up a battle flag! 
\q2 \add Tell them to\add* shout the battle-cry! 
\q Gather all their armies to fight against Babylon! 
\q2 Prepare the nations to attack Babylon. 
\q2 Summon the armies of the kingdoms \add north of Babylonia\add*—from Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz.
\q Appoint a commander for them, 
\q and bring a great number of horses; 
\q2 \add there must be a huge number of horses\add*; that huge number will resemble \f + \ft simile \f* a swarm of locusts.
\q
\v 28 Prepare the armies \add of other nations\add*, 
\q2 armies that will be led by the kings of Media \add and Persia\add*,
\q2 their governors and their officials. 
\q
\v 29  \add When they attack Babylon, it will be as though\add* the earth will shake and writhe
\add in pain\add*, 
\q2 because those armies will accomplish everything that Yahweh has planned to do to Babylon—
\q to destroy it completely, 
\q2 with the result that no one will live there again. 
\q
\v 30  \add When their enemies attack\add*, the strongest warriors in Babylon will not fight.
\q2 They will remain in their barracks, without any strength. 
\q They will be as timid\f + \ft Or: weak \f* as \f + \ft simile \f* women. 
\q2 \add The enemy soldiers\add* will burn the buildings in the city
\q and pull down the bars \add of the city gates\add*. 
\q
\v 31 Messengers will go quickly, one after another, 
\q2 to tell the king that his city has been captured. 
\q
\v 32 The places at which people can cross \add the river to escape from the
city\add* will be blocked. 
\q2 The dry reeds in the marshes\f + \ft Or: swamps \f* will be set on fire, 
\q2 and the soldiers of Babylon will be terrified. 
\b
\p
\v 33 This is what the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels, the God whom we Israelis
\add worship\add*, says; 
\q "Babylon is like \f + \ft simile \f* wheat on the ground where it is about to be threshed
\q2 by \add animals\add* tramping on it. 
\q2 Very soon their enemies will trample on the city of Babylon \f + \ft metaphor \f*."
\b
\q
\v 34  \add The army of\add* Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, has attacked and crushed us
\add Israelis\add*, 
\q2 and we have no strength left. 
\q \add It is as though\add* they have swallowed us like a great monster
\q2 that filled its belly with all our tasty parts, 
\q2 and then has spit out \add what it did not like\add*. 
\q
\v 35 So the people of \f + \ft personification \f* Jerusalem say \add to Yahweh\add*, 
\q "Cause the people of Babylon to suffer 
\q2 like they caused us to suffer! 
\q Cause the people of Babylonia to be punished for killing \f + \ft metonymy \f* our people!"
\s Yahweh will get revenge on Babylon 
\p
\v 36 And this is what Yahweh replies to the people of Jerusalem:
\q "I will \add be like your lawyer to\add* defend you, 
\q2 and I will avenge you. 
\q I will dry up the river in Babylon 
\q2 and all the springs of water. 
\q
\v 37 Babylon will become a heap of ruins, 
\q2 a place where jackals\f + \ft Or: wolves \f* live. 
\q It will become a place that people are horrified about and will ridicule;
\q2 it will be a place where no one lives. 
\q
\v 38 The people of Babylon will all roar like young lions; 
\q2 they will growl like baby lions. 
\q
\v 39 But while they are extremely hungry, 
\q2 I will prepare a different kind of feast for them. 
\q I will cause them to drink wine until they are very drunk, 
\q2 with the result that they will fall asleep. 
\q But they will never wake up from that sleep! 
\q
\v 40 I will bring them down to a place where they will be slaughtered,
\q2 like \f + \ft simile \f* someone who takes lambs or rams or goats to where they will be slaughtered
\add for sacrifices\add*. 
\b
\q
\v 41 People all over the earth now honor\f + \ft Or: boast about \f* Babylon;
\q2 they say that it is a great city. 
\q But I will cause it to become a \add place about which people of
all\add* nations are horrified. 
\q
\v 42 The \add enemies of Babylon\add* will cover the city like huge waves of the sea \f + \ft doublet \f*.
\q
\v 43 The towns in Babylonia will become ruins, 
\q2 and it will be a land in which no one lives 
\q2 and which no one walks through. 
\q
\v 44 And I will punish Bel, the god \add that the people\add* of Babylon
\add worship\add*, 
\q2 and I will cause the people to give back what they have stolen \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\q People of other nations will no longer come to worship Bel. 
\q2 And the walls of Babylon will collapse." 
\s A message for the Israeli people 
\q
\v 45  \add Yahweh also says\add*, "My people, come out of Babylon!
\q2 Flee to escape! 
\q2 Run, because I, Yahweh, am extremely angry \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add with the people of Babylon, and I will get rid of
them\add*! 
\q
\v 46 Do not be discouraged\f + \ft Or: worried \f* [IDI] or afraid 
\q2 when you hear reports \add about what is happening in Babylon\add*.
\q People will report rumors like that every year, 
\q2 rumors about violent things being done in the land, 
\q2 and rumors about leaders fighting against each other. 
\q
\v 47 But it will soon be the time for me to get rid of the idols in Babylon.
\q \add People all over\add* the land will be ashamed \add because of being
defeated\add*; 
\q2 and the corpses of their soldiers will lie in the streets. 
\q
\v 48 Then all the \add angels in\add* heaven and all the \add people
on\add* \f + \ft personification \f* the earth will rejoice, 
\q2 because from the east will come armies that will destroy Babylon.
\q
\v 49 Like \add the soldiers of Babylon\add* killed the people of Israel
\q2 and also killed others all over the world \f + \ft hyperbole \f*, 
\q2 the people of Babylon must also be killed. 
\q
\v 50 You Israeli people who have not been killed \f + \ft metonymy \f*, get out of Babylon!
\q2 Do not wait! 
\q \add Even though you are in a land\add* far away \add from Israel\add*,
\q2 think about Yahweh, and think about Jerusalem!" 
\q
\v 51  \add The Israeli people say\add*, 
\q2 "We are ashamed. 
\q We are completely disgraced \f + \ft doublet \f*, 
\q2 because foreigners have entered Yahweh's temple and defiled it\f + \ft Or: caused it to become unfit for worship \f*."
\b
\q
\v 52 Yahweh replies, "\add That is true\add*, but there will soon be a time when I will destroy the idols in Babylon,
\q2 and throughout Babylonia there will be wounded people who will groan.
\q
\v 53 Even if \add the walls around\add* Babylon could extend up to the sky,
\q2 and if its walls\f + \ft Or: fortifications \f* were extremely strong, 
\q I will send armies that will destroy the city. 
\q2 \add That will surely happen because\add* I, Yahweh, have said it."
\s Babylon will be completely destroyed 
\q
\v 54 Listen to the people of Babylon crying \add for help\add*!
\q2 And listen to the sounds of things being destroyed all over Babylonia!
\q
\v 55 Yahweh will be destroying Babylon. 
\q2 He will cause the loud noises in the city to cease. 
\q
\v 56 Enemy troops will surge against the city like \f + \ft simile \f* a great wave.
\q2 They will capture the city's mighty soldiers 
\q2 and break their weapons. 
\q That will happen because Yahweh is a God who punishes \add his
enemies\add* justly; 
\q2 he will punish them as they deserve. 
\p
\v 57 The Almighty Commander of the armies of angels says, 
\q "I will cause the city officials and wise men, the army captains and soldiers, to become drunk.
\q2 They will fall asleep, 
\q2 but they will never wake up again!" 
\p
\v 58 Yahweh also says, 
\q "The thick walls around Babylon will be flattened to the ground.
\q2 The city gates will be burned. 
\q People \add from other countries\add* will work hard \add to save the
city\add*, 
\q2 but it will be in vain\f + \ft Or: useless \f*, 
\q2 because everything \add that they have built\add* will be destroyed by fire."
\s Jeremiah's message was taken to Babylon 
\p
\v 59 Seraiah was the man who made arrangements for the king of Babylon
\add whenever he traveled\add*. He was the son of Neraiah and grandson of Mahseiah. When he was about to go to Babylon with
King Zedekiah, after Zedekiah had been ruling Judah for almost four years, the prophet Jeremiah gave him a message.
\v 60 Jeremiah had written on a scroll a list of all the disasters that he had written about, disasters that would soon happen
to Babylon. 
\v 61 Jeremiah said to Seraiah, "When you arrive in Babylon, read aloud everything that I have written
\add on this scroll\add*. 
\v 62 Then pray, 'Yahweh, you said that you will thoroughly destroy Babylon, with the result that people and animals will no
longer live there. You said that it will be desolate forever.' 
\v 63 Then, when you have finished reading what I have written on the scroll, tie it to a heavy stone and throw it into the
Euphrates \add River\add*. 
\v 64 Then say, 'In the same way, Babylon and its people will disappear and never exist again, because of the disasters that
Yahweh will bring to it.' " 
\b
\p This is the end of Jeremiah's messages.
