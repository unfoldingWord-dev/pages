\c 34  
\s Jeremiah warned King Zedekiah 
\p
\v 1 King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came with the armies of all the kingdoms that he ruled, and they fought against Jerusalem
and the other towns in Judah. At that time, Yahweh gave me this message:
\v 2 “Go to Zedekiah the King of Judah, and say to him, ‘This is what Yahweh, the God whom we Israelis
\add worship\add*, says: “I am about to enable the army of the king of Babylon to capture this city, and they will burn it
down. 
\v 3 You will not escape from them; they will capture you and take you to the king of Babylon. And then they will take you to
Babylon.” ’ 
\p
\v 4 But King Zedekiah, listen to this that Yahweh has promised: ‘You will not be killed in a battle \f + \ft metonymy \f*;
\v 5 you will die peacefully. \add When you die\add*, people will burn incense to honor\f + \ft Or: remember \f* you just as they did for your
ancestors who were kings before you became king. They will mourn for you, crying, “We are very sad that our king is dead!” I,
Yahweh, promise that will happen.’ ” 
\p
\v 6 So I took that message to King Zedekiah. 
\v 7 At that time the army of Babylonia had surrounded Jerusalem and Lachish and Azekah. Those three cities were the only three
cities in Judah that had high walls around them that still had not been captured.
\s Jeremiah warned them they would be punished for not freeing their slaves
\p
\v 8 King Zedekiah had decreed that the people must free their slaves.
\v 9 He decreed that the people must free their Hebrew slaves, both the men slaves and the women slaves. No one would be
allowed to force a fellow Jew to continue to be his slave. 
\v 10 The officials and the rest of the people had obeyed what the king decreed,
\v 11 but later they changed their minds. They forced the men and women whom they had freed to become their slaves again.
\p
\v 12 So Yahweh gave me this message to tell to them: 
\v 13 “I, Yahweh, the God whom you Israelis \add say you belong to\add*, made an agreement with\f + \ft Or: gave this command to \f* your
ancestors long ago, when I rescued them from being slaves in Egypt.
\v 14 I told them that they must free all their Hebrew slaves after the slaves had worked for them for six years. But your
ancestors did not pay any attention to what I said. 
\v 15 Recently, you obeyed my command and stopped doing what was wrong and did what was right. You made a solemn agreement at
my temple \add that you would free your slaves\add*, and then you freed them.
\v 16 But now you have disregarded what you solemnly promised, and you have shown contempt for what I \f + \ft metonymy \f* said by taking back
the women and men whom you had freed and said they could live wherever they wanted to. Now you have forced them to be your
slaves again. 
\p
\v 17 Therefore, this is what I, Yahweh, say: ‘Because you have not obeyed me by freeing your fellow Israelis, I will free you
to be destroyed by the swords \add of your enemies\add* and by famines and diseases. All the nations of the earth will be
horrified because of \add what happens to\add* you. 
\v 18-19 Because you have disregarded what I said in my agreement with you, I will do to you just like you did to the calves
that you cut in half to show that you would surely do what you solemnly promised that you would do. I will
\add enable your enemies to\add* cut you into pieces, you officials of Judah and you officials of Jerusalem, and you officials
in the palace, and you priests and all you common people. I will do that because you have disregarded what you solemnly
promised \add about freeing your slaves\add*. 
\v 20 I will enable your enemies to capture you, and they will kill you. And your bodies will be food for vultures and wild
animals. 
\p
\v 21 I will enable the army of the king of Babylon to capture King Zedekiah and his officials. Although the king of Babylon
and his army have left Jerusalem for a short time, 
\v 22 I will summon them back again. This time, they will fight against this city and capture it and burn it down. I will make
sure that all the towns in Judah are destroyed, with the result that no one will live there anymore.’ ”
