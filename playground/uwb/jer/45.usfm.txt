\c 45  
\s A message for Baruch 
\p
\v 1 After Jehoiakim the son of King Josiah had been ruling Judah for almost four years, I, Baruch wrote down all the messages
that the prophet Jeremiah had dictated to me. Then Jeremiah gave me a message. He said,
\v 2 “Baruch, Yahweh, the God whom we Israelis \add worship\add*, has a message for you.
\v 3 You have said, ‘Terrible things \add are happening\add* to me! I have endured much pain already. And now Yahweh is causing
me to be very sad, in addition to my having pain. I am exhausted from my groaning\f + \ft Or: being sad \f*, and I am unable to rest!’
\p
\v 4 But Baruch, this is what Yahweh says: ‘I will destroy this nation that I established.
\add This nation is like a tree\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* that I planted and that I will now pull up with its roots.
\v 5 So, should you \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* desire that people do things to honor you in a special way? Do not desire that.
\add It is true that\add* I will cause all these people to experience a great disaster, but wherever you go, I will protect
you, and you will not be killed.’ ”
