\c 18  
\s Luke 18:1-8 
\s Jesus taught about continuing to believe that God will answer prayer.
\p
\v 1  \add Jesus\add* told \add his disciples\add* a parable to teach them that they always ought to pray confidently and not
be discouraged \add if God does not immediately answer their prayers\add*.
\v 2 He said, “In a certain city there was a judge who did not revere God, and did not care about people, either.
\v 3 There was a widow in that city who kept coming to him, saying, ‘Please decide what is just
\add in the dispute between me and\add* the man who is opposing me
\add in court!’\add* 
\v 4 For a long time the judge refused \add to help her\add*. But later he said to himself, ‘I do not revere God and I do not
care about people, 
\v 5 but this widow keeps bothering me! So I will \add judge her case and
show\add* that she is right. \add If I do not do that\add*, she will exhaust me by continually coming to me!’”
\v 6 Then the Lord \add Jesus\add* said, “\add Even though\add* the judge was not a righteous man, think carefully about what
he said! 
\v 7  \add Similarly\add*, ◄God will certainly show that \add what
you\add* have done has been right!/will God not show that \add what
you\add* have done has been right?► [RHQ] He will do this for you whom he has chosen.
\add He will do this for you\add* who pray earnestly to him night and day, asking him to
\add help you\add*. He may delay \add helping you\add*. 
\v 8 But I tell you, \add some day\add* he will show that what you did was right, and he will do it quickly. But when
\add I\add*, the one who came from heaven, return to earth, ◄there may not be
\add many people who will still\add* be trusting \add that I will vindicate
them\add* (OR, who will still be trusting in me)./will there be \add many people who will
still\add* be trusting \add that I will vindicate them\add* (OR, who will still be trusting in me)?► [RHQ]”
\s Luke 18:9-14 
\s Jesus taught about not thinking that we are better than others in God's sight.
\p
\v 9  \add Jesus\add* also told a parable \add to warn\add* people who mistakenly thought that they were doing things that made
them acceptable to God. Besides, they also despised other people.
\v 10  \add He said this\add*: “Two men went up to the Temple \add in
Jerusalem\add* to pray. One was a Pharisee. The other was a tax collector.
\v 11 The Pharisee stood and prayed silently, ‘God, I thank you that I am not like other men.
\add Some\add* extort money \add from others\add*; some treat others unjustly; some commit adultery.
\add I do not do such things. And I am certainly not\add* like this tax collector
\add who cheats people!\add* 
\v 12  \add Our law says that we(exc) should\add* ◄fast/abstain from food►
\add once a week\add*, \add but I do more than that. I\add* fast twice a week! I give
\add you\add* ten percent of all that I earn!’ 
\v 13 But the tax collector stood far \add from the other people in the Temple courtyard because he felt very
unworthy\add*. He would not even look up toward heaven. Instead, he beat on his chest
\add to show that he was sorry for his sin\add*. He said, ‘God, I am a sinner; be merciful to me
\add and forgive me\add*!’” 
\v 14  \add Then Jesus said\add*, “I tell you\add (pl)\add* that as the tax collector went home, the record of his sins was
erased {\add God\add* erased the record of his sins}, not that of the Pharisee.
\add Remember this\add*: Those who exalt themselves will be humbled
{\add God\add* will humble all those who exalt themselves}, but those who humble themselves will be exalted
{\add he\add* will exalt those who humble themselves}.” 
\s Luke 18:15-17 
\s Jesus taught about accepting God's rule in our lives as easily as little children do.
\p
\v 15  \add One day when many people were coming to Jesus\add*, they were also bringing small children. They wanted him to put
his hands on \add the children and bless them\add*. When the disciples saw that, they rebuked
\add those who were bringing them\add*. 
\v 16 But Jesus called the children \add to come to him\add*. He said, “Let the children come to me! Do not stop them! It is
people who are\add humble and trusting\add* like they are who can experience God ruling
\add their lives\add*. 
\v 17 Note this: Those who do not \add trustingly\add* allow God to direct
\add their lives\add*, as children \add do\add*, will not enter the [MET] place where God rules.”
\s Luke 18:18-30 (Mt. 19:16-29; Mk. 10:17-30) 
\s Jesus taught that rich people do not easily let God rule their lives.
\p
\v 18 A \add Jewish\add* leader asked \add Jesus\add*, “Good teacher, what shall I do in order to have eternal life?”
\v 19 Jesus said to him, “Only God is good! No one \add else\add* is good! ◄So you(sg) should consider carefully what
\add you are implying by\add* calling me good!/\add Do you realize that you are implying that I am God
by\add* calling me good?► [RHQ] 
\p
\v 20  \add But to answer your question\add*, you\add (sg)\add* know the commandments that
\add God gave Moses. He commanded such things as\add* ‘do not commit adultery, do not commit murder, do not steal, do not
testify falsely \add about what you have seen or heard\add*, honor your father and mother.’ ”
\v 21 The man said, “I have obeyed all those \add commandments\add* ever since I was young.
\add So\add* ◄\add there must be something else I have not done./is that
enough\add*?►” 
\v 22 When Jesus heard \add him say\add* that, he replied to him, “There is one thing that
you\add (sg)\add* have not \add done\add* yet. Sell all that you own. Then give
\add the money\add* to poor people. \add The result will be that\add* you will have
\add spiritual\add* riches in heaven. Then come and be my disciple!”
\v 23 The man went away sad when he heard that, because he was very rich
\add and he did not want to give everything away\add*. 
\v 24 Jesus looked at him \add as the man left\add*, and he said, “It is very difficult for those who are wealthy
\add to decide\add* to let God rule [MET] their \add lives\add*.
\v 25  \add You would say\add* that it is impossible for a camel to go through the eye of a needle. It is
\add almost\add* as difficult [HYP] for rich people \add to decide\add* to let God rule their
\add lives\add*.” 
\v 26  \add The Jews thought that God favored rich people, so they thought that if God did not save rich people he would not
save others, either\add*. So \add one of the disciples\add* who heard him say that replied, “If that is so, it seems that no
one will be saved {\add that God\add* will not save anyone} [RHQ]!”
\v 27 But he said, “It is impossible for people \add to save themselves\add*. But
\add God can save them, because\add* God can do anything!” 
\v 28 Then Peter said, “\add You know that we(exc) have left\add* everything we had and have become your disciples [RHQ].
\add So what about us?\add* (OR\add , So will God accept/save us?\add*”)
\v 29 He said to them, “Keep this in mind: Those who have left \add their\add* homes,
\add their\add* wives, \add their\add* brothers, \add their\add* parents,
\add their\add* children, \add or any other family members\add*,
\add to tell others\add* about how God wants to rule [MET] \add people's
lives\add*, 
\v 30 will receive in this life many times as much \add as they left\add*. And in the future age they will ◄be living eternally
\add with God/\add*have eternal life►.” 
\s Luke 18:31-34 (Mt. 20:17-19; Mk. 10:32-34) 
\s Jesus again predicted his death and resurrection. 
\p
\v 31  \add Jesus\add* took the twelve \add disciples\add* to a place by themselves and said to them, “Listen carefully!
We\add (inc)\add* are \add now\add* going up to Jerusalem. \add While we are
there\add*, everything that has been written by the prophets {that the prophets have written} about
\add me\add*, the one who came from heaven, will be fulfilled {will occur}.
\v 32 I will be put {\add My enemies\add* will put me} into the hands of non-Jews.
\add The non-Jews\add* will make fun of me and mistreat me and spit on me.
\v 33 They will whip me, and \add then\add* they will kill me. But on the third day
\add after that\add* I will become alive again.” 
\v 34 But \add the disciples\add* did not understand any of those things that
\add he said\add*. They were prevented {\add Something\add* prevented them} from understanding the meaning of what
\add he\add* was telling \add them\add*. 
\s Luke 18:35-43 
\s Jesus healed a blind man. 
\p
\v 35 As \add Jesus and his disciples\add* came near to Jericho \add city\add*, a blind man was sitting beside the road.
\add He was\add* begging \add for money\add*. 
\v 36 When he heard the crowd \add of people\add* passing by, he asked someone, “What is happening?”
\v 37 They told him, “Jesus, \add the man\add* from Nazareth \add town\add*, is passing by.”
\v 38 He shouted, “Jesus, \add you who are Messiah\add* descended from
\add King\add* David, pity me!” 
\v 39 Those who were \add walking\add* at the front \add of the crowd\add* scolded him
\add and\add* told him to be quiet. But he shouted more loudly, “You who are the
\add Messiah\add* descended from \add King\add* David, pity me!”
\v 40 Jesus stopped and told \add people\add* to bring the man to him. When
\add the blind man\add* came near, Jesus asked him, 
\v 41 “What do you\add (sg)\add* want me to do for you?” He replied, “Lord, enable me to see
\add again\add*!” 
\v 42 Jesus said to him, “\add Then\add* see! Because you have trusted [PRS]
\add in me\add*, \add I\add* have healed you!” 
\v 43 Immediately he was able to see. And he went with \add Jesus\add*, praising God. And when all the people who were
\add going with him\add* saw it, they also praised God.
