\s Land for the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh 
\p
\v 1 The land that was allotted to the \add two tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh that were descended
from\add* Joseph started at the Jordan \add River\add*, east of the springs at Jericho.
\v 2 It extended west from Jericho to the hilly area near Bethel, which is also called Luz, to Ataroth, at the border of the
land where the Arki people-group lived. 
\v 3 From there it extended west to the border of the land where the Japhleti people-group lived, and then it extended west to
the area near Lower Beth-Horon. From there it extended west to Gezer
\add city\add* and from there \add to the Mediterranean\add* Sea.
\m
\v 4 That is the land that the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh were allotted.
\m
\v 5 The border of the land that was allotted to the clans of the tribe of Ephraim started at Ataroth-Addar
\add city\add* in the east. It extended to Upper Beth-Horon 
\v 6 and from there \add to the Mediterranean\add* Sea. 
\v 7 From Michmethath \add on the north\add* it extended east to Taanath and from there on to Janoah. From there it extended
\add south\add* to Ataroth \add city\add* and to Naarah \add town\add*. From there it extended to Jericho and from there to the
Jordan \add River\add*. 
\v 8 The \add northern\add* border extended from Tappuah west to Kanah Ravine, and ended at the
\add Mediterranean\add* Sea. That was the land that was allotted to the tribe of Ephraim.
\v 9 Many of those towns were really within the area allotted to the tribe of Manasseh.
\m
\v 10 The people of the tribe of Ephraim could not force the Canaan people-group to leave Gezer, so the Canaan people-group
still live among the people of the tribe of Ephraim, but the Israelis forced the people of the Canaan people-group to become
their slaves.
