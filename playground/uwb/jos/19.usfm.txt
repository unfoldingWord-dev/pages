that he chose. It was in the hilly region which was allotted to the tribe of Ephraim. Joshua rebuilt the city and lived there.
\p
\v 51 Those were the areas that were allotted to the various tribes of Israel. Eleazar the supreme priest and Joshua and the
leaders of each tribe divided up the land while they were all at Shiloh, by ◄casting lots/throwing marked stones►
\add to decide which area each tribe would receive\add*. They did that while Yahweh was watching, at the entrance of the Sacred
Tent. In that way they completed dividing up the land.
