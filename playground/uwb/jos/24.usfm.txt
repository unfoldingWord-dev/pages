\c 24  
\s Joshua encouraged the Israeli people to worship only Yahweh 
\p
\v 1  \add Many years later\add*, Joshua summoned representatives of all the tribes of Israel. He gathered together the elders,
the leaders, the judges, and the other officials at Shechem city. He told them to listen to what God wanted to tell them.
\v 2 Joshua said to all of them, “This is what Yahweh, the God we Israeli people worship, is saying: ‘Long ago, your ancestors,
including Abraham's father Terah and Abraham's younger brother Nahor, lived on the east side of the Euphrates River.
\v 3 But I took your ancestor Abraham from that land east of the Euphrates River, and I led him as he lived in various places
in this land of Canaan, and I enabled him to have many descendants. First, I enabled him to have a son, Isaac.
\v 4 When Isaac grew up, I enabled him to have twin sons, Jacob and Esau. I enabled Esau to live in the hilly area in Seir
region, but many years later Jacob and his sons and their families went down to live in Egypt.
\p
\v 5  \add Many years later\add*, I sent Moses and his older brother Aaron to Egypt, and I caused
\add the people of\add* Egypt to suffer very much because of what I did there. Then I enabled your ancestors to leave Egypt.
\v 6 When I brought your ancestors out of Egypt, they came to the Red Sea. The Egyptian army pursued them, some riding in
chariots and others on horses, and they also arrived at the Red Sea.
\v 7 Then \add your ancestors\add* pleaded with me to help them. So he caused darkness\f + \ft Or: a very dark cloud \f* to come between your
ancestors and the Egyptian army, so that the Egyptian army could not see your ancestors. I separated the water so that your
ancestors could cross it, but when the Egyptian army tried to cross in the same way to pursue them, I caused the water to come
back and cover them, and the Egyptian soldiers all drowned, as your ancestors watched and were amazed [IDI]. But after that,
you lived in the desert for many years. 
\p
\v 8 Then I brought you to the area where the groups who were descendants of Amor lived, east of the Jordan River. They fought
against you, but I enabled you to defeat them [IDI]. I \add enabled you
to\add* keep destroying them so that you could live in their land [IDI].
\v 9 Then, Zippor's son Balak, the King of Moab, decided that his army would fight against\f + \ft Or: opposed \f* the Israelis. He summoned
Beor's son Balaam and asked him to curse you. 
\v 10 But I would not do what Balaam asked, so he blessed\f + \ft Or: said that I would do great things for \f* you four times, and I did not
enable the army of Moab to defeat you [IDI]. 
\p
\v 11 Then you all crossed the Jordan River and came to Jericho. The people of Jericho prepared to fight against you, and
\add the armies of\add* the descendants of Amor, Periz, Canaan, Heth, Girgash, Hiv, and Jebus
\add all prepared to do\add* the same thing, but I enabled you to defeat [IDI] them all.
\v 12 I am the one who caused them to panic as you advanced and enabled you to defeat them, as I had enabled you to do earlier
to the two kings of the groups who were descendants of Amor. You did not defeat them by using your own bows and arrows and
swords; \add it was I who defeated them\add*. 
\v 13 So I gave you a land that you had not tilled\f + \ft Or: planted \f*, and I gave you cities that you did not build.
\add Now\add* you live in those \add cities\add* and you eat the grapes from the grapevines that you did not plant, and you eat
olives from trees that you did not plant.’ ” 
\p
\v 14  \add Then Joshua said to the people\add*, “\add Because of all
that\add* Yahweh \add has done for you\add*, have an awesome respect for him, and serve\f + \ft Or: worship \f* him very faithfully. Throw away
the idols that your ancestors worshiped on the east\f + \ft Or: other \f* side of the Euphrates River and in Egypt. Serve only Yahweh.
\v 15 But if you do not want to serve\f + \ft Or: worship \f* Yahweh, you should decide today what
\add gods\add* you will serve\f + \ft Or: worship \f*. You should decide whether you will serve\f + \ft Or: worship \f* the gods that your ancestors who lived
on the other\f + \ft Or: east \f* side of the Euphrates River served, or whether you will serve\f + \ft Or: worship \f* the gods that the descendants of Amor,
who previously lived in the land where you are now living, \add serve\f + \ft Or: worship \f*\add*. But as for me and my family \f + \ft metonymy \f*, we will
serve\f + \ft Or: worship \f* Yahweh!” 
\p
\v 16 The Israeli people answered, “We will never quit \add serving\f + \ft Or: worshiping \f*\add* Yahweh! We would never
\add think of\add* [IDI] serving\f + \ft Or: worshiping \f* other gods! 
\v 17 It was our God, Yahweh, who brought our parents and grandparents up out of Egypt.
\add He rescued them\add* from that land where they were slaves. As he rescued them, they saw him perform great miracles. He
protected them all the time when they were traveling. He protected them from all the people-groups through whose territory they
traveled. 
\v 18 As our forefathers advanced, Yahweh expelled the descendants of Amor and the other people-groups who lived in this land.
Yahweh is our God, so \add we are saying that\add* we also will serve\f + \ft Or: worship \f* him.”
\p
\v 19 Joshua replied to the people, “\add I think that\add* you are not able to serve\f + \ft Or: worship \f* Yahweh, because he is a holy God.
He will not forgive your sinning and rebelling \add against him\add*. He demands that you serve\f + \ft Or: worship \f* only him [IDI].
\v 20 He was good to you \add before\add*, but if you turn away from him and serve\f + \ft Or: worship \f* foreign\f + \ft Or: other \f* gods, he will turn
\add against you\add* and he will cause disasters to \add happen
to\add* you. He will punish [IDI] you severely!” 
\v 21 But the people replied to Joshua, “No, \add we will not turn away from worshiping\f + \ft Or: serving \f*
Yahweh\add*! We will serve\f + \ft Or: worship \f* Yahweh!” 
\p
\v 22 Then Joshua said, “You yourselves are saying that you have decided to serve\f + \ft Or: worship \f* Yahweh.” They replied, “Yes, we are
saying that.” 
\v 23 Then Joshua said, “Since \add you have decided\add* that, you must throw away all the other gods\f + \ft Or: idols \f* that you have
among you, and promise that you will wholeheartedly give yourselves to Yahweh, the God whom we Israelis
\add serve\f + \ft Or: worship \f*\add*.” 
\v 24 The people replied, “We will serve\f + \ft Or: worship \f* Yahweh, our God, and obey him.”
\p
\v 25 That day, Joshua made an agreement between the people and Yahweh. He wrote for them all the laws that they were required
to obey. 
\v 26 He wrote all these laws on a scroll. He called it 'The laws of God.' Then he
\add told some men to\add* set up a large stone there at Shechem, under the
\add large\add* oak tree near the place where \add they worshiped\add* Yahweh.
\v 27 He said to all the people, “Look! It is as though this stone has heard everything
\add that Yahweh said\add* to you \add and that you\add* \add promised
Yahweh\add*. It will be a witness against you if you rebel against your God!”
\p
\v 28 Then Joshua sent the people away, and all of them returned to their own areas\f + \ft Or: homes \f*.
\s \add Joshua died\add* 
\p
\v 29 Some time after that, Nun's son Joshua, the faithful servant of Yahweh, died. He was 110 years old when he died.
\v 30 The Israeli people buried his body on his own property in Timnath-Serah town. It is north of Gaash Mountain in the hilly
area of the tribe who were descendants of Ephraim. 
\v 31 The Israeli people served\f + \ft Or: worshiped \f* Yahweh as long as Joshua was alive. After Joshua died, they continued
serving\f + \ft Or: worshiping \f* Yahweh while the elders who had experienced everything that Yahweh had done for the Israeli people were
still alive. 
\v 32 Joseph's bones, which the Israeli people had brought up there from Egypt, were buried at Shechem. The people buried them
in the piece of land that Jacob had bought long ago for a hundred pieces of silver from Hamor, the father of Shechem. That
piece of land was in the area that was given to the people who were descendants of Ephraim and Manasseh, Joseph's sons.
\v 33 Eleazar, the supreme priest, the son of Aaron, also died. They buried his body at Gibeah, in the area that had been given
to Eleazar's son Phinehas, in the hilly area that belonged to the people who were descendants of Ephraim.
