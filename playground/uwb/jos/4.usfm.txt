\c 4  
\s The Israeli people and Joshua set up memorials 
\p
\v 1 After all the people of the Israeli nation had finished crossing the Jordan
\add River\add*, Yahweh said to Joshua, 
\v 2 "When you choose the twelve men, one from each tribe, whom I mentioned previously, tell them to pick up
\add large\add* stones from the middle of the Jordan riverbed, where the priests are
\add still\add* standing. 
\v 3 Tell them to carry the stones with you and put them down at the place where you will stay tonight."
\p
\v 4 So Joshua chose twelve men, one from each tribe. He called them together, and said to them,
\v 5 "Go into the middle of the Jordan riverbed, to where \add the priests are standing,
holding\add* the chest that Yahweh, your God, gave you. Each of you must pick up a
\add large\add* stone, one for each tribe, \add and carry it\add* on your shoulder
\add to our camp\add*. 
\v 6  \add Then pile them up\add* to be a memorial for you. In the future, when your children ask, 'What do these stones
mean?,' 
\v 7 tell them that the water in the Jordan River was blocked off when the priests were carrying the chest
\add that contained\add* the Ten Commandments that Yahweh \add gave
us\add*. When the chest was carried into the Jordan \add River\add*, the water was blocked off
\add so that we could cross the riverbed\add*. These stones will be a memorial to the descendants of us Israeli people
forever." 
\p
\v 8 So those Israeli men did what Joshua told them to do. They went and picked up twelve
\add large\add* stones from the middle of the Jordan \add riverbed\add*, one stone for each of the tribes, just as Yahweh had
told Joshua. They carried the stones to their camp and put them down.
\v 9 Then Joshua set up twelve \add other large\add* stones \add in a
pile\add*, in the middle of the Jordan \add riverbed\add*, where the priests who carried the chest containing the Ten
Commandments were standing. And those stones are still there. 
\p
\v 10 The priests who carried the chest remained standing in the middle of the Jordan
\add riverbed\add* until the people had finished doing everything that Yahweh had commanded Joshua to tell them to do. Those
were the same instructions that Moses had given to Joshua. The Israeli people crossed
\add the riverbed\add* quickly. 
\v 11 As soon as all of them had crossed, as the people watched, the priests carried the chest.
\v 12 The soldiers of the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and of half of the soldiers of the tribe of Manasseh, crossed over ahead of
the rest of the Israeli people, carrying their weapons, as Moses had commanded.
\v 13 As Yahweh was watching, there were about forty thousand of those soldiers, carrying weapons ready for battle, who crossed
the riverbed to the plains near Jericho, \add ready\add* to fight.
\p
\v 14 On that day, all the people of Israel saw that Yahweh had made Joshua to be a great leader. And they honored Joshua for
the rest of his life, just as they had honored Moses. 
\v 15 Yahweh said to Joshua, 
\v 16 "\add Now\add* tell the priests who are carrying the chest containing the Ten Commandments to come up from the Jordan
\add riverbed\add*." 
\v 17 So Joshua commanded the priests to do that. 
\v 18 Then the priests, carrying the chest containing the Ten Commandments that Yahweh
\add had given to Moses\add*, came up out of the riverbed. And as soon as they walked up out of the riverbed onto the
riverbank, the water of the Jordan \add River\add* flowed again, and flooded
\add over the river banks\add* as it had done before. 
\p
\v 19 It was on the tenth day of the first month \add of that year\add* that the people crossed over the Jordan
\add River\add* and camped at \add a place called\add* Gilgal, on the east side of
\add the land near\add* Jericho \add city\add*. 
\v 20 The men \add who were carrying\add* the twelve \add large\add* stones from the Jordan
\add riverbed brought them to\add* Joshua, \add and he set them up at
Gilgal\add*. 
\v 21 Joshua said to the Israeli people, "In the future, when your children and grandchildren ask, 'What do these stones
\add mean\f + \ft Or: Why are these stones here \f*\add*?', 
\v 22 tell them, 'We Israeli people crossed the Jordan \add River\add*
\add as though\add* we were crossing on dry ground. 
\v 23 As we were watching, Yahweh, your God, dried up the river until we had all crossed over. Yahweh, the God whom we worship,
did to the Jordan \add River\add* just like he did to the Red Sea, when he caused it to become dry as
\add our parents\add* were watching, until they all crossed over.
\v 24 Yahweh did that in order that all the people-groups of the earth may know that he \f + \ft metonymy \f* is very powerful, and in order
that you may always be in awe of\f + \ft Or: respect \f* Yahweh, your God.'Â "
