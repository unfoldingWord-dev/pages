\c 7  
\s The men of Ai defeated the Israelis 
\p
\v 1 Yahweh had commanded that all the things that \add they had captured in
Jericho\add* should be \add destroyed to show that it belongs\add* to him. But there was a man from the tribe of Judah named
Achan. He was the son of Carmi and grandson of Zabdi and great-grandson of Zerah. He disobeyed what Yahweh
\add had commanded\add* and took for himself some of those things. So Yahweh was very angry with the Israelis.
\p
\v 2 Joshua told some of his men to go from Jericho to Ai \add town\add*, which was east of Bethel
\add city\add* and near Beth-Aven \add town\add*. He said to them, “Go to Ai and spy out the area\f + \ft Or: see what the area is like \f*.”
So the men went. 
\p
\v 3 When they returned to Joshua they said, “There are only a few people in Ai. So we do not need to send all of our soldiers
to defeat them. Send two thousand or three thousand men to attack them. That will be enough.”
\v 4 So about three thousand Israeli men went \add to attack Ai\add*. But the men of Ai defeated them badly.
\v 5 They killed about thirty-six Israelis and chased the rest of Israeli men from the city gate to the bottom of the hill.
When the other Israelis saw that this had happened, they became very discouraged.
\p
\v 6 Joshua and the other Israeli leaders tore their clothes \add because they were very sad about being
defeated\add*. They prostrated themselves on the ground in front of the
\add Sacred Tent in which was\add* the sacred chest. They stayed there until that evening. They also threw dirt on their heads
\add to show that they were very sad about what had happened\add*.
\v 7 Then Joshua prayed and said, “Lord God, you brought us Israelis
\add safely\add* across the Jordan River. So why are you now allowing the Amor people-group to defeat us \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*?
\add This would not have happened\add* if we had stayed on the other side of the Jordan River!
\v 8 Lord, we Israelis have been defeated by our enemies, so I do not know what to say now \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*.
\v 9 The Canaan people-group and all the other people who are living in this land will hear about this. Then they will surround
us and kill all of us! Then what will you do to defend your reputation \f + \ft metonymy \f*\f + \ft Or: to show that you are a powerful God \f*?”
\p
\v 10 But Yahweh said to Joshua, “Stand up! Stop lying there with your face on the ground \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*!
\v 11 You Israelis have sinned! You have disobeyed the commands that I told you to obey.
\add One of\add* your men has taken some of the things that I told you to destroy. He has stolen them and taken them for
himself and lied \add about it\add*. 
\v 12 That is why you Israelis have been unable to be strong when you went to attack your enemies. That is why you have run
away from them. And now you yourselves may be destroyed. If you do not do as I commanded you and destroy everything
\add that you captured in Jericho\add* I will not help you anymore!”
\s Achan was punished for his sin 
\p
\v 13 “Now go and tell this to the people: ‘Tomorrow you must \add perform the
rituals\add* that will cause yourselves to become acceptable to Yahweh again. Yahweh, the God whom we Israelis
\add worship\add*, says that one of you has kept things that he told you to destroy. You will never defeat your enemies until
you get rid of those things. 
\p
\v 14 Tomorrow morning you must present yourselves before Yahweh, tribe by tribe. Then Yahweh will indicate to which tribe
\add the man who took those things belongs\add*. Then Yahweh will indicate to which clan from that tribe
\add the guilty man belongs\add*. Then Yahweh will indicate to which family he belongs. And then he will indicate which person
\add in that family took them\add*. 
\v 15 Then the one who has taken some of the things that should have been destroyed will be destroyed in a fire. And everything
he owns will be destroyed with him, because he has disobeyed the command that Yahweh gave us and has done something that is
disgraceful to us Israeli people.’ ” 
\p
\v 16 Early the next morning, Joshua told all the Israeli people to stand before the Sacred Tent, tribe by tribe.
\add When they did that\add*, Yahweh indicated that a man from the tribe of Judah
\add was the one who had taken the things\add*. 
\v 17 Then the clans of Judah presented themselves, and Yahweh indicated that someone from the clan of Zerah was the guilty
one. Then the families of Zerah's clan presented themselves, and Yahweh indicated that someone from the family of Zabdi
\add was the guilty one\add*. 
\v 18 Then Joshua told the men from that family to present themselves. And Yahweh indicated that Achan was guilty.
\p
\v 19 Then Joshua said to Achan, “Son, tell the truth [IDI]. Confess to Yahweh, the God whom we Israelis
\add worship, what you have done\add*. And tell me what you did, and do not try to ◄conceal anything\f + \ft Or: prevent \f* me from knowing
what you did►.” 
\p
\v 20 Achan replied, “It is true. I have sinned against Yahweh, the God whom we Israelis
\add worship\add*. 
\v 21 Among the things \add in Jericho\add* that I saw was a beautiful coat from Babylonia. I also saw 200 pieces of silver and
some gold that weighed as much as 50 pieces of silver. I wanted those things very much for myself, so I took them. I buried
them all in the ground under my tent. You will find them there. The silver is buried under the other things.”
\p
\v 22 So Joshua sent some men \add to find those things\add*. They ran to Achan's tent and found all the things hidden there.
\v 23 The men brought them all out of the tent and took them to Joshua and the rest of the Israeli people. Then they
spread\f + \ft Or: laid \f* them out on the ground, where Yahweh could see them.
\p
\v 24 Then Joshua and the rest of the people led Achan down to the valley. They also took down there the silver, the coat, the
gold, Achan's \add wife and\add* sons and daughters, and his cattle and donkeys and sheep, and his tent, and everything else
that he owned. 
\v 25 Joshua said, “I do not know why you caused so much trouble for us\f + \ft Or: You have caused a lot of trouble for us \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*, but
now Yahweh will bring trouble to you.” Then all the people threw stones at Achan and his family until they all died. Then the
people burned their corpses. 
\p
\v 26 They piled rocks over \add the ashes of their corpses\add*, and those rocks are still there. That is why that valley is
called Trouble Valley. After that, Yahweh was no longer angry \add with the Israeli
people\add*.
