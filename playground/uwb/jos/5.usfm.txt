\c 5  
\p
\v 1 All the kings of the people-groups to the west of the Jordan River and all the kings of the groups who were descendants of
Canaan and who lived close to the \add Mediterranean\add* Sea heard about how Yahweh had dried up the water of the Jordan
\add River\add* until all we Israeli people had crossed over. So they became very dismayed. They no longer had the courage to
fight us. 
\s The Israeli males were circumcised at Gilgal 
\p
\v 2 While \add they were camped at Gilgal\add*, Yahweh said to Joshua,
“\add The Israeli males who lived in Egypt were circumcised before they left
there\add*. \add Now\add* make knives from flint stones and circumcise all the Israeli males
\add who have been born since then\add*.” 
\v 3 So Joshua \add made knives and\add* circumcised the Israeli males at a place that is now called 'Circumcision Hill.'
\v 4  \add The reason they did that is that all the men who left
Egypt\add*, those who were old enough to be soldiers, died in the desert after they left Egypt.
\v 5 They had been circumcised in Egypt, but the baby boys who had been born while their parents were camping in the desert
after they left Egypt had not been circumcised. 
\v 6 Our Israeli ancestors traveled around in the desert for forty years, and all the men who were old enough to be soldiers
had died. \add The women had also died\add*. They had not obeyed Yahweh, so Yahweh solemnly said that they would not arrive at
the land that he had promised to our ancestors that he would give to us, a land that was very fertile \f + \ft metonymy \f*.
\v 7 The sons of those who had disobeyed Yahweh were the ones whom Joshua circumcised at Gilgal. They were circumcised because
they had not been circumcised \add while they were traveling in the
desert\add*. 
\v 8 After all the Israeli males had been circumcised, they remained in the camp and rested until their wounds were healed.
\v 9 Then Yahweh said to Joshua, “Because your forefathers were wandering without divine help in the desert for forty years
\f + \ft Or: \add Because your forefathers were slaves in Egypt\add* \f*, the Egyptians felt disgusted toward you. But today I have taken
away the reproach the Egyptians have had toward you.” Because of that, the people called the place 'Gilgal,'
\add which sounds like the Hebrew word 'taken away,'\add* and it still has that name.
\p
\v 10 In the evening of the fourteenth day of that month, while the Israeli people were camped at Gilgal, on the plain near
Jericho \add city\add*, they celebrated the Passover. 
\v 11 The next day, they found some barley grain in the fields in that area. So they took that and roasted it and ate it with
bread that was made without yeast. 
\v 12 The next day, \add God stopped sending\add* manna from the sky for the Israeli people to eat. After that, they ate food
that was grown in Canaan. 
\s The commander of Yahweh's army appeared to Joshua. 
\p
\v 13 One day when Joshua came near to Jericho, he looked up and saw a man standing in front of him. The man was holding a
sword in his hand. Joshua approached him and asked him, “Are you
\add going to fight\add* for us or against us?” 
\v 14 The man replied, “I am not \add planning to fight with you\add* or
\add against you\add*. Instead, I am the commander of Yahweh's army
\add in heaven\add*, and I have come down \add from there to assure you that Yahweh will help
you\add*.” Then Joshua bowed down with his face on the ground to show his respect for\f + \ft Or: to worship \f* the man, and said to him,
“Tell me what \add you want me to do\add*.” 
\v 15 The commander of Yahweh's army replied, “Take off your sandals!
\add I am Yahweh, and\add* the ground on which you are standing is holy because I am here.” So Joshua took off his sandals.
