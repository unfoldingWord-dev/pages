\s Cities of refuge 
\p
\v 1 Then Yahweh said to Joshua, 
\v 2 "Tell the Israeli people that they should choose some cities to which people
\add can run\add* in order to be safe\f + \ft Or: protected \f*, like I told Moses that you should do.
\v 3 If someone kills another person accidentally, not intending to kill that person, the one who killed that person may
run\f + \ft Or: escape \f* to one of these cities and be safe\f + \ft Or: protected \f* from someone trying to get revenge for that person's death \f + \ft metonymy \f*.
\p
\v 4 When the one who killed someone arrives at the gate of one of those cities, he must stop there and tell the leaders of the
city what happened. \add If they believe him\add*, they must allow him to enter the city, and they must give him a place to
live among them. 
\v 5 If some relative of the one who was killed comes to that city to get revenge, the leaders of that city must not allow the
relative to take the killer, because what happened was accidental. He did not deliberately hate that person and as a result
deliberately kill him. 
\v 6 But the person who killed someone else must stay in that city until the city judges put him on trial.
\add Only\add* if the judges decide \add that the person who has run\f + \ft Or: escaped \f* to their city did not deliberately kill the other
person will they allow him to stay in that city\add*, and he must stay there until the supreme priest dies. Then he may safely
go back to his own town, \add because the death of the supreme priest will be considered to atone\f + \ft Or: pay \f* for the death of the
person who was killed\add*." 
\p
\v 7 So the Israelis chose these cities to be cities to which people could run to be safe\f + \ft Or: protected \f*: Kedesh in the Galilee
district in the hilly area where the tribe of Naphtali lived; Shechem in the hilly area where the tribe of Ephraim lived;
Kiriath-Arba (which is \add now named\add* Hebron) in the hilly area where the tribe of Judah lived;
\v 8 Bezer, on the east side of the Jordan \add River\add* near Jericho, in the flat land in the desert where the tribe of
Reuben lived; Ramoth in the Gilead \add region\add* in the land where the tribe of Gad lived; and Golan in the Bashan region
where the tribe of Manasseh lived. 
\v 9 Any Israeli or any foreigner who lived among us, anyone who killed someone accidentally\f + \ft Or: without planning to do it \f*, was
allowed to run to one of those cities, and be safe\f + \ft Or: protected \f* from some relative of the person who died coming there and killing
him to get revenge. He could stay in that city until there was a trial there
\add to decide whether he was telling the truth or not when he said that he did not plan to kill that
person\add*.
