\c 6  
\s The walls of Jericho collapsed and the Israelis captured the city.
\p
\v 1 Meanwhile, the guards of Jericho shut the gates of the city tightly, because
\add they were afraid\add* of the Israeli \add army\add*. No one was allowed to go into the city or go out of it.
\v 2 Then Yahweh said to Joshua, “Listen \add to what I say\add*! I am going to enable your army \f + \ft synecdoche \f* to capture\f + \ft Or: conquer \f* \f + \ft metonymy \f*
Jericho and its king and its soldiers. 
\v 3 So your army must march around the city for six days, once each day.
\v 4 Tell seven priests to march around with them. Each priest must carry a trumpet. Four other priests must carry the sacred
chest, and they must walk behind the priests who are carrying the trumpets. On the seventh day, the army must march around the
city seven times, and the priests must be blowing the trumpets while they march.
\v 5 After \add they have all marched around the city seven times\add*, the priests must blow their trumpets
\add once\add*, very loudly. When the Israeli people\f + \ft Or: soldiers \f* hear that, they must shout loudly. Then the wall of the city will
collapse, and all the Israeli people\f + \ft Or: soldiers \f* will go straight into the city.”
\p
\v 6 So Joshua summoned the priests and said to them, “Tell four priests to carry the chest
\add that contains\add* the Ten Commandments that Yahweh \add gave to
us\add*. \add Tell\add* seven \add other\add* priests to carry trumpets and walk in front of them.”
\v 7 And Joshua told the soldiers, “Start marching! March around the city, with several soldiers with weapons marching in
front. Behind them will march the seven priests with trumpets, and behind them will march the four priests carrying Yahweh's
\add sacred\add* chest.” 
\p
\v 8 After Joshua told that to the army, the seven priests, each carrying a sacred trumpet, started marching, blowing their
trumpets. The four priests who were carrying Yahweh's sacred chest followed them.
\v 9 The group of soldiers carrying weapons marched in front of the priests who were blowing their trumpets, and the rest of
the soldiers followed \add the four men carrying\add* the chest. While
\add they were all marching\add*, \add the seven priests\add* were blowing their trumpets.
\v 10 But \add the rest of the people were silent, because\add* Joshua had commanded them, “Do not make a war cry. Do not yell
or say anything until the day when I tell you to shout. On that day, you must shout
\add loudly\add*!” 
\v 11 So the men carrying Yahweh's sacred chest and all the others did what Joshua told them to do. They marched around the
city once. Then they all returned to the camp and stayed there that night.
\p
\v 12 The next morning, Joshua and the priests got up early, and the four priests started carrying Yahweh's sacred chest
\add again\add*. 
\v 13 The seven priests who were carrying trumpets went in front of
\add the men carrying\add* the chest. The seven priests were blowing their trumpets as they marched. The group of soldiers
carrying weapons went in front of all the others, and the rest of the army followed all the others. All the time, the seven
priests were blowing their trumpets. 
\v 14 So on that second day they again marched around the city once and then returned to the camp. They did the same thing for
six days. 
\p
\v 15 On the seventh day, they got up at dawn, and they all marched around the city the same way that they had done before, but
this time they marched around the city seven times. 
\v 16 As they were marching around the seventh time, when the priests were about to blow the long\f + \ft Or: loud \f* blast on their trumpets,
Joshua commanded the people, “Shout, because Yahweh is going to enable you to capture the city!
\v 17 Yahweh has declared that you must destroy [IDI] the city and everything in it
\add to show that it belongs to him\add*. You must spare only Rahab the prostitute and the others who are in her house, because
she hid the spies whom we sent there. 
\v 18 And because Yahweh has declared that everything must be destroyed [IDI], you must not take \f + \ft euphemism \f* any of the things in the
city. If you take anything, you will cause Yahweh to destroy our own camp and cause terrible things to happen to us.
\v 19 But all the silver and gold and articles made from iron and bronze that you find, you must set apart for Yahweh. You must
put those things in his treasury.” 
\p
\v 20 So they did what Joshua told them to do. And when the priests blew a long blast on their trumpets, the people\f + \ft Or: army \f*
shouted loudly, and the wall of the city collapsed! Then the Israeli soldiers rushed in and captured the city.
\v 21 They killed [IDI] every living thing in the city—men and women, young people and old people, even cattle and sheep and
donkeys. 
\p
\v 22 Then Joshua said to the two men who had spied on\f + \ft Or: whom he had sent to learn all they could about \f* the land, “Go to the
prostitute's house. Bring her out, along with all her family, just you solemnly promised to her.”
\v 23-25 So those two spies\f + \ft Or: men \f* went into Rahab's house and brought her out. They also brought out her father and mother and
her brothers, and all the rest of her family. Joshua's men spared Rahab the prostitute. They also did not kill all her
relatives, because she had hidden and protected the spies\f + \ft Or: men \f* whom Joshua had sent to Jericho. The two men brought them all out
and put them in a place outside the camp of the Israelis. Rahab still lives among us Israeli people. Then the soldiers gathered
the articles made from silver, gold, bronze, and iron that they found and put them all into Yahweh's treasury. But they burned
everything else that was in the city. 
\p
\v 26 At that time, Joshua declared this very solemnly: “Yahweh will curse\f + \ft Or: punish \f* anyone who tries to rebuild this city,
Jericho. When that person lays\f + \ft Or: builds \f* its foundation, his oldest son will die. And when he finishes building the city wall and
sets up its gates, his youngest son will die.” 
\p
\v 27 Because of what happened that day, it was clear that Yahweh was with\f + \ft Or: helped \f* Joshua, and Joshua became famous throughout
the land.
