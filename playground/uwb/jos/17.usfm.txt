\v 1  \add This is a list of\add* the land that was allotted to the tribe of Manasseh. Manasseh's oldest son was Makir and his
grandson was Gilead. Makir's descendants were great warriors, so the lands in the Gilead and Bashan area were allotted to their
clan. 
\v 2 Land was also allotted to the other clans of the tribe of Manasseh: the clans of Abiezer, Helek, Asriel, Shechem, Hepher,
and Shemida. 
\p
\v 3 Hepher's son Zelophehad had no sons, but he had five daughters: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.
\v 4 They went to Eleazar the supreme priest, and to Joshua and to the other Israeli leaders. They said,
"\add We want you to give us some land, because\add* Yahweh told Moses that he should give to us some land, just like you gave
to the men." So Eleazar did what Yahweh had commanded, and he allotted to them some land, just like he allotted to their
uncles. 
\v 5 So the tribe of Manasseh eventually had ten sections \add of land west of the Jordan
River\add* and \add two sections\add*, Gilead and Bashan, on the east side of the Jordan
\add River\add*. 
\v 6 So these female descendants of Manasseh also were allotted land
\add on the west side of the river\add* just like the men were allotted. The other parts of the Gilead area were allotted to
the male descendants of Manasseh. 
\pi
\v 7 The land allotted to the tribe of Manasseh was between the land where the tribe of Asher lives and Michmethath
\add town\add*, near Shechem \add city\add*. The border extended south to the Tappuah Spring.
\v 8 The land near the Tappuah area belonged to the tribe of Manasseh, but the town of Tappuah, which was at the border of the
land that was allotted to the tribe of Manasseh, was allotted to the tribe of Ephraim.
\v 9 The border \add of the land allotted to the tribe of Manasseh\add* extended south to Kanah Gorge. From there it extended
\add west\add* along the north side of the gorge and ended at the
\add Mediterranean\add* Sea. 
\v 10 The land on the south side of the gorge belonged to the tribe of Ephraim, and the land on the north side belonged to the
tribe of Manasseh. The western border of the land allotted to the tribe of Manasseh was the
\add Mediterranean\add* Sea. To the north, the border of their land extended from the land allotted to the tribe of Asher
\add at the northwest\add* to the land allotted to the tribe of Issachar
\add at the north\add* east. 
\pi
\v 11 But there are cities inside the area allotted to the tribes of Issachar and Asher, that along with their surrounding
villages, were allotted to people from the tribe of Manasseh. These cities are Beth-Shan, Ibleam, Dor (which is also named
Naphoth-Dor,) Endor, Taanach, and Megiddo. 
\m
\v 12 The men of the tribe of Manasseh were not able to force the people who lived in those cities to leave, so the people of
the Canaan people-group continued to live in those cities. 
\v 13 But \add years later\add* when the Israelis became better \add warriors\add*, they forced the Canaan people-group to work
for them as slaves, although they did not force them to leave the land.
\p
\v 14 The people of the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh said to Joshua, "You allotted to us only one area of land, but we are
very numerous. Yahweh has blessed us very much \add with the result that our tribe has grown very
large\add*. So why did you give us only a small part of the land?" \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\p
\v 15 Joshua replied to them, "\add I agree that\add* you do not have enough land in the hilly area of the tribe of Ephraim.
So, since you have a lot of people, I wlll allot more land to you, in the hilly region. But you will have to
\add cut down the trees\add* in the forest and make a place for yourselves in the land where the Periz and Repha people-groups
live." 
\p
\v 16 The people of the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh replied, "It is true that the land in the hilly area is not big enough
for us, but the Canaan people-group who live in the lowlands, in Beth-Shan and the surrounding villages in that area, and in
the Jezreel Valley, have iron chariots, \add so we will not be able to defeat
them\add*!" 
\p
\v 17 Joshua replied to them, "Your tribe is very numerous and very powerful. So I will allot more land for you in the hilly
area, 
\v 18 but you will have to cut down the trees in order to make a place for you to live.
\add It is true that\add* the Canaan people-group are strong and have iron chariots, but you will be able to force them to
leave that valley."
