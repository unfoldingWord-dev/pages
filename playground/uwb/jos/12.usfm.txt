\s The kings defeated by the Israelis 
\p
\v 1 The Israelis took control of the land that was east of the Jordan River, from the Arnon River gorge
\add in the south\add* to Hermon Mountain \add in the north\add*, including all the land on the eastern side of the Jordan
\add River\add* Valley. That land previously belonged to the two kings whose armies the Israelis defeated.
\m
\v 2 One of them was Sihon, the king of the Amor people-group. He lived in Heshbon
\add city\add* and ruled over the area from Aroer \add town\add* along the Arnon River gorge, north to the Jabbok River. His
land started in the middle of the gorge, which was the border between his land and the land of the Ammon people-group. Sihon
also ruled over \add the southern\add* half of the Gilead region,
\v 3 and over the land on the eastern side of the Jordan River Valley, from Galilee
\add Lake south\add* to the Dead Sea. He also ruled over the land
\add east of the Dead Sea\add* from Beth-Jeshimoth south to the side of Pisgah Mountain.
\m
\v 4 The other king whom the Israeli army defeated was Og, the king of the Bashan
\add region\add*. He was the last of the descendants of \add the
giant\add* Rapha. He ruled that land from Ashtaroth and Edrei \add cities\add*.
\v 5 He ruled over the area from Hermon Mountain and Salecah \add in the
north\add*, and over all the Bashan area in the east, and to the borders of the kingdoms of Geshur and Maacah to the west. Og
ruled \add the northern\add* half of the Gilead region, as far as the border of the land ruled by King Sihon.
\p
\v 6 Moses, the man who served Yahweh \add well\add*, and all the Israeli army defeated the armies of those kings. Then Moses
gave that land to the tribes of Reuben and Gad and half of the tribe of Manasseh.
\p
\v 7 Joshua and the Israeli army also defeated kings who ruled over the land on the west side of the Jordan
\add River\add*. He gave that land to the Israeli people, dividing it among the other tribes. That land was between Baal-Gad
\add city\add* in the Lebanon Valley \add in the far north\add* \add all the way
south\add* to Halak Mountain, which is near the land of the Edom people-group.
\v 8 That land included the mountains, the western hilly area, the Jordan River Valley, the
\add western\add* slopes of the mountains, the desert \add in Judea\add*, and the Negev
\add desert in the south\add*. That whole area was the land where the Heth, Amor, Canaan, Periz, Hiv, and Jebus people-groups
lived. The Israeli army defeated the armies of the kings of each of these cities:
