\s Land for the tribe of Judah 
\p
\v 1 The land that was allotted to the tribe of Judah was divided among its clans. That land extended south to the Zin Desert,
at the border of the Edom region. 
\pi
\v 2 The southern border of the land that was allotted to the tribe of Judah started at the south end of the Dead Sea
\add and extended west\add*. 
\v 3 It extended south of Scorpion Pass to Zin Desert, and from there west to a place south of Kadesh-Barnea, past Hezron
\add town\add*, to Addar \add town\add*, and from there it turned
\add northwest\add* to Karka \add town\add*. 
\v 4 From there it continued to Azmon, and from there to the dry riverbed on the border of Egypt, and from there
\add west to the Mediterranean Sea\add*. That was the southern border.
\pi
\v 5 The eastern border of the land of the tribe of Judah was the Dead Sea, and it extended
\add north\add* to \add where the Jordan River ends at\add* the Dead Sea.
\pi
\v 6 The northern border started where the Jordan River ends at the Dead Sea. It extended
\add north\add* to Beth-Hoglah \add town\add*, and from there it extended north of Beth-Arabah
\add town\add* to the \add big\add* stone \add set up by\add* Reuben's son Bohan.
\v 7 From there the border continued west through Achor Valley to Debir
\add city\add*. From there it turned north to Gilgal \add city\add*. Gilgal is north of the road that goes through Adummim
Pass, on the south side of the valley. From Gilgal the border extended west to the springs at En-Shemesh, and from there to
En-Rogel. From there it extended through Ben-Hinnom Valley, south of the city where the Jebus people-group lived. (That city is
now named Jerusalem.) 
\v 8 From there the border extended to the top of the hill on the west side of Hinnom Valley, at the northern end of the valley
where the Repha \add giants\add* lived. 
\v 9 From there the border extended \add northwest\add* to Nephtoah Spring, and from there to the cities near Ephron Mountain.
From there the border extended \add west\add* toward Baalah, which is now named Kiriath-Jearim.
\v 10 Then the border continued to extend west to Seir Mountain. Then it continued
\add southwest\add* along the north side of Jearim Mountain, which is also named Kesalon, to Beth-Shemesh
\add city\add*. From there it extended \add northwest\add* past Timnah
\add city\add*, 
\v 11 to the hill north of Ekron \add city\add*. From there it extended
\add west\add* to Shikkeron \add town\add* and past Baalah Mountain to Jabneel
\add town\add*, then \add northwest\add* to the \add Mediterranean\add* Sea.
\pi
\v 12 The western border of the land that was allotted to the tribe of Judah was the
\add Mediterranean Sea\add*. All the clans of Judah lived inside those borders.
\p
\v 13 Yahweh commanded Joshua to give part of the land for the tribe of Judah to Caleb. So he gave to Caleb Kiriath-Arba
\add city\add*, which is now named Hebron. (Arba was the ancestor of the Anak people-group.)
\v 14 Caleb forced the three clans of the Anak people-group to leave Hebron. Those were the Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai clans.
\v 15 Then Caleb left there and went to fight against the people living in Debir
\add city\add*, which was previously named Kiriath-Sepher. 
\v 16 Caleb said, "If someone attacks \add the people in\add* Kiriath-Sepher and captures their city, I will give my daughter
Acsah to him to be his wife." 
\v 17 Othniel, the son of Caleb's brother Kenaz, captured the city. So Caleb gave his daughter to him.
\p
\v 18 When Caleb's daughter married Othniel, she told him to ask her father to give her a field. Then Acsah went to talk with
her father Caleb. As she got down from her donkey, Caleb asked her, "Do you want something?"
\p
\v 19 Acsah replied, "Yes, I want you to do something for me. You have given me some land in the southern part of Canaan,
\add but there is no water there\add*. So please give me some \add land that
has\add* springs." So Caleb gave her the upper and lower springs
\add near Hebron\add*. 
\p

allotted some of the land.
