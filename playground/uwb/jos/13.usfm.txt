\c 13  
\s The areas that the Israelis had not yet captured 
\p
\v 1 When Joshua was very old, Yahweh said to him, “Joshua, you are now an old man, but there is still a lot of land
\add for your army\add* to capture. 
\v 2 Here is a list of the land that remains: the Geshur region and all the area where the Philistia people-group live;
\v 3 the area where the Canaan people-group live, from the Shihor River
\add in the south\add* at the \add eastern\add* border of Egypt, to Ekron
\add city\add* in the north; the rulers of the five \add cities\add* of Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron; the area where
the Avva people-group live, 
\v 4 which is south of the area where the Canaan people-group live;
\v 5 the area where the Gebal people-group live; and all the Lebanon area east of Baal-Gad
\add city\add* at the bottom of Hermon Mountain, as far as Lebo-Hamath.
\p
\v 6 All the people of the Sidon people-group live in the hilly area from Lebanon to Misrephoth-Maim, but I will force them to
leave that area before you Israelis arrive there. Be sure to give that area to the Israeli people when you divide the land
among them, like I told you to do. 
\v 7 Divide all that land among the nine Israeli tribes and half of the tribe of Manasseh,
\add the tribes that do not have land on the east side of the Jordan
River\add*.” 
\s The land east of the Jordan River 
\m
\v 8 Half of the tribe of Manasseh and the tribes of Reuben and Gad had already been told what land they would receive, because
Moses, the man who served Yahweh \add well\add*, had already assigned to them the land on the east side of the Jordan
\add River\add*. 
\v 9 Their land extended from Aroer \add town\add* at the Arnon River gorge to the town in the middle of the gorge. It included
the whole plain from Medeba \add town south\add* to Dibon \add town\add*.
\v 10 All the towns ruled by King Sihon were in that area. The land extended to where the Ammon people-group lived.
\v 11 The Gilead area was also there, and the regions where the people of the Geshur and Maacah people-groups lived, and all of
Hermon Mountain and all the Bashan region \add south\add* to Salecah.
\v 12 All the land ruled by Og, the king who ruled the Bashan \add region\add*, was in that land. Og was one of the last
descendants of Repha; previously he had ruled in Ashtaroth and Edrei
\add cities\add*, but \add the armies of\add* Moses had defeated their armies and had taken their land from them.
\v 13 But the Israelis did not force the people of the Geshur and Maacah
\add people-groups\add* to leave their land, so they still live among the Israeli people.
\p
\v 14 The tribe of Levi was the only tribe that did not get any land. Instead, just like Yahweh promised, they continued to
receive \add food from\add* the sacrifices that were given to Yahweh, the God whom the Israelis
\add worship\add*, the sacrifices that were burned \add on the sacred
altar\add*. 
\p
\v 15 Moses had allotted land to each clan in the tribe of Reuben.
\v 16 Their land extended from Aroer \add town\add* near the Arnon River gorge to Medeba
\add town\add*. That included all of the plain \add that is near
Medeba\add* and the town in the middle of the gorge. 
\v 17 It also included Heshbon \add city\add* and all the nearby towns on the plain—Dibon, Bamioth-Baal, Beth-Baal-Meon,
\v 18 Jahaz, Kedemoth, Mephaath, 
\v 19 Kiriathaim, Sibmah, Zereth-Shahar on the hill overlooking the valley,
\v 20 Beth-Peor, the hills in the Pisgah area, and Beth-Jeshimoth.
\v 21 That land included all the towns on the plain and all the area that King Sihon had previously ruled. But
\add the army of\add* Moses had defeated him and the rulers of the Midian people-group: Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba. The
armies of all those rulers fought battles along with the army of Sihon, and they lived in that country.
\v 22 The Israeli army killed many people during those battles, including Balaam
\add the prophet\add* from Beor, who tried to use magic to predict\f + \ft Or: tell \f* what would happen in the future.
\v 23 The \add western\add* boundary of the land that was allotted to the clans of the tribe of Reuben was the Jordan
\add River\add*. 
\p
\v 24 Moses also allotted some land to each clan in the tribe of Gad.
\v 25 Their land included the Jazer \add area\add* and all the towns of the Gilead
\add area\add*; half of the land where the Ammon people-group lived, as far as Aroer
\add town which is\add* near Rabbah \add town\add*; 
\v 26 the area from Heshbon \add city\add* to Ramath-Mizpah and Betonim
\add towns; the area\add* from Mahanaim \add town\add* to the Debir region;
\v 27 Beth-Haram, Beth-Nimrah, Succoth, and Zaphon \add cities\add* in the valley; and the other area that King Sihon had ruled
on the east side of the Jordan River. That area extended \add north
to\add* the southern end of Galilee \add Lake\add*. 
\v 28 All this land, including the towns and villages, was allotted to the tribe of Gad.
\p
\v 29 Moses also had allotted some of the land \add on the east side of the Jordan
River\add* to half of the tribe of Manasseh. 
\v 30 Their land extended \add north\add* from Mahanaim \add city\add*. It included all the Bashan region, all the land that
King Og had ruled, and all the towns in the Jair area in Bashan. Altogether that area included sixty towns.
\v 31 Their area also included half of the Gilead region, and the cities of Ashtaroth and Edrei where King Og had ruled. All
that area was allotted to the clans descended from Manasseh's son Makir.
\p
\v 32 Moses had allotted to those tribes the land that was on the plain of the Moab
\add region\add*, on the east side of the Jordan \add River\add*, across from Jericho.
\v 33 But Moses did not allot any land to the tribe of Levi because Yahweh, the God whom we Israelis worship, promised that he
himself would always provide for them.
