\c 12  
\s A psalm written by David for the choir director 
\q
\v 1 Yahweh, help us! 
\q2 \add It seems that\add* people who are loyal to you have all vanished.
\q
\v 2 Everyone tells lies to other people; 
\q2 they deceive others by flattering them\f + \ft Or: saying good things about them that they know are not true \f*.
\b
\q
\v 3 Yahweh, we wish that you would cut off their tongues 
\q2 so that they cannot continue to boast. 
\q
\v 4 They say, “By telling lies we will get what we want; 
\q2 we control what we say \f + \ft metonymy \f*, so no one can tell us what we should not do!”
\b
\q
\v 5 But Yahweh replies, “I have seen the violent things that they have done to helpless people;
\q2 and I have heard those people groaning, 
\q2 so I will arise and rescue the people who are wanting me to help them.”
\b
\q
\v 6 Yahweh, you always do what you have promised to do; 
\q2 what you have promised is \add as precious and pure as\add* silver
\q2 that has been heated seven times in a furnace \add to get rid of all
the\add* impure material. 
\b
\q
\v 7-8 Wicked people strut around \add proudly\add*, 
\q2 and people praise them for doing vile\f + \ft Or: wicked \f* deeds, 
\q but Yahweh, \add we know that\add* you will protect\f + \ft Or: rescue \f* us
\q2 from those wicked people.
