\c 17  
\s A psalm written by David 
\q
\v 1 Yahweh, listen to me while I plead with you to act justly toward me.
\q2 Hear me while I call out to you to help me. 
\q Pay attention to what I say while I pray 
\q2 because I am speaking \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* honestly\f + \ft Or: truthfully \f*. 
\q
\v 2 You are the one who is able to declare that I ◄am innocent\f + \ft Or: have \f* not done anything that was wrong►
\q2 because you see\f + \ft Or: know \f* that I am telling the truth. 
\b
\q
\v 3 You know what I think, even at night; 
\q2 you have examined what I say and do, 
\q and you know that I have determined to never tell any lies. 
\q
\v 4 I have not done like others do; 
\q2 I have always done what is right [IDI], 
\q and I have not acted cruelly toward others. 
\q
\v 5 I have always done what you told me to do [IDI], 
\q2 I have ◄never failed to do\f + \ft Or: always \f* done► \\f + \\ft litotes \\f* those things. 
\b
\q
\v 6 O God, I pray to you because you answer me; 
\q2 please listen \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* to what I am saying. 
\q
\v 7 Show me that you faithfully love me. 
\q2 By your great power \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* rescue those who ◄run to\f + \ft Or: trust \f* in► you to protect them from their enemies.
\q
\v 8 Protect me as carefully as people protect their own eyes; 
\q2 protect me like \add birds\add* protect \add their babies\add* under their wings \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f*.
\q
\v 9 Do not allow wicked people to attack me; 
\q2 my enemies surround me, wanting to kill me. 
\b
\q
\v 10 They never pity [IDI] anyone, 
\q2 and they are always boasting. 
\q
\v 11 They have hunted\f + \ft Or: searched \f* for me and found me. 
\q2 They surround me, watching for an opportunity to throw me to the ground.
\q
\v 12 They are like lions \\f + \\ft simile \\f* that are ready to tear apart the animals that they capture;
\q2 They are like young lions that are hiding, waiting to pounce
\add on some animal\add*. 
\b
\q
\v 13 Yahweh, arise and ◄oppose\f + \ft Or: fight \f* against► my enemies and defeat them!
\q2 With your sword, save me from those wicked people! 
\q
\v 14 Yahweh, by your power \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* rescue me from those people who are interested
\add only\add* in things here in this world. 
\b
\q But you provide plenty of food for those whom you love dearly;
\q2 their children also have many things that their grandchildren will inherit.
\q
\v 15 Yahweh, because I act righteously, I will \add some day\add* see you \\f + \\ft synecdoche \\f*.
\q2 When I awake, I will see you face-to-face, and then I will be happy.
