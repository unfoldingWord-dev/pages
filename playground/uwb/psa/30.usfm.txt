\c 30  
\s A psalm written by David for the dedication of the temple 
\q
\v 1 Yahweh, I praise you because you rescued me. 
\q2 You did not allow \add me to die\add*, 
\q2 \add with the result that\add* my enemies could gloat\f + \ft Or: rejoice \f*.
\q
\v 2 Yahweh, my God, I called out for you to help \add me when I was
ill\add*, 
\q2 and you healed me. 
\q
\v 3 You saved\f + \ft Or: restored \f* me when I was dying \f + \ft metonymy \f*. 
\q2 I was nearly dead, 
\q2 but you caused me to become healthy again. 
\b
\q
\v 4 All you who belong to Yahweh, sing to praise him! 
\q2 Think about what God, the holy one, has done, and thank him!
\q
\v 5 When he becomes angry, he is angry for only a very short time \f + \ft hyperbole \f*,
\q2 but he is good to us all of our life. 
\q We may cry during the night, 
\q2 but the next morning we will be joyful. 
\b
\q
\v 6 As for me, when I had no troubles, I said \add to myself\add*,
\q2 "No one will defeat me!" 
\q
\v 7 Yahweh, because you were good to me, 
\q2 at first you caused me to be safe \add as though I was inside\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* a mountain.
\q But then \add I became ill, and I thought that\add* you had turned away from me,
\q2 and I became afraid. 
\b
\q
\v 8 Then I called out to you, 
\q2 and I pleaded for you to help me. 
\q
\v 9  \add I said\add*, "Yahweh, what will you gain if I die \f + \ft metonymy \f*?
\q In what way will it benefit you if I go to the place where the dead people are \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*?
\q Dead people are certainly not able to praise you \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*, 
\q2 and they are not able to tell others that you are trustworthy \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*!
\q
\v 10 Yahweh, listen to me, and act mercifully to me! 
\q2 Yahweh, help me!" 
\b
\q
\v 11 But \add now you have healed me\add*, and you have changed me from being sad to dancing
\add joyfully\add*. 
\q You have taken away the clothes that showed that I was very sad
\q2 and given me clothes that showed that I was very joyful. 
\q
\v 12 So I will not be silent; 
\q2 I will sing out loudly to praise you. 
\q Yahweh, you are my God, 
\q2 and I will thank you forever.
