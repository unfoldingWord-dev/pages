\c 110  
\s A psalm written by David 
\q
\v 1 Yahweh said to my lord \add the king\add*, 
\q “Sit here, close to me, in the place of highest honor \f + \fk metonymy \f* 
\q2 until I completely defeat your enemies \f + \fk metaphor \f* 
\q2 and make them like a stool for your feet!” 
\b
\q
\v 2 Yahweh \add said to him\add*, “I will extend your power as king
\q2 from Jerusalem \add to other lands\add*; 
\q2 you will rule over all your enemies. 
\q
\v 3 On the day that you lead your armies into battle, 
\q2 many of your people will volunteer \add to join your army\add*.
\q Like the dew refreshes the earth early in the morning, 
\q2 young men will \add encourage you by\add* coming to help you.”
\b
\q
\v 4 Yahweh has made a solemn promise, 
\q2 and he will never change his mind; 
\q he has said to the king, “You will be a priest forever 
\q2 like those who are in the line \add descended from\add* Melchizedek.”
\b
\q
\v 5 Yahweh stands at your right side; 
\q2 when he becomes angry, he will defeat many kings. 
\q
\v 6 He will judge and punish the people of many nations; 
\q2 he will fill the \add valleys\add* with their corpses. 
\q He will crush kings all over the earth. 
\q
\v 7 But the king will drink from the stream alongside the road;
\q2 he will be refreshed after defeating his enemies.
