\s A psalm written by Asaph 
\q
\v 1 God, why have you abandoned\f + \ft Or: rejected \f* us? 
\q2 Will you keep rejecting us forever \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*? 
\q Why are you angry with us, 
\q2 since we are like sheep in your pasture \add and you are like our
shepherd\add*? [MET, RHQ] 
\q
\v 2 Do not forget your people whom you chose long ago, 
\q2 the people whom you freed \add from being slaves in Egypt\add* and caused to become your tribe.
\q Do not forget Jerusalem, which was your home\f + \ft Or: where you dwelt \f*
\add on this earth\add*. 
\q
\v 3 Walk along \add and see\add* where everything has been totally ruined;
\q2 our enemies have destroyed everything in the sacred temple. 
\b
\q
\v 4 Your enemies shouted triumphantly in this sacred place; 
\q they erected their banners \add to show they had defeated us\add*.
\q
\v 5 They cut down all the \add engraved objects in the temple\add* like woodsmen cut down trees.
\q
\v 6 Then they smashed all the carved wood with their axes and hammers.
\q
\v 7 Then they burned your temple to the ground; 
\q2 they caused that place where you were worshiped to be unfit for people to worship in.
\q
\v 8 They said to themselves, “We will destroy the Israelis completely,”
\q2 and they also burned down all the other places where we gathered to worship God.
\q
\v 9 All our sacred symbols \f + \ft Or: miracles \f* are gone; 
\q2 there are no prophets now\f + \ft Or: anymore \f*, 
\q2 and no one knows how long \add this situation will continue\add*.
\b
\q
\v 10 God, how long will our enemies make fun of you \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*? 
\q Will they insult you \f + \ft metonymy \f* forever \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*? 
\q
\v 11 Why do you refuse to help [MTY, RHQ] us? 
\q2 Why do you keep your hand inside your cloak \add instead of using it to destroy our
enemies\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*? 
\b
\q
\v 12 God, you have been our king \add during all the years\add* since we came out of Egypt \f + \ft hyperbole \f*,
\q and you have enabled us to defeat \add our enemies\add* in the land
\add of Israel\add*. 
\q
\v 13 By your power you caused the \add Red\add* Sea to divide; 
\q2 \add it was as though\add* you smashed the heads of the \add rulers of Egypt who were
like\add* huge sea dragons \f + \ft metaphor \f*. 
\q
\v 14  \add It was as though\add* you crushed the head of the king of Egypt \f + \ft metaphor \f*
\q2 and gave his body to the animals in the desert to eat. 
\q
\v 15 You caused springs and streams to flow, 
\q2 and you also dried up rivers that had never dried up previously.
\q
\v 16 You created the days and the nights, 
\q2 and you put the sun and the moon in their places. 
\q
\v 17 You determined where the oceans end and the land begins, 
\q2 and you created the summer\f + \ft Or: hot \f* season and the winter\f + \ft Or: cold \f* season.
\b
\q
\v 18 Yahweh, do not forget that your enemies laugh at you, 
\q and that it is foolish people who despise you \f + \ft metonymy \f*. 
\q
\v 19 Do not abandon your helpless people \f + \ft metaphor \f* in the hands of their cruel enemies;
\q do not forget your suffering\f + \ft Or: persecuted \f* people. 
\q
\v 20 Continue thinking about\f + \ft Or: Do not forget \f* the agreement that you made with us;
\q2 Remember that there are violent people in every dark place on the earth.
\q
\v 21 Do not allow your oppressed people to be disgraced; 
\q2 help those poor and needy people in order that they will again praise you \f + \ft metonymy \f*.
\b
\q
\v 22 God, arise and defend yourself \add by defending your people\add*!
\q Do not forget that foolish people laugh at you all during the day\f + \ft Or: continually \f*!
\q
\v 23 Do not forget that your enemies shout angrily \add at you\add*;
\q2 the uproar that they make \add while they oppose you\add* never stops.
