\c 120  
\s A psalm written for people going up to the temple to worship 
\q
\v 1 When I was distressed\f + \ft Or: worried \f*, I called out to Yahweh 
\q2 and he answered me. 
\q
\v 2  \add I prayed\add*, 
\q2 “Yahweh, rescue\f + \ft Or: save \f* me from people [SYN, MTY] who lie to me and
\add try to\add* deceive me!” 
\b
\q
\v 3 You people who lie to me, \add I will tell you\add* \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* what
\add God\add* will do to you 
\q2 and what he will do to punish you. 
\q
\v 4 He will shoot sharp arrows at you like soldiers do, 
\q2 and he will \add burn you with\add* red-hot coals from \add the wood
of\add* a broom tree. 
\b
\q
\v 5 It is terrible for me, living among cruel\f + \ft Or: savage \f* \\f + \\ft doublet \\f* people
\q2 \add like those who live\add* in Meshech \add region\add* and Kedar
\add region\add*. 
\q
\v 6 I have lived for a long time among people who hate \add to live with
others\add* peacefully. 
\q
\v 7 Every time I talk about living together peacefully, 
\q2 they talk about starting a war.
