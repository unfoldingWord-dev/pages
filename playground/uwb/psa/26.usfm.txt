\c 26  
\s A psalm written by David 
\q
\v 1 Yahweh, show that I ◄am innocent\f + \ft Or: have \f* not done what is wrong►.
\q I always do what is right; 
\q2 I have trusted in you and never doubted \add that you would help
me\add*. 
\q
\v 2 Yahweh, examine what I have done and test me; 
\q2 thoroughly evaluate what I think in my inner being [IDI]. 
\q
\v 3 I never forget that you faithfully love me, 
\q2 I conduct my life according to your truth. 
\q
\v 4 I do not spend my time with liars 
\q2 and I stay away from hypocrites. 
\q
\v 5 I do not like to be with evil people, 
\q2 and I avoid wicked people 
\q
\v 6 Yahweh, I wash my hands to show that I ◄am innocent\f + \ft Or: have \f* not done what was wrong►.
\q As I join with others marching around your altar, 
\q
\v 7 we sing songs to say that we thank you, 
\q2 and we tell others the wonderful things that you \add have done\add*.
\q
\v 8 Yahweh, I love \add to be in\add* the temple where you live,
\q2 in the place where your glory appears. 
\b
\q
\v 9 Do not get rid of me like you get rid of sinners; 
\q2 do not cause me to die like you cause those who murder \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* people to die,
\q
\v 10 and people who \\f + \\ft synecdoche \\f* are ready to do wicked things 
\q2 and people who are always taking bribes. 
\q
\v 11 But as for me, I always try to do what is right. 
\q2 So act kindly toward me and rescue me. 
\b
\q
\v 12 I stand in places where I am safe, 
\q2 and when all your people gather together, I praise you.
