\c 124  
\s A psalm written by David for people going up to the temple to worship
\q
\v 1 You Israeli people, \add answer this question:\add* 
\q What \add would have happened to us\add* if Yahweh had not been helping\f + \ft Or: fighting for \f* us?
\q
\v 2 When \add our enemies\add* attacked us, 
\q if Yahweh had not been fighting for us, 
\q
\v 3 we would have all been killed [IDI] 
\q2 because they were very angry with us! 
\q
\v 4 They would have been like \f + \ft metaphor \f* a flood that swept\f + \ft Or: carried \f* us away;
\q \add it would have been as though\add* the water would have covered us,
\q2
\v 5 and we would all have drowned in the flood that was raging\f + \ft Or: flowing very fast \f*.
\b
\q
\v 6 But praise Yahweh 
\q2 because he has not allowed our \add enemies to destroy us\add*
\q2 \add like wild animals\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* tear apart \add the creatures that they
capture\add*. 
\q
\v 7 We have escaped \add from our enemies\add* like a bird escapes from the trap that hunters have set;
\q \add it is as though\add* the trap \add that our enemies set for
us\add* was broken 
\q2 and we have escaped from it! 
\q
\v 8 Yahweh is the one who helps us \f + \ft metonymy \f*; 
\q2 he is the one who made heaven and the earth.
