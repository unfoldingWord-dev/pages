\c 52  
\s A psalm written by David for the choir director, when Doeg went to Saul and said, “David has gone to talk with Ahimelech,
the supreme priest” 
\q
\v 1 You \add think that you\add* are strong 
\q2 and brag about the sins that you have committed, 
\q while you plan to harm godly people. 
\q
\v 2 All during the day you plan to get rid of others; 
\q what you say \f + \fr metonymy \f* \add injures others\add* like a sharp razor \f + \fr simile \f*,
\q2 and you are always deceiving others. 
\q
\v 3 You like \add doing what is\add* evil more than you like doing what is good,
\q2 and you like telling lies more than you like telling the truth.
\qr (Think about that!) 
\q
\v 4 You who say things \f + \fr metonymy \f* to deceive people, 
\q2 you like to say ◄things that hurt people/cruel things►! 
\b
\q
\v 5 But God will get rid of you forever; 
\q2 he will grab you and drag you from your home 
\q2 and take you away from this world where people are alive. 
\qr (Think about that!) 
\q
\v 6 When righteous people see that, they will be awestruck, 
\q2 and they will laugh at \add what happened to\add* you, and say,
\q
\v 7 “Look \add what happened to\add* the man who would not ask God to protect him;
\q2 he trusted that his great wealth \add would save him\add*; 
\q2 he trusted in the money that he got by wickedly taking it from others!”
\b
\q
\v 8 But I am \add secure/safe because I worship\add* in God's temple;
\q2 I am like a strong green olive tree. 
\q I trust in God, who faithfully loves us forever. 
\b
\q
\v 9 God, I will always thank you for the things that you have done.
\q2 As I stand before godly people, I will proclaim that you are good \f + \fr (OR, the many good \f + \fr metonymy \f*
\add things you have done for us\add*) \f*.
