\c 62  
\s A psalm written by David for Jeduthun, the choir leader 
\q
\v 1 God is the only one who can give me peace in my inner being,
\q2 and he is the one who saves me \add from my enemies\add*. 
\q
\v 2 Only he is like a huge rock \add under which I can be safe\add* \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f*;
\q2 he will be like a shelter, with the result that I will never be defeated \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f*.
\b
\q
\v 3 When will you, \add my enemies\add*, stop attacking me \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f*?
\q2 I feel that I am \add as useless against you as\add* a leaning wall or a broken-down fence \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f*.
\q
\v 4 My enemies plan to remove me from my important position so that people no longer honor me.
\q2 They delight in telling lies. 
\q They bless people by what they say \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f*, 
\q2 but in their inner beings they curse those people. 
\qr (Think about that!) 
\b
\q
\v 5 God is the only one who gives me peace in my inner being; 
\q2 he is the one whom I confidently expect \add to help me\add*.
\q
\v 6 Only he is like a huge rock \add under which I can be safe\add* \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f*;
\q2 he is like a shelter, and as a result I will never be defeated.
\q
\v 7 God is the one who saves me and honors me. 
\q2 He is like a huge strong rock under which I can find shelter \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f*.
\q
\v 8 You my people, always trust in him. 
\q2 Tell him all your troubles, 
\q2 because he is ◄our refuge\f + \ft Or: the \f* one who protects us► \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f*. 
\qr (Think about that!) 
\b
\q
\v 9 People who are considered to be unimportant are \add as unreliable
as\add* a breath of air; 
\q2 people who are considered to be important also really ◄amount to nothing\f + \ft Or: cannot \f* be trusted
\add to help us►\add*. 
\q If you put them all on a scale, \add it would be as if\add* they weighed less than a puff of air.
\q
\v 10 Do not trust in money gained by extorting it from others; 
\q2 do not try to gain anything by robbing others. 
\q If you become very wealthy, do not trust in [IDI] your money.
\b
\q
\v 11 I have heard God say more than once that he is the one who really has power,
\q
\v 12 and that he is the one who faithfully loves us. 
\q2 He rewards every one of us according to the deeds that we do.
