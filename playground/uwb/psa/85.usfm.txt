\v 2 You forgave us, your people, for the sins that we had committed;
\q2 you pardoned us for all our sins \\f + \\ft doublet \\f*. 
\qr (Think about that!) 
\q
\v 3 You stopped being angry with us

\v 7 Yahweh, by rescuing us \add from our troubles\f + \ft Or: difficulties \f*\add*,
\q2 show us that you faithfully love us.

\v 8 I want to listen to what Yahweh our God says,
