\q
\v 1 Yahweh, you have acted kindly toward \add us people who live
in\add* this land; 
\q you have enabled us Israeli people to become prosperous again.
\q
\v 2 You forgave us, your people, for the sins that we had committed;
\q2 you pardoned us for all our sins \f + \fr doublet \f*. 
\qr (Think about that!) 
\q
\v 3 You stopped being angry with us 
\q2 and turned away from severely punishing us. 
\b
\q
\v 4 Now, God, the one who saves/rescues us, ◄restore us/make us prosperous again►
\q and stop being angry with us! 
\q
\v 5 ◄Will you continue to be angry with us forever?/Please do not continue to be angry with us forever.► [DOU, RHQ]

us\add*. 
\q
\v 7 Yahweh, by rescuing us \add from our troubles/difficulties\add*,
\q2 show us that you faithfully love us. 
\b
\q
\v 8 I want to listen to what Yahweh our God says, 
\q2 because he promises/says that he will enable us, his people, to live peacefully,
\q2 if we do not return to doing foolish things. 
\q
\v 9 He is surely ready to save/rescue those who have an awesome respect for him,
\q2 in order that his glory/splendor will remain in our land. 
\b
\q
\v 10 When that happens, he will both faithfully love us and faithfully
\add do for us what he promised to do\add* \f + \fr personification \f*; 
\q and we will act/behave righteously, and he will give us peace,
\q2 which will be like a kiss that he gives us.

\v 11 Here on earth, we will ◄be loyal to/continually believe in► God,
\q and from heaven, God will act justly/fairly \add toward us\add*.
