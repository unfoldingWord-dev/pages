\c 22  
\s A psalm written by David for the choir director, to be sung to the tune 'Doe of the Dawn'
\q
\v 1 My God, my God, why have you abandoned\f + \ft Or: deserted \f* me? 
\q2 Why do you stay so far from me, 
\q2 and why do you not hear\f + \ft Or: help \f* me \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*? 
\q Why do you not hear me when I am groaning? 
\q
\v 2 My God, every day I call to you during the daytime, but you do not answer me.
\q2 I call to you during the night, but I am not able to rest\f + \ft Or: sleep \f*.
\b
\q
\v 3 But you are holy. 
\q2 You sit on your throne as king, and we the people of Israel praise you \f + \ft personification \f*.
\q
\v 4 Our ancestors trusted in you. 
\q \add Because\add* they trusted in you, you rescued them. 
\q
\v 5 When they cried out to you, you saved them. 
\q2 They trusted in you, and ◄they were not disappointed\f + \ft Or: you \f* \add saved
them\add* as you said that you would►. 
\b
\q
\v 6 But \add you have not rescued me\add*! 
\q2 \add People despise me and consider that I am not a man\add*;
\q2 \add they think that\add* I am a worm! 
\q Everyone \f + \ft hyperbole \f* scorns me and despises me. 
\q
\v 7 Everyone who sees me \f + \ft hyperbole \f* makes fun of me. 
\q2 They sneer at me and \add insult me by\add* shaking their heads
\add at me as though I were an evil man\add*. 
\q They say, 
\q
\v 8 “He trusts in Yahweh, 
\q2 so Yahweh should save him! 
\q \add He says that\add* Yahweh is very pleased with him; 
\q2 if that is so, Yahweh should rescue him!” 
\q
\v 9  \add Why do\add* you \add not\add* protect me \add now as you
did\add* when I was born? 
\q2 I was safe even when I was drinking milk from my mother's breasts\f + \ft Or: an infant \f*.
\q
\v 10  \add It was as though\add* you adopted me right when I was born.
\q2 You have been my God\f + \ft Or: taken care of me \f* ever since I was born.
\q
\v 11 So, do not stay far from\f + \ft Or: stay close to \f* \f + \ft litotes \f* me now 
\q2 because \add enemies who will cause me much\add* trouble are near me,
\q2 and there is no one \add else\add* who can help me. 
\b
\q
\v 12  \add My enemies\add* surround me \add like\add* a herd\f + \ft Or: group \f* of wild bulls.
\q2 \add Fierce people, like those\add* strong bulls that graze \add on the
hills\add* in Bashan \add area\add*, encircle me. 
\q
\v 13  \add They are like\add* roaring lions that are attacking the animals that they want to kill \f + \ft metaphor \f*
\add and eat\add*; 
\q2 they rush toward me \add to kill\add* me; 
\q they \add are like lions that\add* have their mouths open, \add ready to chew their victims to
pieces\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. 
\q
\v 14 I am completely exhausted \f + \ft metaphor \f*, 
\q2 and all my bones are out of their joints\f + \ft Or: places \f*. 
\q I \add no longer expect that God will save me\add*; 
\q2 \add that expectation is gone completely\add*, like wax that has melted away.
\q
\v 15 My strength is \add all dried up\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* 
\q2 like a broken piece of a clay jar that has dried \add in the
sun\add*. 
\q2 \add I am so thirsty that\add* my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth.
\q2 O God, \add I think that you are about to let\add* my body die and become dust!
\q
\v 16 My enemies \f + \ft metaphor \f* surround me like a pack\f + \ft Or: group \f* of wild dogs.
\q2 A group of evil men has encircled me, \add ready to attack me\add*.
\q2 They have already gnashed my hands and my feet. 
\q
\v 17  \add I am so weak and thin that\add* I can count all my bones.
\q2 My enemies stare at me and gloat\f + \ft Or: are happy \f* about \add what has happened
to\add* me. 
\q
\v 18 They looked at the clothes that I \add was wearing\add* 
\q2 and gambled to determine which piece each of them would get.
\b
\q
\v 19 O Yahweh, do not stay far away from me! 
\q2 You who are my \add source of\add* strength, 
\q come quickly and help me! 
\q
\v 20 Rescue me from \add those who want to kill me with\add* their swords.
\q2 Save my life from the power of those who are \add like wild\f + \ft Or: fierce \f*\add* dogs \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\q
\v 21 Snatch me away from \add my enemies who are\add* like lions whose jaws
\add are already open, ready to chew me up\add*! 
\q2 Grab me away from \add those men who are like\add* wild oxen
\add that attack other animals with\add* their horns \f + \ft metaphor \f*! 
\b
\q
\v 22  \add If you save me from them\add*, I will declare to my fellow Israelis how great you \f + \ft metonymy \f* are.
\q2 I will praise you among the group of your people \add gathered together to worship
you\add*. 
\q
\v 23 You people who have an awesome respect for Yahweh, praise him!
\q2 All you who are descended from Jacob, honor Yahweh! 
\q2 All you Israeli people, revere him! 
\q
\v 24 He does not despise or ignore those who are suffering; 
\q2 he does not hide his face\f + \ft Or: himself \f* from them. 
\q He has listened to them when they cried out to him for help. 
\b
\q
\v 25 Yahweh, in the great gathering \add of your people\add*, I will praise you for what you have done.
\q2 In the presence of those who have an awesome respect for you, I will offer
\add the sacrifices\add* that I promised. 
\q
\v 26 The poor people \add whom I have invited to the meal\add* will eat as much as they want.
\q2 All who come worship Yahweh will praise him. 
\q2 I pray that \add God will enable\add* you all to live a long and happy life!
\q
\v 27 I pray that \add people in all nations, even\add* in the remote areas, will think about Yahweh and turn to him,
\q2 and that people from all the clans in the world will bow down before him.
\q
\v 28 Because Yahweh is the king! 
\q2 He rules all the nations. 
\b
\q
\v 29 I desire that all the rich people on the earth will bow before him.
\q2 Some day they will die, 
\q2 but I want them to prostrate themselves on the ground in his presence
\add before they die\add*. 
\q
\v 30 People in the future generations\f + \ft Or: who have not been born yet \f* will also serve Yahweh.
\q2 Our descendants will be told about what Yahweh \add has done\add*.
\q
\v 31 People who are not yet born, \add who will live in future years\add*, will be told how Yahweh rescued his people.
\q2 People will tell them, “Yahweh did it!”
