\c 132  
\s A song to sing along the road up to Jerusalem 
\q
\v 1 Yahweh, do not forget \add king\add* David 
\q2 and all the hardships/troubles he endured! 
\b
\q
\v 2 He made a solemn promise to you, 
\q2 the mighty God whom \add our ancestor\add* Jacob \add worshiped\add*.
\q
\v 3 He said, “I will not go home, 
\q I will not \add rest\add* on my bed, 
\q
\v 4 I will not sleep at all 
\q
\v 5 until I build a place for Yahweh, 
\q2 a home for the mighty God whom Jacob \add worshiped\add*.” 
\b
\q
\v 6 In Bethlehem we heard news about the sacred chest. 
\q2 We \add went and\add* found it in the fields of Jearim \add city, and we took it to
Jerusalem\add*. 
\q
\v 7  \add Later we said\add*, “Let's go to the temple of Yahweh
\add in Jerusalem\add*; 
\q2 let's worship \add there\add* in front of the throne \add where he is
sitting\add*.” 
\q
\v 8 Yahweh, come to the place where you live eternally, 
\q2 to the place where your sacred chest is, 
\q2 to that place that shows that you are very powerful. 
\q
\v 9 I want/desire that the righteous behavior of your priests \add will always be
evident\add*, 
\q2 \add just like the beautiful\add* robes that they wear \f + \fr metaphor \f*,
\q and that your people will always shout joyfully. 
\b
\q
\v 10 You chose David to serve you \add as king of Israel\add*; 
\q2 do not reject/abandon him! 
\b
\q
\v 11 Yahweh, you made a solemn promise to David, 
\q2 a promise that you will not ◄break/take back►. 
\q You said, “I will cause your descendants to rule \f + \fr metonymy \f* as kings like you.
\q2
\v 12 If they obey my agreement with them 
\q2 and obey all the commands that I will give them, 
\q the line of kings descended from you will never end.” 
\b
\q
\v 13 Yahweh has chosen Jerusalem; 
\q he has wanted to make that city his home; 
\q
\v 14 he said, “This is the city where I will live forever \f + \fr doublet \f*;
\q2 this is the place where I wanted to stay. 
\q
\v 15 I will give to the people of Jerusalem all that they need;
\q2 I will give enough food even to satisfy the poor people there.
\q
\v 16 I will cause the priests \add to behave in a manner worthy
of\add* ones whom I have saved; 
\q2 \add that will be as evident as the beautiful\add* robes that they wear \f + \fr metaphor \f*;
\q2 and all my people who live there will shout joyfully. 
\b
\q
\v 17 There \add in Jerusalem\add* I will cause one of David's descendants \f + \fr metaphor \f* to become a great king;
\q2 he also will be my chosen king, 
\q and he will be like a \add bright\add* lamp \f + \fr metaphor \f* \add that shines
continually\add*. 
\q
\v 18 I will \add defeat his\add* enemies and cause them to be very ashamed/disgraced;
\q2 but the crown that my king wears will always shine.”
