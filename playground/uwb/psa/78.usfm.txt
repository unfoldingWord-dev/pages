\c 78  
\s A psalm written by Asaph 
\q
\v 1 My friends, listen to what I am going to teach you; 
\q2 pay careful attention [IDI] to what I say. 
\q
\v 2 I am going to give you some sayings that wise people have said.
\q2 They will be sayings about things that happened long ago, 
\q2 things that were difficult to understand \f + \ft metaphor \f*, 
\q
\v 3 things that we have heard and known previously, 
\q2 things that our parents and grandparents told us. 
\q
\v 4 We will tell these things to our children \f + \ft litotes \f*, 
\q but we will also tell to our grandchildren 
\q2 about Yahweh's power and the glorious\f + \ft Or: great \f* things that he has done.
\q
\v 5 He gave laws and commandments to the Israeli people, 
\q \add those who are the descendants of\add* Jacob \f + \ft doublet \f*, 
\q and he told our ancestors to teach them to their children 
\q
\v 6 in order that their children would also know them 
\q2 and then they would teach them to their children. 
\q
\v 7 In that way, they also would trust in God, 
\q2 and not forget the things that he has done; 
\q instead, they would obey his commandments. 
\q
\v 8 They would not be like their ancestors, 
\q2 who were very stubborn and kept rebelling \add against God\add*;
\q they did not continue firmly trusting in God, 
\q2 and they did not worship only him. 
\b
\q
\v 9  \add The soldiers of\add* the tribe of Ephraim had bows \add and
arrows\add* 
\q but they ran away \add from their enemies\add* on the day that they fought a battle with their enemies.
\q
\v 10 They did not do what they had agreed with God that they would do;
\q2 they refused to obey his laws. 
\q
\v 11 They forgot what he had done; 
\q2 they forgot about the miracles that they had seen him perform.
\q
\v 12 While our ancestors were watching, 
\q God performed miracles in the area around Zoan \add city\add* in Egypt.
\q
\v 13 Then he caused the \add Red\add* Sea to divide, 
\q2 causing the water \add on each side\add* to pile up like a wall,
\q2 with the result that \add our ancestors\add* walked through it
\add on dry ground\add*. 
\q
\v 14 He led them by a \add bright\add* cloud during the day 
\q and by a fiery light during the night. 
\q
\v 15 He split rocks open in the desert 
\q and gave to our ancestors plenty of water from deep inside the earth.
\q
\v 16 He caused a stream of water to flow from the rock; 
\q2 the water flowed like a river \f + \ft doublet \f*. 
\b
\q
\v 17 But \add our ancestors\add* continued to sin against God; 
\q in the desert they rebelled against the one who is greater than any other god.
\q
\v 18 By demanding that God give them the food that they desired,
\q they tried to find out if God would always do what they requested him to do.
\q
\v 19 They insulted God by saying, “Can God supply food for us \add here\add* in this desert?
\q
\v 20  \add It is true that\add* he struck the rock, 
\q2 with the result that water gushed\f + \ft Or: flowed \f* out, 
\q but ◄can he also provide bread and meat for us, his people?\f + \ft Or: we \f* doubt that he can also provide bread and meat for us, his
people.►” \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* 
\q
\v 21 So, when Yahweh heard that, he became very angry, 
\q2 and he sent a fire to burn up \add some of\add* his Israeli people. [MTY, DOU]
\q2
\v 22 He did that because they did not trust in him, 
\q2 and they did not believe that he would rescue them. 
\q
\v 23 But God spoke to the sky above them 
\q2 and commanded it to open like a door, 
\q
\v 24 and then \add food\add* fell down like rain, 
\q3 \add food which they named\add* 'manna'; 
\q2 God gave them grain from heaven\f + \ft Or: the sky \f*. 
\q
\v 25 So the people ate the food that angels eat, 
\q2 and God gave to them all the manna that they wanted. 
\q
\v 26  \add Later\add*, he caused the wind to blow from the east,
\q2 and by his power he also sent wind from the south, 
\q
\v 27 and the wind brought birds 
\q2 which were as numerous as the grains of sand on the seashore.
\q
\v 28 God caused those birds to fall in the middle of their camp\f + \ft Or: the area where they had put up their tents \f*,
\add and the birds died\add* \f + \ft Or: \add and the people grabbed them and killed
them\add*). 
\q2 \add There were birds\add* all around their tents. 
\q
\v 29 So the people \add cooked the birds and\add* ate the meat and their stomachs were full,
\q2 because God had given them what they wanted. 
\q
\v 30 But before they had eaten all that they wanted, 
\q2 and while they were still eating it, 
\q
\v 31 God was \add still\add* very angry with them, 
\q2 and he caused their strongest men to die; 
\q2 he got rid of \add many of\add* the finest young Israeli men.
\b
\q
\v 32 In spite of all this, the people continued to sin; 
\q in spite of all the miracles that God had performed, 
\q2 they still did not trust that he \add would take care of them\add*.
\q
\v 33 So, he caused their lives to end as quickly as a puff of wind ends;
\q2 they died when disasters suddenly struck them. 
\q
\v 34 When God caused \add some of\add* them to die, 
\q \add the others\add* turned to God; 
\q they repented and earnestly asked God \add to save them\add*.
\q
\v 35 They remembered that God is like a huge rock \add under which they would be
safe\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, 
\q and that he, who was greater than any other god, is the one who protected\f + \ft Or: rescued \f* them.
\q
\v 36 But they \add tried to\add* deceive God by what they said \f + \ft metonymy \f*;
\q2 their words \f + \ft metonymy \f* were all lies. 
\q
\v 37 They were not loyal to him; 
\q2 they disregarded\f + \ft Or: ignored \f* the agreement that he had made with them.
\q
\v 38 But God acted mercifully toward his people. 
\q He forgave them for having sinned 
\q2 and did not get rid of them. 
\q Many times he refrained from becoming angry \add with them\add*
\q and restrained himself from furiously\f + \ft Or: severely \f* \add punishing
them\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*. 
\q
\v 39 He remembered\f + \ft Or: considered \f* that they were only humans who die;
\q2 they \add disappear quickly\add* \f + \ft simile \f*, like a wind that blows by and then is gone.
\b
\q
\v 40 Many times our ancestors rebelled against God in the desert
\q and caused him to become very sad. 
\q
\v 41 Many times they did evil things, to find out \add if they could do those things without God punishing
them\add*. 
\q2 They frequently caused the holy God of Israel to become disgusted\f + \ft Or: sad \f*.
\q
\v 42 They forgot about his great power, 
\q2 and they forgot\f + \ft Or: did not think \f* about the time when he rescued them from their enemies.
\q
\v 43 They forgot about when he performed many miracles 
\q2 in the area near Zoan \add city\add* in Egypt. 
\q
\v 44 He caused the \add Nile\add* River (OR, their sources of water) to become
\add red like\add* blood, 
\q2 with the result that the people of Egypt had no water to drink.
\q
\v 45 He sent among the people of Egypt swarms of flies that bit them,
\q and he sent frogs that ate up everything. 
\q
\v 46 He sent locusts to eat their crops 
\q and the other things that grew in their fields. 
\q
\v 47 He sent hail that destroyed the grapevines, 
\q and sent frost that ruined the figs. 
\q
\v 48 He sent hail that killed their cattle 
\q and sent lightning that killed their sheep and cows. 
\q
\v 49 Because God was fiercely angry with the people of Egypt, 
\q he caused them to be very distressed. 
\q2 The disasters that struck them were like a group of angels that destroyed
\add everything\add*. 
\q
\v 50 He did not lessen his being angry with them, 
\q2 and he did not spare their lives\f + \ft Or: prevent them from dying \f*; 
\q he sent a plague\f + \ft Or: serious illness \f* that killed \add many of\add* them.
\q
\v 51 In that plague he caused all the firstborn sons of the people of Egypt to die.
\q
\v 52 Then he led his people out \add of Egypt\add* like \add a shepherd
leads\add* his sheep \f + \ft simile \f*, 
\q2 and he guided them \add while they walked\add* through the desert.
\q
\v 53 He led them safely, and they were not afraid, 
\q but their enemies were drowned in the sea. 
\q
\v 54 Later he brought them to \add Canaan\add*, his sacred land,
\q2 to \add Zion\add* Hill (OR, the hilly area) 
\q2 and by his power \f + \ft metonymy \f* he enabled them to conquer \add the people who were living
there\add*. 
\q
\v 55 He expelled the people-groups while his people were advancing;
\q2 he allotted part of the land for \add each tribe\add* to possess,
\q2 and he gave the houses of those people to the Israeli people.
\b
\q
\v 56 However, the Israeli people rebelled against God, who is greater than any other God,
\q2 and they did many evil things to see if they could do those things without God punishing them,
\q2 and they did not obey his commandments. 
\q
\v 57 Instead, like their ancestors did, they rebelled against God and ◄were not loyal to\f + \ft Or: did \f* not faithfully
\add obey\add*► him; 
\q2 they were as \add unreliable as\add* a crooked bow \add that does not shoot arrows
straight\add* \f + \ft simile \f*. 
\q
\v 58 Because they \add worshiped\add* carved images of their gods on the tops of hills,
\q they caused God to become angry \f + \ft doublet \f*. 
\q
\v 59 He saw what they were doing and became very angry, 
\q2 so he rejected the Israeli people. 
\q
\v 60 He no longer appeared to them at Shiloh 
\q2 in the tent where he had lived among them. 
\q
\v 61 He allowed their enemies to capture \add the sacred chest\add*,
\q2 \add which was the symbol of\add* his power and his glory. 
\q
\v 62 Because he was angry with his people, 
\q2 he allowed them to be killed \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add by their enemies\add*.
\q
\v 63 Young men were killed in battles, 
\q2 with the result that the young women had no one to marry. 
\q
\v 64 Many priests were killed by \add their enemies'\add* swords,
\q2 and the people did not allow the priests' widows\f + \ft Or: the priests' widows were not allowed \f* to mourn.
\b
\q
\v 65 Later, \add it was as though\add* the Lord awoke from sleeping;
\q he was like a strong man who became stimulated\f + \ft Or: felt that he was strong \f* by (OR, became sober after \f*
\add drinking\add* a lot of wine \f + \ft simile \f*. 
\q
\v 66 He pushed their enemies back 
\q and caused them to be very ashamed for a long time \f + \ft hyperbole \f* 
\q2 \add because they had been defeated\add*. 
\q
\v 67 But he did not set up his tent where the people of the tribe of Ephraim lived;
\q2 he did not choose their area to do that. 
\q
\v 68 Instead he chose the area where the tribe of Judah lived; 
\q2 he chose Zion Hill, which he loves. 
\q
\v 69 He \add decided\add* to have his temple built there, high up, like
\add his home in\add* heaven; 
\q he caused it to be firm, like the earth, 
\q2 \add and intended that\add* his temple would last forever. 
\q
\v 70 He chose David, who served him \add faithfully\add*, 
\q2 and took him from the pastures 
\q2
\v 71 where he was taking care of his \add father's\add* sheep, 
\q and appointed him to be the leader \f + \ft metaphor \f* of the Israeli people,
\q2 the people who belonged to God. 
\q
\v 72 David took care of the Israeli people sincerely and wholeheartedly,
\q2 and guided them skillfully\f + \ft Or: wisely \f*.
