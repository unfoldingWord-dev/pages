\s A psalm written for people going up to the temple to worship 
\q
\v 1 When Yahweh brought \add us Israeli people\add* back to Jerusalem \f + \ft (OR, enabled us Israelis to prosper again) \f*,
\q \add it was wonderful\add*; 
\q2 it seemed as though \\f + \\ft simile \\f* we were dreaming. 
\q
\v 2 We were extremely happy 
\q and we \\f + \\ft synecdoche \\f* continued shouting joyfully. 
\q Then the other people-groups said about us, 
\q2 “Yahweh has done great things for them!” 
\q
\v 3  \add And we say, “Yes\add*, Yahweh truly has done great things for us,
\q2 and we are very happy.” 
\b
\q
\v 4 But Yahweh, when it rains, water flows in the streams again
\add after they were dry\add* \\f + \\ft simile \\f*. 
\q2 Similarly, enable our nation to become great again like it was before.
\q
\v 5 We cried when we planted \add seeds because it was hard work preparing the soil that had not been plowed for many
years\add*; 
\q \add now we want to\add* shout joyfully because we are gathering a big harvest.
\q
\v 6 Those who cried as they carried the bags of seeds \add to the
fields\add* will shout joyfully 
\q2 when they bring the crops \add to their houses\add* at harvest time.
