\c 142  
\s A psalm that David prayed when he was hiding in a cave 
\q
\v 1 Yahweh, I cry out to you; 
\q2 I plead that you will help me. 
\q
\v 2 I am bringing to you all my problems; 
\q2 I am telling you all my troubles/difficulties. 
\q
\v 3 When I am very discouraged, 
\q2 you know what I should do. 
\b
\q Wherever I walk, \add it is as though\add* my enemies have hidden traps for me
\add to fall into\add*. 
\q
\v 4 I look around, 
\q2 but there is no one who sees me, 
\q2 no one who will protect me, 
\q2 no one who cares about \add what happens to\add* me. 
\b
\q
\v 5 So Yahweh, I cry out to you \add to help me\add*; 
\q2 you are the one who protects me; 
\q and you are all that I need while I am alive. 
\q
\v 6 Listen to me while I cry out to you for help 
\q2 because I am very distressed. 
\q Rescue/Save me from those who ◄persecute/cause trouble for► me,
\q2 because they are very strong, 
\q2 with the result that I cannot \add escape from them\add*. 
\q
\v 7 Free/Rescue me from my troubles/difficulties [MET] 
\q2 in order that I may thank you. 
\b
\q If you do that, when I am with godly/righteous people, 
\q2 \add I will praise you\add* for having been very good to me.
