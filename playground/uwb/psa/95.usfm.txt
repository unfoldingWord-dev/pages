\v 1 Come, sing to Yahweh; 
\q2 sing joyfully to the one who protects us [MET] and saves us!
\q
\v 2 We should thank him as we come before him, 
\q2 and sing ◄joyful songs/joyfully► as we praise him. 
\b
\q
\v 3 Because Yahweh is a great God, 
\q2 he is a great king \add who rules\add* over all \add other\add* gods.
\q
\v 4 He rules over the whole earth, 
\q2 from the deepest places/caves to the highest mountains. 
\q
\v 5 The seas are his, because he made them. 
\q2 He is the one who [SYN] also formed/made the dry land. 
\b
\q
\v 6 We should come, worship, and bow down before him. 
\q2 We should kneel before Yahweh, the one who made us. 
\q
\v 7 He is our God, 
\q2 and we are the people whom he takes care of [MET]; 
\q2 like sheep \add that a shepherd\add* takes care of. 
\b
\q I desire/pray that today you will hear what Yahweh is saying to you.
\q2
\v 8 He says, “Do not become stubborn [IDI] like your \add ancestors\add* did at Meribah,
\q2 and like they did at Massah in the desert. 
\q
\v 9 There your ancestors ◄wanted to see/tried to determine► if they could do many very evil things
\add without my punishing them\add*. 
\q2 Even though they had seen me perform \add many\add* miracles, they tested whether I
\add would continue to be patient with them\add*. 
\q
\v 10 For forty years I was angry with those people, 
\q2 and I said, ‘Those people ◄are fickle/say that they want to please me, but they do things that I detest►.
\q2 They refuse to obey my commands.’ 
\q
\v 11 So because I was very angry, I solemnly said/declared about them:
\q2 ‘They will never enter \add the land of Canaan\add* where I would have allowed them to rest!’ ”
