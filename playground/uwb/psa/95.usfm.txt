\v 1 Come, sing to Yahweh;

\q
\v 2 We should thank him as we come before him, 
\q2 and sing joyful songs\f + \ft Or: joyfully \f* as we praise him. 
\b
\q
\v 3 Because Yahweh is a great God, 
\q2 he is a great king \add who rules\add* over all \add other\add* gods.
\q
\v 4 He rules over the whole earth, 
\q2 from the deepest places\f + \ft Or: caves \f* to the highest mountains. 
\q
\v 5 The seas are his, because he made them. 
\q2 He is the one who \f + \ft synecdoche \f* also formed\f + \ft Or: made \f* the dry land.

\q
\v 6 We should come, worship, and bow down before him.

\v 7 He is our God,

\b
\q I desire\f + \ft Or: pray \f* that today you will hear what Yahweh is saying to you.
\q2
\v 8 He says, “Do not become stubborn [IDI] like your \add ancestors\add* did at Meribah,
\q2 and like they did at Massah in the desert. 
\q
\v 9 There your ancestors wanted to see\f + \ft Or: tried to determine \f* if they could do many very evil things
\add without my punishing them\add*. 
\q2 Even though they had seen me perform \add many\add* miracles, they tested whether I
\add would continue to be patient with them\add*. 
\q
\v 10 For forty years I was angry with those people, 
\q2 and I said, ‘Those people are fickle\f + \ft Or: say that they want to please me, but they do things that I detest \f*.
\q2 They refuse to obey my commands.’ 
\q
\v 11 So because I was very angry, I solemnly said\f + \ft Or: declared \f* about them:
\q2 ‘They will never enter \add the land of Canaan\add* where I would have allowed them to rest!’ ”
