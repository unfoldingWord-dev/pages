\c 24  
\s A psalm written by David 
\q
\v 1 The earth and everything in it belongs to Yahweh; 
\q2 all the people in the world belong to him, too, 
\q
\v 2 because he caused the ground to be above the water, 
\q2 above the water that was deep below the surface of the earth.
\b
\q
\v 3 Who will be allowed to go up on \add Zion\add* Hill \add in
Jerusalem\add*, 
\q2 in order to stand \add and worship\add* in Yahweh's holy temple?
\q
\v 4 Only those whose actions \f + \fk metonymy \f* and thoughts are pure, 
\q2 who have not worshiped idols, 
\q2 and who do not tell lies when they have solemnly promised \add to tell the
truth\add*. 
\q
\v 5 ◄They will be blessed by Yahweh/Yahweh will bless them►. 
\q When God \add judges them\add*, he who has saved them will say that they ◄have done nothing wrong/are without fault►.
\q
\v 6 They are the ones who approach God, 
\q2 they are the ones who may worship God, the one we Israelis worship.
\qr (Think about that!) 
\b
\q
\v 7 Open up the \add temple\add* gates 
\q2 in order that our glorious king may enter! 
\q
\v 8  \add Do you know\add* who the glorious king is? 
\q2 It is Yahweh, the one who is very strong \f + \fk doublet \f*; 
\q2 It is Yahweh, who conquers \add all his enemies\add* in battles!
\q
\v 9 Open up the \add temple\add* gates 
\q2 in order that our glorious king may enter! 
\q
\v 10  \add Do you know\add* who the glorious king is? 
\q2 It is Yahweh almighty; 
\q2 he is our glorious king! 
\qr (Think about that!)
