\c 11  
\s A psalm written by David for the choir director 
\q
\v 1 I trust that Yahweh will protect \f + \ft metonymy \f* me. 
\q2 So do not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* say to me, “You need to escape\f + \ft Or: flee \f* to the mountains like birds do,
\q
\v 2 because wicked people have hidden in the darkness, 
\q they have pulled back their bowstrings and aimed their arrows
\q2 to shoot them at godly\f + \ft Or: righteous \f* [IDI] people. 
\q
\v 3 When people are not punished for disobeying the laws, 
\q2 what can righteous people do?\f + \ft Or: there is not much that righteous people can do. \f*” \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\b
\q
\v 4 But Yahweh is sitting on his throne in his sacred temple in heaven,
\q2 and he \f + \ft synecdoche \f* watches everything that people do. 
\q
\v 5 Yahweh examines what righteous people do and what wicked people do,
\q2 and he hates those who like to perform violent actions \add to injure
others\add*. 
\q
\v 6 He will send down \add from the sky\add* flaming coals and burning sulfur,
\q2 and send scorching hot winds to punish the wicked people. 
\b
\q
\v 7 Yahweh is righteous and he loves those who act righteously;
\q2 righteous people are able to come into his presence.
