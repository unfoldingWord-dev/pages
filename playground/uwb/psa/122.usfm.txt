\c 122  
\s A psalm written by David for people going up to the temple to worship
\q
\v 1 I was glad\f + \ft Or: happy \f* when people said to me, 
\q2 "We should go to the temple of Yahweh \add in Jerusalem\add*!"
\q
\v 2 And now we are here, 
\q2 standing inside the gates\f + \ft Or: city \f* of \f + \ft apostrophe \f* Jerusalem. 
\q
\v 3 Jerusalem is a city that has been rebuilt, 
\q2 with the result that people can gather together in it. 
\q
\v 4 We \add people of the\add* tribes of Israel who belong to Yahweh can now go up there
\q2 as Yahweh commanded that we should do, 
\q2 and we can thank him. 
\q
\v 5 There the kings of Israel who were descendants of King David sat on their thrones
\q2 and decided cases \add fairly when the people had disputes\add*.
\b
\q
\v 6 Pray that there will be peace in Jerusalem; 
\q I wish\f + \ft Or: hope \f* that those who love Jerusalem will prosper\f + \ft Or: live peacefully \f*.
\q
\v 7 I hope\f + \ft Or: wish \f* that there will be peace inside the walls of the city
\q2 and that people who are inside the palaces will be safe. 
\q
\v 8 For the sake of my relatives and friends I say, 
\q2 "I wish\f + \ft Or: hope \f* that inside Jerusalem people will live peacefully."
\q
\v 9 And because I love the temple of Yahweh our God, 
\q2 I pray that things will go well for the people who live \add in
Jerusalem\add*.
