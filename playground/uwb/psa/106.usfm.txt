\c 106  
\q
\v 1 Praise Yahweh! 
\q Praise Yahweh, because he does good things \add for us\add*; 
\q2 he faithfully loves us forever/continually! 
\q
\v 2  \add Because Yahweh has done many great things\add*, 
\q2 no one can \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* tell all the great things that Yahweh has done,
\q2 and no one can praise him enough/sufficiently. 
\q
\v 3 ◄Happy are/He is pleased with► those who act fairly/justly,
\q2 with those who always do what is right. 
\q
\v 4 Yahweh, be kind to me when you help your people; 
\q2 help me when you rescue/save them. 
\q
\v 5 Allow me to see it when your people become prosperous again
\q2 and when all the people of your nation, \add Israel\add*, are happy;
\q2 allow me to be happy with them! 
\q2 I want to praise you along with all those \add others\add* who belong to you.
\b
\q
\v 6 We and our ancestors have sinned; 
\q2 we have done what is wicked and what is evil \f + \fk doublet \f*. 
\q
\v 7 When our ancestors were in Egypt, 
\q2 they did not pay attention to the wonderful things that Yahweh did;
\q2 they forgot about the many times that he showed that he faithfully loved them.
\q Instead, when they were at the Red Sea, 
\q2 they rebelled against God, who is greater than any other god.
\q
\v 8 But he rescued them for the sake of his own \add reputation\add*
\q2 in order that he could show that he is very powerful. 
\q
\v 9 He rebuked the Red Sea and it became dry, 
\q2 and then while he led our ancestors, 
\q2 they walked through it as though it were as dry as a desert \f + \fk simile \f*.
\q
\v 10 In that way he rescued them from the power \f + \fk metonymy \f* of their enemies who hated them \f + \fk doublet \f*.
\q
\v 11 Then their enemies were drowned in the water \add of the Red
Sea\add*; 
\q2 not one of them was left. 
\q
\v 12 When that happened, our ancestors believed \add that Yahweh had truly done for them what he
had\add* promised to do, 
\q2 and they sang to praise him. 
\b
\q
\v 13 But they soon forgot when he had done for them; 
\q2 they \add did things\add* without waiting to find out what Yahweh wanted them to do.
\q
\v 14 They intensely wanted \add food like they formerly ate in Egypt\add*.
\q2 They \add did evil things to\add* find out \add if they could do those things without God punishing
them\add*. 
\q
\v 15 So he gave them what they requested, 
\q2 but he also caused a terrible disease to afflict them. 
\b
\q
\v 16  \add Later\add* when \add some of\add* the men became jealous of Moses
\q and \add his older brother\add* Aaron, who was dedicated \add to serve Yahweh by being a
priest\add*, 
\q
\v 17 the ground opened up and swallowed Dathan 
\q2 and also buried Abiram and his family. 
\q
\v 18 And \add God sent\add* a fire down \add from heaven\add* 
\q2 which burned up all the wicked people who ◄supported them/agreed with► them.
\b
\q
\v 19 Then the \add Israeli leaders\add* made a gold \add statue of
a\add* calf at Sinai \add Mountain\add* 
\q2 and worshiped it. 
\q
\v 20 Instead of worshiping our glorious God, 
\q2 they started to worship a statue of an ox that eats grass! 
\q
\v 21 They forgot about God, who had rescued them by the great miracles that he performed in Egypt.
\q
\v 22 They forgot about the wonderful things that he did for them in Egypt
\q2 and the amazing/awesome things that he did for them at the Red Sea.
\q
\v 23 Because of that, God said that he would get rid of the Israelis,
\q2 but Moses, whom God had chosen \add to serve him\add*, stood up to persuade God
\add not to get rid of them\add*. 
\q2 And as a result God did not destroy them. 
\b
\q
\v 24  \add Later\add*, our ancestors ◄refused/were afraid► to enter beautiful
\add Canaan\add* land 
\q2 because they did not believe \add that God would enable them to take the land from the people who were living there
as\add* he had promised. 
\q
\v 25 They stayed in their tents and grumbled 
\q2 and would not pay attention to what Yahweh said that they should do.
\q
\v 26 So he solemnly \f + \fk metonymy \f* told them 
\q2 that he would cause them to die there in the desert, 
\q2
\v 27 and that he would scatter their descendants among the \add people
of\add* other nations/people-groups \add who did not believe in him\add*,
\q2 and that he would allow them to die in those lands. 
\b
\q
\v 28 Later the Israeli people started to worship \add the idol of\add* Baal
\add who they thought lived\add* at Peor \add Mountain\add*, 
\q and they ate \add meat that had been\add* sacrificed to \add Baal and those
other\add* lifeless gods. 
\q
\v 29 Yahweh became very angry because of what they had done, 
\q2 so \add again\add* he sent a terrible disease to attack/strike them.
\q
\v 30 But Phinehas stood up and punished/killed \add the ones who had sinned
greatly\add*, 
\q2 and as a result the ◄plague/serious disease► ended. 
\q
\v 31 People have remembered that righteous deed that Phinehas did,
\q2 and in future years people will remember it. 
\b
\q
\v 32 Then at Meribah Springs our ancestors caused Yahweh to become angry,
\q2 and as a result Moses had trouble. 
\q
\v 33 They caused Moses to become very angry [IDI], 
\q2 and he said things that were foolish. 
\b
\q
\v 34 Our ancestors did not destroy the people \add who did not believe in
Yahweh\add* 
\q2 like he told them to do. 
\q
\v 35 Instead, the men took women from those people-groups, 
\q2 and they started to do the evil things that those people did.
\q
\v 36 Our ancestors worshiped the idols of those people, 
\q2 which resulted in their being destroyed/exiled/taken to another country \f + \fk metaphor \f*.
\q
\v 37  \add Some of\add* the Israelis sacrificed their sons and daughters to the demons
\add that those idols represented\add*. 
\q
\v 38 They killed \f + \fk metonymy \f* their own children, who ◄were innocent/had not things that were wrong►,
\q and offered them as sacrifices to the idols in Canaan. 
\q2 As a result, Canaan land was polluted by those murders \f + \fk metonymy \f*.
\q
\v 39 So by their deeds they caused themselves to become unacceptable to God;
\q2 \add because they did not faithfully worship only God\add*, 
\q2 \add they became like\add* women who sleep with other men \add instead of sleeping only with their
husbands\add* \f + \fk metaphor \f*. 
\b
\q
\v 40 So Yahweh became very angry with his people; 
\q2 he was completely disgusted with them. 
\q
\v 41 As a result he allowed people-groups \add who did not believe in
him\add* to conquer them, 
\q2 so those who hated our ancestors started to rule over them. 
\q
\v 42 Their enemies ◄oppressed them/treated them cruelly► 
\q2 and caused them to be completely controlled by their enemies \f + \fk metaphor \f*.
\q
\v 43 Many times Yahweh rescued them, 
\q2 but they continued to rebel against him, 
\q2 and they were finally destroyed because of the sins that they committed.
\b
\q
\v 44 However, Yahweh \add always\add* heard them when they cried out to him,
\q2 and he listened to them when they were distressed. 
\q
\v 45 For their sake, he thought about the agreement/promise that he had made
\add to bless\add* them, 
\q2 and because he never stopped loving them very much, 
\q2 he changed his mind \add about punishing them more\add*. 
\q
\v 46 He caused all those who had taken the Israelis \add to Babylonia\add* to ◄feel sorry for/pity► them.
\b
\q
\v 47 Yahweh our God, rescue/save us 
\q and bring us back \add to Israel\add* from among those people-groups
\q2 in order that we may thank you \f + \fk metonymy \f* 
\q2 and joyfully praise you. 
\b
\q
\v 48 Praise Yahweh, the God whom we Israelis \add worship\add*,
\q praise him now and forever! 
\b
\q And I wish/desire that everyone say, “Amen/May it be so!” 
\q2 Praise Yahweh!
