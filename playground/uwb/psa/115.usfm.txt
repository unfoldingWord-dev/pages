\q
\v 2 It is not right that \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* other people-groups should say about us,
\q "\add They claim that\add* their God \add is very powerful\add*,
\q2 but \add if that is true\add*, why does he not \add help them\add*?"
\q
\v 3 Our God is in heaven, 
\q2 and he does whatever he wants to! 
\q
\v 4 But their idols are only \add statues made of\add* silver and gold,

\v 6 They have ears, but they cannot hear \add anything\add*; 
\q2 they have noses, but they cannot smell \add anything\add*. 
\q
\v 7 They have hands, but they cannot feel \add anything\add*; 
\q2 they have feet, but they cannot walk, 
\q2 and they cannot even make any sounds in their throats! 
\q
\v 8 The people who make those idols are \add as powerless\add* as those idols,
\q2 and those who trust in those idols \add can accomplish nothing\add*, just like their idols!
\b
\q
\v 9 You, \add my fellow\add* Israeli people, trust in Yahweh! 
\q2 He is the one who helps you and \add protects you like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* a shield.
\q
\v 10 You priests \f + \ft metonymy \f*, trust in Yahweh!

\b
\q
\v 14 I wish\f + \ft Or: hope \f* that Yahweh will give many children 
\q2 to you \add my fellow-Israeli people\add*, and to your descendants.
\q
\v 15 I wish\f + \ft Or: hope \f* that Yahweh, the one who made heaven and the earth, will bless all of you!

\v 16 The highest heavens belong to Yahweh, 
\q2 but he gave \add everything that is on\add* the earth to us people.
\q
\v 17 Dead people are not \add able to\add* praise Yahweh; 
\q2 when they descend into the place where dead people are, 
\q2 they are unable to speak and cannot praise him. 
\q
\v 18 But we \add who are alive\add* will thank\f + \ft Or: praise \f* him, 
\q2 now and forever. 
\b
\q Praise Yahweh!
