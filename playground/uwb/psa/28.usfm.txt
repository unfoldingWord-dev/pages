\c 28  
\s A psalm written by David 
\q
\v 1 Yahweh, I call out to you; 
\q You are like a huge rock \add under which I can hide\add*. 
\q Do not refuse to answer me, 
\q2 because if you are silent, I will soon be with those who are in their graves.
\q
\v 2 Listen to me when I call out for you \add to help me\add*, 
\q2 when I lift up my hands as I face your sacred temple. 
\b
\q
\v 3 Do not drag me away with wicked people, 
\q2 with those who do wicked deeds, 
\q with those who pretend \add to act\add* peacefully toward others
\q2 while in their inner beings, they hate them. 
\q
\v 4 Punish those people in the way that they deserve for what they have done;
\q2 punish them for their evil deeds \f + \fk doublet \f*. 
\q
\v 5 Yahweh, they do not pay attention to the \add wonderful\add* things that you have done and that you have created;
\q2 so get rid of them permanently and do not let them appear again!
\b
\q
\v 6 Praise Yahweh 
\q2 because he has heard me when I called out for him to help me!
\q
\v 7 Yahweh makes me strong and protects me \add like a shield\add* \f + \fk metaphor \f*;
\q2 I trusted in him, and he helped me. 
\q I was glad in my inner being, 
\q2 and from my inner being I praised him as I sang to him. 
\b
\q
\v 8 Yahweh causes us to me strong and protects us; 
\q2 and he saves me, the one he appointed \f + \fk metonymy \f* to be king. 
\q
\v 9 Yahweh, save/rescue your people; 
\q2 bless those who belong to you. 
\q \add Take care of them like\add* a shepherd \add takes care of his
sheep\add* \f + \fk metaphor \f*; 
\q2 take care of them forever.
