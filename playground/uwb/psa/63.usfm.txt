\c 63  
\s A psalm written by David when he was in the desert in Judea 
\q
\v 1 God, you are the God whom I \add worship\add*. 
\q I greatly desire to be with you 
\q2 like [SIL] a person in a dry hot desert greatly desires \add some
water\add*. 
\b
\q
\v 2 So, I want to see you in your temple; 
\q I want to see that you are great and glorious. 
\q
\v 3 Your constantly loving us is ◄worth more/more precious► than my life,
\q2 so I \f + \fr metonymy \f* will \add always\add* praise you. 
\q
\v 4 I will praise you all the time that I live; 
\q2 I will lift up my hands to you while I pray. 
\q
\v 5  \add Knowing you satisfies me more than\add* [IDI, MET] eating a very big feast,
\q2 so I will praise you while I sing \f + \fr metonymy \f* joyful songs. 
\b
\q
\v 6 While I lie on my bed, I think about you. 
\q I think/meditate about you all during the night, 
\q
\v 7 because you have always helped me, 
\q2 and I sing joyfully knowing that I am protected by you 
\q2 \add as a little bird is protected\add* under \add its mother's\add* wings \f + \fr metaphor \f*.
\q
\v 8 I cling to you; 
\q2 and your hand/power protects me. 
\b
\q
\v 9 But those who are trying to kill me 
\q2 will \add die and\add* descend into the place of the dead; 
\q
\v 10 they will be killed in battles \f + \fr metonymy \f* 
\q2 and their \add corpses\add* will be eaten by jackals/wild dogs.
\b
\q
\v 11 But I, the king \add of Israel\add*, will rejoice in what God has done;
\q2 and all those who ask God \f + \fr metonymy \f* to curse them if they do not do what they solemnly promise will praise him,
\q2 but he will not allow liars to say anything.
