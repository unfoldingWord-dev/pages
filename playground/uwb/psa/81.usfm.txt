\c 81  
\s A psalm written by Asaph for the choir director 
\q
\v 1 Sing songs to praise God, who enables us to be strong \add when we fight our
enemies\add*; 
\q shout joyfully to God, whom we ◄descendants of Jacob\f + \ft Or: Israeli \f* people►
\add worship\add*! 
\q
\v 2 Start \add playing\add* the music, and beat the tambourines,
\q2 and play nice music on the harps and ◄lyres\f + \ft Or: other \f* stringed instruments►.
\b
\q
\v 3 Blow the trumpets \add during the festival to celebrate\add* each new moon
\q2 and each time the moon is full and during our \add other\add* festivals.
\q
\v 4 Do that because that is a law for us Israeli people; 
\q2 it is a command that God made for the descendants of Jacob. 
\q2
\v 5 He gave it to the Israeli people when he punished the people of Egypt land.
\b
\q I heard someone \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* whose voice I did not recognize, saying,
\q
\v 6 “\add After the rulers of Egypt forced you Israelis to work as
slaves\add*, 
\q I took those \add heavy\add* burdens off your backs, 
\q2 and I enabled you to lay down those heavy baskets \add of bricks that you were
carrying\add*. 
\q
\v 7 When you were greatly distressed, you called out to me, and I rescued you;
\q2 I answered you out of a thundercloud. 
\q2 \add Later\add* I tested \add whether you would trust me to give
you\add* water \add when you were in the desert\add* at Meribah.
\qr (Think about that!) 
\q
\v 8 You who are my people, listen while I warn you! 
\q I wish that you Israeli people would pay attention to what I \add say to
you\add*! 
\q
\v 9 You must not have any idols of other gods among you; 
\q2 you must never bow to worship any of them! 
\q
\v 10 I am Yahweh, your God; 
\q2 It was \add not any of those gods\add* who brought you out of Egypt,
\q I am the one who did it! 
\q2 So request what you want me to do for you \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f*, and I will do it.
\b
\q
\v 11 But my people would not listen to me \\f + \\ft synecdoche \\f*; 
\q2 they would not obey me. 
\q
\v 12 So because they were very stubborn, 
\q2 and I allowed them to do whatever they wanted to do. 
\b
\q
\v 13 I wish that my people would listen to me, 
\q that the Israeli people would behave as I want them to do. 
\q
\v 14  \add If they did that\add*, I would quickly defeat their enemies;
\q2 I would strike\f + \ft Or: punish \f* all of them \\f + \\ft doublet \\f*. 
\q
\v 15 Then all those who hate me would ◄cringe before\f + \ft Or: bow \f* down to► me,
\q2 and then I would punish them \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* forever. 
\q
\v 16 But I would give you \add Israelis\add* very good wheat\f + \ft Or: grain \f*,
\q2 and I would fill your stomachs with wild honey.”
