\s A psalm written by David for people going up to the temple to worship
\q
\v 1 Yahweh, I am not proud 
\q2 and I have not thought highly about ◄myself\f + \ft Or: the \f* things that I have done►.
\q And I do not worry about things \add that you have done\add* that are very big or very wonderful.
\q
\v 2 Instead, I am calm and peaceful in my inner being, 
\q2 like a small child who lies quietly at its mother's breast \\f + \\ft simile \\f*.
\q2 In the same way, I am peaceful within my inner being. 
\b
\q
\v 3 You my fellow Israelis, confidently expect that Yahweh \add will do good things for
you\add*, 
\q2 now and forever!
