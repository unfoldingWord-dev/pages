\c 39  
\s A psalm written by David for Jeduthun, the choir director 
\q
\v 1 I said \add to myself\add*, “I will be careful not to sin by the things that I say \f + \ft metonymy \f*.
\q I will not say anything \add to complain to you\add* 
\q2 while wicked people are near to me \add and can hear me\add*.”
\q
\v 2 So I was completely silent \f + \ft doublet \f*, and I did not even talk about things that were good,
\q2 but it was useless because I began to suffer even more. 
\q
\v 3 I became very anxious\f + \ft Or: worried \f* [IDI] in my inner being. 
\q2 As I thought \add about my troubles\add*, I became more worried.
\q2 Then finally I said \f + \ft metonymy \f*, 
\b
\q
\v 4 “Yahweh, show\f + \ft Or: tell \f* me how long I will live. 
\q2 Tell me when I will die. 
\q2 Tell me how many years I will live! 
\q
\v 5  \add It seems that\add* you have caused me to live only a short time;
\q2 my lifetime\f + \ft Or: all the time that I have lived \f* seems nothing to you.
\q2 The time that all we humans live is \add as short as\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* a puff of wind.
\qr (Think about that!) 
\q
\v 6 Then we disappear like a shadow does. 
\q2 It seems that all that we do is for nothing\f + \ft Or: useless \f*. 
\q2 We \add sometimes\add* get a lot of money, but we do not know who will get it
\add after we die\add*. 
\q
\v 7 So now, Yahweh, if I expect \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add to receive blessings from other
people\add*, I will be disappointed. 
\q2 You are the \add only\add* one from whom I confidently expect
\add to receive blessings\add*. 
\q
\v 8 Save me from \add being punished for\add* all the sins that I have committed.
\q2 And do not allow foolish people to make fun of me. 
\q
\v 9 I did not say anything \add when you punished me\add*, 
\q2 because \add I knew that\add* you were the one who caused \add me to
suffer\add*. 
\q
\v 10 But now, please stop punishing me! 
\q2 \add If you do not do that\add*, I am about to die because of the ways that you \f + \ft synecdoche \f* have struck\f + \ft Or: afflicted \f* me.
\q
\v 11 When you rebuke someone and punish him for the sin that he has committed,
\q2 you destroy the things that he loves\f + \ft Or: are precious to him \f*, like moths'
\add larva\add* destroy clothing. 
\q2 Our lives disappear like a puff of wind. 
\qr (Think about that!) 
\b
\q
\v 12 Yahweh, listen to me while I pray; 
\q2 pay attention to me while I cry out to you. 
\q2 Help me while I am crying. 
\q I am here on the earth for only a short time, 
\q2 like all my ancestors. 
\q
\v 13 Now please allow me to be alone \add and do not punish me anymore\add*
\q2 in order that I may smile and be happy for a while before I die. \f + \ft euphemism, doublet \f*”
