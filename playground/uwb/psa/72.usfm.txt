\d A psalm written by Solomon 
\s A prayer for God to bless the king 
\q
\v 1 O God, enable the king \add whom you appointed in Israel\add* to rule justly.
\q2 Show/Teach him how to judge matters fairly 
\q
\v 2 in order that he will judge your people fairly, 
\q2 that he will govern your oppressed people justly. 
\q
\v 3 I desire that \add all over the country\add*—even on the hills and mountains \f + \fk doublet \f*—
\q2 people will live peacefully and righteously. 
\q
\v 4 Help your king to defend the poor people 
\q2 and to rescue needy people and to defeat those who oppress them.
\b
\q
\v 5 I desire that your king will live \f + \ft (OR, that your people will worship you) \f* as long as the sun shines,
\q2 as long as the moon shines, \add forever\add*. 
\q
\v 6 I desire that his rule will \add be enjoyed by the people\add* \f + \fk simile \f*
\q2 like \add they enjoy\add* rain on the growing crops, 
\q2 like \add they enjoy\add* the showers that fall on the land.
\q
\v 7 I hope/desire that people will live righteously during the years that he rules,
\q2 and that the people will live peacefully and prosperously as long as the moon shines.
\b
\q
\v 8 I hope/desire that the king \add of Israel\add* will rule \add the
people\add* 
\q2 in all the area from one sea \add in the east\add* to another
\add in the west\add*, 
\q2 and from the \add Euphrates\add* River to the most remote/distant places on earth.
\q
\v 9 I hope/desire that those who live in the desert will bow down before him,
\q2 and that his enemies will throw themselves on the ground \add in
submission\add* to our king. 
\q
\v 10 I hope/desire that the kings of Spain and of the islands \add in the Mediterranean
Sea\add* will bring ◄tribute money/taxes► to the king \add of Israel\add*,
\q2 and that the kings of Sheba \add to the south\add* and of Seba
\add to the southwest\add* will bring him gifts. 
\q
\v 11 I hope/desire that all the \add other\add* kings \add in the
world\add* will bow before the king \add of Israel\add*, 
\q2 and that \add people of\add* all nations will serve our king.
\b
\q
\v 12 He rescues poor people when they ◄cry out/plead► for help,
\q2 and he helps those who are needy and those who have no one to help them.
\q
\v 13 He pities those who are weak and needy; 
\q2 he saves the people's lives. 
\q
\v 14 Our king will rescue the people from being oppressed and from being treated cruelly,
\q2 because ◄their lives/they► \f + \fk metonymy \f* are precious to our king. 
\b
\q
\v 15 I hope/desire that our king will live a long time!

\q I desire that people will always pray for our king 
\q2 and praise him all the time, \add every day\add*. 
\q
\v 16 I hope/desire that the fields will produce plenty of grain
\add everywhere, even\add* on the tops of the hills in the land where he rules,
\q2 like the grain that grows on the hills in Lebanon. 
\q I hope/desire that the cities \add in Israel\add* will be full of people
\q2 like the fields are full of grass. 
\q
\v 17 I desire that the name of the king will never be forgotten.
\q2 I hope/desire that people will remember him as long as the sun shines.
\b
\q I hope/desire that people of all nations will ask ◄God to bless them/that they will be blessed by God►
\q2 just like he has blessed the king \add of Israel\add*. 
\q
\v 18 Praise Yahweh, the God whom we Israelis worship; 
\q2 he is the only one who does wonderful things. 
\q
\v 19 Praise him forever! 
\q2 I desire that ◄his glory will fill the whole world/people all over the world may see that he is very great► \f + \fk metonymy \f*!
\q2 Amen! May it be so!
