\s A psalm written for people going up to the temple to worship 
\q
\v 1 Those/We who trust in Yahweh are \add as secure/steadfast\add* \f + \fk simile \f* as Zion Hill,
\q2 which cannot be shaken and can never be moved. 
\q
\v 2 Like the hills that surround Jerusalem \add protect the city\add*,
\q2 Yahweh protects us, his people, 
\q2 and he will protect us forever. 
\b
\q
\v 3 Wicked people \f + \fk metonymy \f* should not \add be allowed to\add* rule over the land where righteous people live.
\q2 If they did that, those righteous people might \add ◄be encouraged to imitate them
and\add*► do things that are wrong. 
\b
\q
\v 4 Yahweh, do good things to those who do good things to others
\q2 and to those who sincerely obey your commands [IDI]. 
\q
\v 5 But when you punish the wicked people \add who are not Israelis\add*,
\q2 also punish those \add Israelis\add* who turn away from walking on the good roads that you have shown them!
\b
\q I wish that things will go well for people in Israel!
