\q
\v 1 I praise Yahweh, who is like a huge rock \add under which I\add*
\add get refuge\f + \ft Or: am protected\add* \f*! 
\q He trains my hands so that I can use them to fight battles; 
\q2 he trains my fingers so that I can \add shoot arrows in a war\add*.
\q
\v 2 He is the one who protects me; 
\q2 he is like a fortress \f + \ft doublet \f* in which I am safe, 
\q2 he protects me like shields \add protect soldiers\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*,
\q2 and he gives me refuge. 
\q He defeats other nations and then puts them under my power. 
\b
\q
\v 3 Yahweh, we people are \add very insignificant\f + \ft Or: unimportant \f*\add*, so why are you concerned\f + \ft Or: do you care about us \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*?
\q \add It is amazing to me that\add* you pay attention to humans.
\q
\v 4  \add The time that we live is as short\add* as \f + \ft simile \f* a puff of wind;
\q2 our time to live disappears like a shadow does. 
\b
\q
\v 5 Yahweh, tear open\f + \ft Or: open up \f* the sky and come down!

\v 6 Cause lightning to flash with the result that your enemies will run away!
\q2 Shoot your arrows at them and cause them to run away\f + \ft Or: scatter \f*.
\q
\v 7  \add It is as though my enemies are like\add* a flood around me;
\q2 reach your hand down from heaven 
\q and rescue me from them \f + \ft synecdoche \f*. 
\q They are men from other countries 
\q
\v 8 who \f + \ft synecdoche \f* always tell lies. 
\q \add Even in a courtroom where\add* 
\q2 they tell lies. 
\b
\q
\v 9 God, I will sing a new song to you, 
\q2 and I will play my ten-stringed harp \add while I sing\add* to you.
\q
\v 10 You enable kings to defeat \add their enemies\add*; 
\q2 you rescue\f + \ft Or: save \f* \add those who\add* serve you like I \add did\add*.
\b
\q
\v 11  \add So I ask you to\add* save me from \add being killed by\add* the swords that those evil people carry.
\q Rescue me from the power \f + \ft metonymy \f* of those foreigners 
\q2 who \f + \ft synecdoche \f* always tell lies, 
\q2 and who raise their right hands \add in courtrooms when they solemnly declare that they will tell the
truth\add*. 
\b
\q
\v 12 I wish\f + \ft Or: hope \f* that our young sons will grow up to be like strong plants \f + \ft simile \f*,
\q and I wish\f + \ft Or: hope \f* that our daughters will grow up to be \add straight and
tall\add* 
\q2 like the pillars \f + \ft simile \f* that stand in the corners of palaces.
\q
\v 13 I wish\f + \ft Or: hope \f* that our barns will be full of many different crops.
\q I wish\f + \ft Or: hope \f* that the sheep in our fields will give birth to tens of thousands of baby lambs.
\q
\v 14 I wish\f + \ft Or: hope \f* that our cows will give birth to many calves 
\q2 without having any miscarriages or deaths when they are born \f + \ft Or: that no enemies will break through our city walls and
take us into exile\f + \ft Or: to their own countries \f* \f*. 
\q I wish\f + \ft Or: hope \f* that \add there will not be a time when\add* the people in our streets cry out in distress
\q2 \add because foreign armies are invading\add*. 
\b
\q
\v 15 If good things like that happen to a nation,
