\c 139  
\s A psalm written by David for the choir director 
\q
\v 1 Yahweh, you have examined what is in my \add inner being\add*,
\q2 and you know \add everything about\add* me. 
\q
\v 2 You know when I sit down and when I stand up. 
\q \add Even though you are\add* far away from me, 
\q2 you know what I am thinking. 
\q
\v 3  \add From the time that I rise in the morning\add* until I lie down
\add to sleep at night\add*, 
\q2 you know everything that I do. 
\q
\v 4 Yahweh, even before I say \f + \fr metonymy \f* anything, 
\q2 you know everything that I am going to say! 
\b
\q
\v 5 You protect me on all sides; 
\q2 you put you hand on me \add to protect me with your power\add* \f + \fr metonymy \f*.
\q
\v 6 I am not able to understand that you know \add everything about
me\add*. 
\q2 That is too great for me to really understand. 
\b
\q
\v 7 ◄Where could I go to escape from your Spirit?/I could not go anywhere to escape from your Spirit.► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*
\q ◄Where could I go to get away from you?/I could not go anywhere to get away from you.► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*
\q
\v 8 If I went up to heaven, you would be there. 
\q If I laid down in the place where the dead people are, you would be there.
\q
\v 9 If I had wings and flew very far east \f + \fr metonymy \f*, 
\q or if I flew west and made a place to live \add on an island\add* in the ocean,
\q
\v 10 you would be there also, to lead me by your hand, 
\q2 and you would help me. 
\b
\q
\v 11 I could request the darkness to hide me, 
\q or I could request the light around me to become darkness, 
\q
\v 12 but even \add if that happened\add*, the darkness would not be darkness for you!
\q For you, the night is \add as bright\add* as the daytime is, 
\q2 because for you, daylight and darkness are ◄not different/the same►.
\b
\q
\v 13 You created all the parts of my body; 
\q2 you put \add the parts of\add* my body together when I was still in my mother's womb.
\q
\v 14 I praise you because you made my \add body\add* very awesomely and wonderfully.
\q Everything that you do is amazing! 
\q2 I know that very well. 
\q
\v 15 When my body was being formed, 
\q while it was being put together where no one else could see it,
\q2 you saw it! 
\q
\v 16 You saw me before I was born. 
\q You wrote in your book the number of days that you had decided that I would live.
\q2 You did that before any of those days had even started! 
\b
\q
\v 17 God, what you think about me is very precious \f + \fr (OR, is very hard to understand) \f*.
\q2 There is a huge amount of the things that you think about. 
\q
\v 18 If I could count them, \add I would see that\add* they are more than the grains of sand
\add at the seashore\add*. 
\q And when I awake, I am still with you 
\q2 \add and I know that there are still more of your thoughts about me to
count\add*. 
\b
\q
\v 19 God, I wish/desire that you would kill the wicked people! 
\q2 And I wish that violent \f + \fr metonymy \f* men would ◄leave/go away from► me.
\q
\v 20 They say wicked/malicious things about you; 
\q2 they slander your name. 
\q
\v 21 Yahweh, I certainly \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* hate those who hate you! 
\q2 And I despise \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* those who rebel against you. 
\q
\v 22 I hate them ◄completely/with all my inner being►, 
\q2 and I consider that they are my enemies. 
\b
\q
\v 23 God, search my inner being; 
\q2 find out what I am thinking! 
\q
\v 24 Find out whether there is anything evil in my \add inner being\add*,
\q2 and lead me along the road \add that leads to my being with you\add* forever.
