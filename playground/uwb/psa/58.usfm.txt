\c 58  
\s A psalm written by David for the choir director, to be sung using the tune 'Do not destroy'
\q
\v 1 When you mighty men speak, you never say what is right; 
\q2 you never decide things about people justly \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*! 
\q
\v 2 No, in your inner beings you think only about doing what is wrong,
\q2 and you commit violent crimes in this land \add of Israel\add*.
\q
\v 3 Wicked people do wrong things and tell lies from the time that they are born \f + \ft doublet \f*.
\q
\v 4 God, show in the heavens how great you are! 
\q2 And show your glory to people all over the earth! 
\q What wicked people say \add injures people like\add* the venom of a snake \f + \ft metaphor \f*;
\q2 They refuse to listen to good advice, \add as though they were\add* cobras that were deaf \f + \ft metaphor \f*!
\q
\v 5 As a result, \add like a snake that does not respond when\add* a charmer plays a flute or when someone sings magic songs,
\q2 \add they do not pay attention when others rebuke them\add*.
\b
\q
\v 6 God, as for these enemies who \add want to attack me like\add* young lions,
\q2 break the teeth in their mouths! 
\q
\v 7 Cause them to disappear like water disappears in dry ground!
\q2 Cause the arrows that they shoot to have no heads\f + \ft Or: sharp points \f*!
\q
\v 8 Cause them to become like snails that disappear in the slime;
\q2 cause them to be like a baby that is born dead! 
\b
\q
\v 9 I hope\f + \ft Or: wish \f* that you will get rid of them 
\q2 \add as fast as\add* thornbushes are blown away \add after they are
cut\add* \f + \ft Or: \add as fast as\add* a fire heats a pot over burning thorns \f*.
\q
\v 10 Righteous people will rejoice when they see wicked people being punished as they deserve;
\q2 they will wash their feet in the blood of wicked people. 
\q
\v 11 Then people will say, “It is true that there is a reward for righteous people;
\q2 and there is indeed a God who judges people justly here on the earth!”
