\c 4  
\s A psalm written by David for the choir director; a psalm to be accompanied by people playing stringed instruments
\q
\v 1 God, answer me when I pray to you. 
\q2 You are the one who vindicates me; 
\q Rescue me from things that distress me. 
\q2 Act mercifully toward me, and listen to me while I pray. 
\q
\v 2 How long will you people cause me to be disgraced instead of honoring me [RHQ]?
\q2 You people love to falsely accuse me. 
\qr (Think about that!) 
\b
\q
\v 3 All those who are loyal to Yahweh, 
\q2 he has chosen them to belong to him. 
\q Yahweh listens to me when I pray to him. 
\b
\q
\v 4 When you people get angry, do not \add allow your anger to control you and cause you
to\add* sin. 
\q While you lie on your bed, 
\q2 silently examine what you are thinking in your inner being. 
\qr (Think about that!) 
\q
\v 5 Also, offer to Yahweh the proper sacrifices, 
\q2 and continue trusting in him. 
\b
\q
\v 6 Some people ask, “Who will allow good things to happen to us?”
\q2 \add But I say\add*, “Yahweh, continue to act kindly toward us.
\q
\v 7 You have caused me to be very happy; 
\q2 I am happier than people who have harvested a great amount of grain and grapes.
\q
\v 8 I can lie down \add at night\add* and sleep soundly 
\q2 because \add I know that\add* you, Yahweh, will keep me safe.”
