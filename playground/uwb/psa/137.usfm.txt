\c 137  
\q
\v 1 When we \add had been taken to Babylonia, far from Jerusalem\add*,
\q we sat down by the rivers there, 
\q2 and we cried when we thought about \add the temple on\add* Zion
\add Hill in Jerusalem\add*. 
\q
\v 2 On the willow trees \add alongside the rivers\add* we hung our harps
\q2 \add because we did not want to play them anymore because we were very
sad\add*. 
\q
\v 3 The \add soldiers\add* who had captured us \add and taken us to
Babylonia\add* told us to sing \add for them\add*; 
\q2 they told us to entertain them\f + \ft Or: make them happy \f*, saying, 
\q2 "Sing for us one of the songs \add that you previously sang in\add* Jerusalem!"
\q
\v 4 But \add we thought to ourselves\add*, 
\q2 "We \add are sad because we have been punished by Yahweh and brought to
this\add* foreign land, 
\q2 so we cannot \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* sing songs about Yahweh while we are here!"
\b
\q
\v 5 If I forget about Jerusalem \f + \ft apostrophe \f*, I hope\f + \ft Or: wish \f* that my right hand will wither
\q2 \add with the result that I will be unable to play my harp\add*!
\q
\v 6 I hope that I will not be able to sing again \f + \ft metonymy \f*, 
\q if I forget about Jerusalem, 
\q2 if I do not consider that Jerusalem causes me to be more joyful than anything else does.
\b
\q
\v 7 Yahweh, \add punish\add* the people of the Edom people-group
\q2 for what they did on the day that the army of Babylon captured Jerusalem.
\q Do not forget that they said, 
\q2 "Tear down all the buildings! Destroy them completely! Leave only the foundations!"
\b
\q
\v 8 And you people of Babylon, you will certainly be destroyed!
\q2 Those who punish you in return for what you did to us will be happy;
\q
\v 9 they will take your babies 
\q2 and completely smash them on the rocks.
