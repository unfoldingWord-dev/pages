\c 1  
\s The people God is pleased with 
\q
\v 1  \add Yahweh\add* is pleased with those who do not do what the \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* wicked people advise them to do,
\q2 and who do not imitate the behavior of \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* of sinful people,
\q and who do not join with people who ◄ridicule\f + \ft Or: sneer \f* at► \add God\add*.
\q
\v 2 Those whom God is pleased with delight in doing the things that Yahweh has instructed\f + \ft Or: taught \f* us to do.
\q2 They read and think about Yahweh's requirements every day and every night.
\q
\v 3 They \add constantly produce\f + \ft Or: do \f* things that please God\add*
\q2 just like fruit trees that have been planted along the banks of a stream produce fruit at the right time every year.
\q Like trees that never wither, 
\q2 they succeed in everything that they do. 
\b
\q
\v 4 But wicked people are not like that! 
\q2 Wicked people are as worthless as chaff 
\q2 that is blown away by the wind. 
\q
\v 5 Therefore, wicked people ◄will not be acquitted\f + \ft Or: will \f* be condemned► \\f + \\ft litotes \\f* when
\add God\add* judges people, 
\q2 and furthermore, sinful people will not even be present when God gathers righteous people together,
\q
\v 6 because Yahweh guides and protects righteous people, 
\q2 but the path that the wicked walk on leads them to where they will be destroyed\f + \ft Or: punished \f*
\add by God forever\add*.
