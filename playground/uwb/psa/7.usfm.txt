\c 7  
\s A psalm that David sang to Yahweh because of David's enemy, Cush
\q
\v 1 Yahweh my God, I come to you to protect me. 
\q2 Rescue me, save me from all those who are pursuing me \add in order to harm
me\add*. 
\q
\v 2 If you do not do that, they will tear me into pieces 
\q2 like a lion does \add when it attacks the animals it want to
kill\add*, 
\q2 and no one will save me \add from them\add*. 
\b
\q
\v 3 Yahweh my God, if I have done anything that is wrong, 
\q2
\v 4 if I have done evil to some friend who did evil to me, 
\q2 or if, for no good reason, I have spared \f + \ft (OR, acted violently toward) those who were my enemies,
\q
\v 5 allow my enemies to pursue me and capture me. 
\q Allow them to trample me into the ground 
\q2 and leave me \\f + \\ft synecdoche \\f* \add lying dead\add* in the dirt. 
\qr (Think about that!) \f* 
\b
\q
\v 6 Yahweh, because you are very angry \add with those who pursue
me\add*, 
\q2 arise and attack\f + \ft Or: resist \f* my enemies who are furiously\f + \ft Or: angrily \f*
\add attacking me\add*! 
\q Do to them what is just! 
\q
\v 7 Gather around you the people of all nations, 
\q2 and rule them from where you are in heaven \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f*. 
\q
\v 8 Yahweh, judge the people of all nations! 
\q2 And, Yahweh, show that I have done nothing that is wrong. 
\q
\v 9 God, you know what every person is thinking in his inner being,
\q2 and because you are righteous, you always do what is just\f + \ft Or: right \f*.
\q So now stop evil people from doing wicked deeds, 
\q2 and defend all of us who are righteous! 
\b
\q
\v 10 God, you protect me like a shield \add protects soldiers\add* \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f*;
\q2 you protect all those who are righteous in their inner being.
\q
\v 11 You judge \add everyone\add* correctly, 
\q2 and every day you punish \add wicked people\add*. 
\q
\v 12 Whenever your enemies do not ◄repent\f + \ft Or: change \f* their behavior►,
\q2 \add it is as though\add* \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* you sharpen your sword and put a string on your bow
\add to get ready to kill them\add*. 
\q
\v 13 You are preparing your weapons that kill those whom they strike;
\q2 the arrows that you will shoot have flaming tips. 
\q
\v 14 Wicked people tell lies, 
\q2 and they think that they surely will be able to do \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* the evil things that they are planning to do
\q2 \add just as surely as\add* a pregnant woman \add knows that she is going to give birth to a
child\add* \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f*. 
\q
\v 15 But when they dig a deep pit to trap others, 
\q2 they themselves will fall into it. 
\q
\v 16 They themselves will experience the trouble that they want to cause others to have;
\q2 they will hurt themselves by the violent things that they want to do to others.
\b
\q
\v 17 I praise Yahweh because he always acts righteously\f + \ft Or: justly \f*;
\q2 I sing to praise Yahweh, the one who is much greater than any other god.
