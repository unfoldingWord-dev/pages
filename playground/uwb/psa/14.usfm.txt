\q
\v 1  \add Only\add* foolish people say to themselves, “There is no God!”
\q People who say those things are corrupt/worthless; they do abominable/detestable deeds;
\q2 there is not one \add of them\add* who does what is good/right.
\b
\q
\v 2 Yahweh looks down from heaven and sees humans; 
\q he looks to see if anyone is very wise, 
\q2 with the result that he desires \add to know\add* God.

\v 7 I wish/desire that \add Yahweh\add* would come from Jerusalem \f + \fr metonymy \f* and rescue us Israeli people!
\q2 Yahweh, when you bless your people again, 
\q2 all of us Israeli people, who are the descendants of Jacob, will rejoice.
