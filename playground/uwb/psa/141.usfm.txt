\c 141  
\s A psalm written by David 
\q
\v 1 Yahweh, I call out to you; 
\q2 \add please\add* help me quickly! 
\q Listen to me when I am calling to you. 
\q
\v 2 Accept my prayer as though it was incense \add being burned as an
offering\add* \f + \fr simile \f* to you. 
\q2 And accept me while I lift up my hands \add to pray\add* to you
\q2 like you accept sacrifices \add that are offered to you in the\add* evening \f + \fr simile \f*.
\b
\q
\v 3 Yahweh, do not allow me to say \f + \fr metonymy \f* things that are wrong 
\q2 as a sentry/guard \add does not allow people who want to do things that are
wrong\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f* to enter a door \add of a building\add*. 
\q
\v 4 Prevent me from wanting to do anything that is wrong, 
\q2 and from joining with wicked men when they want to do evil deeds \f + \fr doublet \f*.
\q Do not even allow me to share in eating delightful food with them!
\b
\q
\v 5 It is all right if righteous people strike/hit me or rebuke me
\q2 because they are trying to act kindly toward me \add to teach me to do what is
right\add*, 
\q but I do not want wicked people to \add honor me by\add* anointing my head with
\add olive\add* oil; 
\q2 I am always praying \add that you will punish them because of\add* the wicked deeds
\add that they do\add*. 
\b
\q
\v 6 When their rulers are thrown down from the top of rocky cliffs,
\q2 people will know that what you, Yahweh, said \add about them\add* is true.
\q
\v 7 Like a log that is split and cut into small pieces \f + \fr simile \f*, 
\q2 their shattered bones will be scattered \add on the ground\add* near
\add other\add* graves. 
\b
\q
\v 8 But Yahweh God, I continue to request that you \add help me\add*.
\q2 I request you to protect me; 
\q2 do not allow me to ◄die/be killed► \add now\add*! 
\q
\v 9  \add It is as though\add* people have set traps for me; 
\q2 protect me from falling into those traps, 
\q2 \add It is as though\add* they have spread nets to catch me;
\q2 keep me from being caught in those nets. 
\q
\v 10 I wish/hope that wicked people will fall into the traps \add they have set to catch
me\add* 
\q2 while I escape from them.
