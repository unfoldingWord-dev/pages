\c 143  
\s A psalm written by David 
\q
\v 1 Yahweh, hear me while I pray to you! 
\q2 Because you are righteous 
\q2 and because you faithfully do what you have promised, 
\q2 listen to what I am pleading that you \add do for me\add*. 
\q
\v 2 I am one who serves you; 
\q do not judge me, 
\q2 because you do not consider anyone to be completely innocent\f + \ft Or: never have done anything that is wrong \f*.
\b
\q
\v 3 My enemies have pursued me; 
\q2 they have completely defeated me. 
\q \add It is as though\add* they have put me in a dark prison, 
\q where I \add have nothing good to\add* \add hope for\f + \ft Or: expect\add* \f*, like those who died long ago \f + \ft simile \f*.
\q
\v 4 So I am very discouraged in my inner being; 
\q2 I am very dismayed\f + \ft Or: worried \f*. 
\b
\q
\v 5 I remember what has happened previously: 
\q2 I meditate on\f + \ft Or: think about \f* all the things that you have done;
\q I consider all the great deeds that you \f + \ft synecdoche \f* have performed.
\q
\v 6 I lift up my hands\f + \ft Or: arms \f* to you while I pray; 
\q2 I \f + \ft synecdoche \f* need you, like very dry ground \add needs rain\add* \f + \ft simile \f*.
\qr (Think about that!) 
\b
\q
\v 7 Yahweh, I am very discouraged, 
\q2 so please answer me right now! 
\q Do not hide from me, 
\q2 because if you do that, I will soon be \f + \ft simile \f* among those who descend to where the dead people are.
\q
\v 8 Every morning cause me to remember that you faithfully love me,
\q2 because I trust in you. 
\q I pray\f + \ft Or: send my prayers up [IDI] \f* to you; 
\q2 show me the things that I should do. 
\q
\v 9 Yahweh, I have gone\f + \ft Or: run \f* to you to be protected, 
\q2 so rescue me from my enemies. 
\q
\v 10 You are my God; 
\q2 teach me to do what you want me to do. 
\q I want your good Spirit to lead me on a path that is not difficult to walk on.
\b
\q
\v 11 Yahweh, restore me when I am close to dying, as you promised to do.
\q2 Because you are righteous\f + \ft Or: good \f*, rescue me from my troubles\f + \ft Or: difficulties \f*!
\q
\v 12 I am one who serves you; 
\q so because you faithfully love me, 
\q2 kill my enemies 
\q2 and get rid of all those who oppress\f + \ft Or: cause trouble for \f* me.
