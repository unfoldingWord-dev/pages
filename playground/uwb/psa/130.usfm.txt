\c 130  
\s A psalm written for people going up to the temple to worship 
\q
\v 1 Yahweh, I have great troubles\f + \ft Or: difficulties \f*, so I call out to you.
\q
\v 2 Yahweh, hear me, 
\q2 while I call out to you \\f + \\ft synecdoche \\f* to help me! 
\b
\q
\v 3 Yahweh, if you kept a record of the sins that we have committed,
\q2 not one of us \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* would escape from being condemned \add and
punished\add*! 
\q
\v 4 But you forgive us, 
\q2 with the result that we have an awesome respect for you. 
\b
\q
\v 5 Yahweh has said \add that he would help\f + \ft Or: rescue \f* me\add*; 
\q2 I trust what he said, and I wait eagerly for him to do that.
\q
\v 6 I wait for Yahweh \add to help me\add* 
\q2 more than watchmen wait for the light to dawn; 
\q2 yes, I wait more eagerly than they do! 
\b
\q
\v 7 You my fellow Israelis, confidently expect that Yahweh \add will bless
us\add*. 
\q2 He will bless us because he faithfully loves us, 
\q2 and he is very willing to save\f + \ft Or: rescue \f* us. 
\q
\v 8 And he will save us Israeli people from \add being punished
for\add* all the sins that we have committed.
