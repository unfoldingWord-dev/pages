\c 116  
\q
\v 1 I love Yahweh, 
\q2 because he hears me when I cry to him for him to help me. 
\q
\v 2 He listens to me, 
\q2 so I will call out to him all during my life. 
\b
\q
\v 3 Everything around me \f + \fr metaphor \f* caused me to think that I would die;
\q2 I was very afraid that I would \add die and go to\add* the place where dead people are.
\q I was very distressed/worried and afraid. 
\q
\v 4 But then I called out to Yahweh, saying, 
\q2 “Yahweh, I plead with you to save/rescue me!” 
\b
\q
\v 5 Yahweh is kind and does what is right; 
\q2 he is our God, and he acts mercifully to us. 
\q
\v 6 He protects those who ◄are helpless/cannot defend themselves►;
\q2 and when I though that I would die, he saved me. 
\b
\q
\v 7 I must encourage/tell myself to ◄have inner peace/not worry anymore►,
\q2 because Yahweh has done very good things for me. 
\b
\q
\v 8 Yahweh has saved me \f + \fr synecdoche \f* from dying, 
\q2 and has kept/protected me from \add troubles that would cause me
to\add* cry. 
\q He has kept/protected me from ◄stumbling/being defeated►. 
\q
\v 9 So here on the earth, where people are still alive, 
\q2 I live knowing that Yahweh is \add directing\add* me. 
\q
\v 10 I continued to believe/trust \add in Yahweh\add*, 
\q2 even when I said, “I am greatly afflicted/troubled.” 
\q
\v 11 Even when I was distressed/worried and said, “I cannot trust anyone,”
\q2 \add I continued to trust in Yahweh\add*. 
\b
\q
\v 12 So now \add I will tell you\add* \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* what I will offer to Yahweh,
\q2 because of all the good things that he has done for me. 
\q
\v 13 I will offer to him a cup \add of wine\add* 
\q2 to thank him for saving/rescuing me. 
\q
\v 14 When I am together with many \f + \fr hyperbole \f* people who belong to Yahweh,
\q2 I will give to him the offerings that I solemnly promised to give to him.
\b
\q
\v 15 Yahweh is very grieved/sad when one of his people dies. 
\q
\v 16 I am one of those who serve Yahweh; 
\q2 I serve him like my mother did. 
\q2 He has freed/saved me from dying (OR, from being fastened by chains).
\b
\q
\v 17 So I will offer to him a sacrifice to thank him, 
\q and I will ◄pray to him/continue to request that he \f + \fr metonymy \f* help me►.
\q
\v 18-19 When I am together with many of \f + \fr hyperbole \f* the people who belong to Yahweh,
\q2 \add in the courtyard\add* outside his temple in Jerusalem, 
\q2 I will give to him the offerings that I solemnly promised to give to him.
\b
\q Praise Yahweh!
