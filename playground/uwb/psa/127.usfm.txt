\c 127  
\s A psalm written by Solomon for people going up to the temple to worship
\q
\v 1 If people are building a house without \add knowing whether\add* it is Yahweh's
\add will to build it\add*, 
\q2 they are building it in vain. 
\q Similarly, if Yahweh does not protect a city, 
\q2 it is useless for guards\f + \ft Or: sentries \f* to stay awake \add to tell people if their enemies come to attack
it\add*. 
\q
\v 2 It is also useless to arise very early and go to sleep late at night
\q2 in order that you can work hard \add all day\add* to \add earn money to
buy\add* food, 
\q because Yahweh gives food to those whom he loves. 
\b
\q
\v 3 Children are a gift \add that comes to parents\add* from Yahweh;
\q2 they are a reward\f + \ft Or: blessing \f* from him. 
\q
\v 4 If a man has sons while he is still young, 
\q \add when they grow up, they will be able to help him defend his
family\add* 
\q2 like \f + \ft simile \f* a soldier \add can defend himself if\add* he has \add a bow
and\add* arrows in his hand. 
\q
\v 5 A man \add who has many sons\add* is very happy, 
\q2 like \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add a soldier who has many arrows\add* in his quiver is very happy.
\q If a man \add with his many grown sons is taken\add* by his enemies to the place where they decide matters, his enemies will
never be able to defeat that man, 
\q2 \add because his sons will help to defend him\add*.
