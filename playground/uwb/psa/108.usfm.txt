\c 108  
\s A psalm written by David 
\q
\v 1 God, I am ◄very confident\f + \ft Or: trusting \f* completely► [IDI] in you.
\q I will sing to praise you. 
\q2 I will awaken myself. 
\q
\v 2 I will arise before the sun rises, 
\q2 and I will \add praise you while I play\add* my big harp and my ◄lyre\f + \ft Or: small \f* harp►.
\q
\v 3  \add I prayed\add*, “Yahweh, I will thank you among \add all\add* the people-groups;
\q2 I will sing to praise you among the nations, 
\q
\v 4 because your faithful love for us reaches up to the heavens,
\q2 and your faithfully doing what you promise \add is as great as the
distance\add* up to the clouds. 
\q
\v 5 Yahweh, \add show\add* in the heavens that you are very great!
\q2 And \add show\add* your glory to people all over the earth! 
\b
\q
\v 6 Answer our \add prayers\add* and by your power help us \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f*
\add to defeat our enemies\add* 
\q in order that we, the people whom you love, may be saved\f + \ft Or: rescued \f*.”
\q
\v 7 And \add Yahweh answered our prayers and\add* spoke from his temple, saying, “Because I have conquered
\add your enemies\add*, I will joyfully divide Shechem \add city\add*
\q2 and I will distribute among my people \add the land in\add* Succoth
\add Valley\add*. 
\q
\v 8 The Gilead \add region\add* in mine; 
\q2 the \add people of the tribe of\add* Manasseh are mine; 
\q and the tribe of Judah is like the ◄scepter\f + \ft Or: stick \f* that I hold which shows that I am the ruler► \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f*;
\q
\v 9 the Moab \add region\add* is like my washbasin \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f*; 
\q2 I throw my sandal in the Edom \add area to show that it belongs to
me\add*; 
\q2 I shout triumphantly because I have defeated \add the people
of\add* the Philistia area.” 
\b
\q
\v 10  \add Because we want to attack the people of\add* Edom, 
\q ◄who will lead my \add army triumphantly\add* to their \add capital\add* city that has strong walls around it?\f + \ft Or: I \f* want
someone to lead my \add army triumphantly\add* to their \add capital\add* city that has strong walls around it.► \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f*
\q
\v 11 God, we \add desire\f + \ft Or: hope \f* that\add* \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* you have not abandoned us,
\q2 and that you will go with us when our army marches out \add to fight our
enemies\add*. 
\q
\v 12  \add We need you to\add* help us when we fight against our enemies,
\q2 because the help that humans can give us is worthless. 
\q
\v 13 But with you \add helping us\add*, we shall win; 
\q2 you will enable us to defeat our enemies.
