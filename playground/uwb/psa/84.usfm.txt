\c 84  
\s A psalm written by one of the descendants of Korah for the choir director
\q
\v 1 Lord, you who are the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels,
\q2 your temple is very beautiful! 
\q
\v 2 I \f + \fk synecdoche \f* would like to be there; 
\q2 Yahweh, I desire that very much \f + \fk doublet \f*. 
\q2 With all my inner being I sing joyfully to you, the all-powerful God.
\b
\q
\v 3 Even sparrows and swallows have built nests \add near your temple\add* \f + \fk doublet \f*;
\q2 they take care of their young babies near the altars \add where people offer sacrifices
to\add* you, 
\q2 who are the commander of the armies of heaven, and my king and my God.
\q
\v 4 ◄Happy are/You are pleased with► those who ◄live/continually worship► in your temple,
\q2 constantly singing to praise you. 
\qr (Think about that!) 
\b
\q
\v 5 Happy are those who \add know that\add* you are the one who causes them to be strong,
\q those who strongly desire to ◄make the trip/go► to Zion \add Hill\add*.
\q
\v 6 While they travel through the \add dry\add* Baca Valley, 
\q \add you cause\add* it to become a place where there are springs of water,
\q2 where the rains ◄in the autumn/before the cold season► fill the valley with pools of water.
\q
\v 7 As a result, \add those who travel through there\add* become stronger/refreshed
\q2 \add knowing that\add* they will appear in your presence ◄on Zion
\add Hill\add*/in Jerusalem►. 
\b
\q
\v 8 Yahweh, commander of the armies of heaven, listen to my prayer;
\q God, who \add is worshiped by\add* us ◄descendants of Jacob/Israeli people►, hear [IDI] what I am saying!
\qr (Think about that!) 
\q
\v 9 God, act kindly toward [IDI] our king, the one who protects us \f + \fk metonymy \f*,
\q2 the one whom you have chosen \f + \fk metonymy \f* \add to rule us\add*. 
\b
\q
\v 10  \add For me\add*, spending one day in your temple 
\q2 is better than spending a thousand days somewhere else; 
\q \add standing\add* at the entrance to your temple, \add ready to go
inside\add*, 
\q2 is better than living in the tents/homes where wicked people
\add live\add*. 
\q
\v 11 Yahweh our God is like the sun \add that shines on us\add* and like a shield
\add that protects us\add* \f + \fk metaphor \f*; 
\q2 he acts favorably toward us and honors us. 
\q Yahweh does not refuse to give any good thing/blessing to those who do what is right.
\b
\q
\v 12 Yahweh, commander of the armies of heaven, 
\q2 ◄happy are/you are pleased with► those who trust in you!
