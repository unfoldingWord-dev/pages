\c 36  
\s A psalm written for the choir director by David, a man who served God faithfully
\q
\v 1  \add A continual desire to\add* sin is in the inner beings of wicked people.
\q They consider [IDI] that they have do not need to have an awesome respect for God.
\q
\v 2 Because they are very proud, 
\q2 they do not think that God will discover their sins and condemn them \f + \ft Or: they do not think about their sins and hate
themselves for it \f*. 
\q
\v 3 Everything that they say is deceitful and full of lies; 
\q2 they no longer do what is good 
\q2 and are no longer wise. 
\q
\v 4 While they are lying on their beds they plan to do things to harm others;
\q2 they are determined to do things that are not good, 
\q2 and they never reject \add doing what is\add* evil. 
\b
\q
\v 5 Yahweh, your faithful love for us reaches as high as the heavens,
\q2 your faithful doing what you have promised extends up to the clouds.
\q
\v 6 Your righteous behavior is \add as permanent as\add* the highest mountains \f + \ft metaphor \f*,
\q2 your acting justly \add will continue as long as\add* the deepest oceans will continue.
\q You take care of people and you take care of animals. 
\q
\v 7 God, your faithful love for us is very precious. 
\q You protect us like birds protect their baby birds under their wings \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\q
\v 8 You provide for us plenty of food from the abundant supply [IDI] that you have;
\q2 your great blessings for us flow like a river. 
\q
\v 9 You are the one who causes everything to live; 
\q2 your light is what enables us to see. 
\b
\q
\v 10 Continue to faithfully love those who have experienced a relationship with you,
\q2 and bless those who act righteously\f + \ft Or: justly \f*. 
\q
\v 11 Do not allow proud people \f + \ft synecdoche \f* to attack me, 
\q2 or allow wicked people to chase me away. 
\q
\v 12 Look where evil people have fallen on the ground, defeated;
\q2 they were thrown down, and they will never rise again.
