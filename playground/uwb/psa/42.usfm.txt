\c 42  
\s A psalm written by one of the descendants of Korah for the choir director
\q
\v 1 Deer desire to drink water from a stream of cool water. 
\q2 In the same way \f + \ft simile \f*, God, I need you very much. 
\q
\v 2 I desire to have fellowship with \f + \ft metaphor \f* you, the all-powerful God.
\q2 \add I say to myself\add*, “When will I be able to go \add back to the temple in
Israel\add* 
\q2 and worship in your presence again?” 
\q
\v 3 Every day and every night I cry; 
\q2 the only thing I have to drink is my tears; 
\q and while I do that, my enemies are continually asking me, 
\q2 “Why does your god not \add help you\add*?” 
\q
\v 4 I am very distressed [IDI] as I remember 
\q2 when I went with the crowd of people to the temple \add in Jerusalem\add*,
\q2 leading them as we walked along; 
\q we were all shouting joyfully and singing to thank God \add for what he had
done\add*; 
\q2 we were a large group who were celebrating. 
\b
\q
\v 5 So \add I say to\add* myself, “Why am I sad and discouraged?\f + \ft Or: I should not be sad and discouraged! \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\q I confidently expect God \add to bless me\add*, 
\q2 and again I will praise him, 
\q2 my God, the one who saves me.” 
\b
\q
\v 6 But now, \add Yahweh\add*, I am very discouraged [IDI], 
\q2 so I think about you. 
\q \add You are there in Israel\add* where the Jordan \add River\add* rushes down from the bottom of Hermon
\add Mountain\add* and Mizar Mountain. 
\q
\v 7 But here, the great sorrow that I feel is like water that you send down \f + \ft metaphor \f*;
\q2 it is like a waterfall that tumbles down and floods over me.
\b
\q
\v 8 I desire that \f + \ft Or: I know that \f* Yahweh will show me each day that he faithfully loves me,
\q2 in order that each night I will \f + \ft Or: each night I \f* sing to him
\q2 and pray to him, the God who causes me to live. 
\b
\q
\v 9 I say to God, who is like a huge rock \add under which I can
hide\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, 
\q “◄Why have you forgotten me, with the result that I ‘mourn\f + \ft Or: cry \f*’ constantly because my enemies act cruelly toward me?\f + \ft Or: It \f*
seems that you have forgotten me, with the result that I ‘mourn\f + \ft Or: cry \f*’ constantly because my enemies act cruelly toward me.►”
\f + \ft rhetorical question \f* 
\q
\v 10 They make fun of me constantly; 
\q2 they continually ask, “Why does your god not help you?” \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\q And when they insult me \add like that\add*, 
\q2 \add it is like\add* wounds that shatter\f + \ft Or: smash \f* my bones. 
\b
\q
\v 11 But \add I say to\add* myself, 
\q2 “Why am I sad and discouraged?\f + \ft Or: I should not be sad and discouraged! \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\q I will confidently expect God \add to bless me\add*, 
\q2 and I will praise him again, 
\q2 my God, the one who saves me.”
