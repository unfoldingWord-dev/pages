\c 61  
\s A psalm written by David for the choir director, to be accompanied by musical instruments
\q
\v 1 God, listen to me, 
\q2 and answer my prayer \f + \fr doublet \f*. 
\q
\v 2 While I am discouraged and far from my home, 
\q I am calling out to you. 
\b
\q Lead me to \add a place that will be like\add* a high rock \f + \fr metaphor \f*
\q2 on top of which I will be safe. 
\q
\v 3 You have been my refuge; 
\q2 you have been like a strong tower \f + \fr metaphor \f* 
\q2 \add in which I am safe\add* from being attacked by my enemies.
\b
\q
\v 4 Allow me to live close to your temple all during my life \f + \fr hyperbole \f*!
\q Allow me to be safe \f + \fr metaphor \f*, \add like a little bird is safe\add* under
\add its mother's\add* wings. 
\qr (Think about that!) 
\q
\v 5 God, you heard me when I solemnly promised \add to give offerings to
you\add*; 
\q2 you have given to me the blessings that belong to those who have an awesome respect for you \f + \fr metonymy \f*.
\b
\q
\v 6  \add I am\add* the king \add of Israel\add*; 
\q please allow me to live \add and rule\add* for many years, 
\q2 and allow my descendants to rule also. 
\q
\v 7 Allow us to rule forever while you observe us; 
\q2 watch over us while you faithfully love us and do for us what you promised.
\b
\q
\v 8 If you do that, I will always sing to praise you \f + \fr metonymy \f* 
\q2 while I offer to you each day the sacrifices that I promised to give to you.
