\c 48  
\s A psalm written by one of the descendants of Korah 
\q
\v 1 Yahweh is great, and he deserved to be greatly praised in the city where he
\add lives\add*, 
\q2 \add which is built on Zion\add*, his sacred hill. 
\q
\v 2 That city, on a high \add hill\add*, is beautiful; 
\q2 it is the city where the true \add God\add*, the great king \add lives\add*,
\q2 and it causes people all over the world to rejoice \add when they see
it\add*. 
\q
\v 3 God is in the strong towers there, 
\q2 and he shows that he protects the people in that city. 
\b
\q
\v 4 Many kings gathered \add with their armies\add* to attack \add that
city\add*, 
\q
\v 5 but when they saw it, they were amazed; 
\q2 they became terrified, and ran away. 
\q
\v 6 Because they were very afraid, they trembled 
\q2 like a woman who is about to give birth to a child; 
\q
\v 7 they shook like ships sailing from Tarshish are shaken by a strong wind.
\b
\q
\v 8 We had heard \add that this city is glorious\add*, 
\q and now we have seen that it is. 
\q2 It is the city in which Yahweh, the one who is greater that all their gods,
\add lives\add*. 
\q2 It is the city which God will preserve\f + \ft Or: protect \f* forever. 
\qr (Think about that!) 
\b
\q
\v 9 God, here in your temple we think about your faithfully loving us.
\q
\v 10 You \f + \ft metonymy \f* are famous and are praised\f + \ft Or: people praise you \f* all over the earth,
\q2 because you rule powerfully \f + \ft metonymy \f* and justly. 
\q
\v 11 The people who live near Zion Hill should be happy! 
\q The people in all the cities \f + \ft metonymy \f* of Judah should rejoice 
\q2 because you judge people fairly. 
\b
\q
\v 12  \add You Israeli people should\add* walk around Zion \add Hill\add*
\q2 and count the towers there; 
\q
\v 13 notice the walls there and examine the forts 
\q2 in order that you can tell about them to your children. 
\q
\v 14  \add Say to them\add*, “This is \add the city of\add* our God,
\add the one who lives\add* forever; 
\q2 he will guide us during all of our lives.”
