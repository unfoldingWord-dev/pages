\c 68  
\s A psalm written by David for the choir director 
\q
\v 1 God, arise and scatter your enemies, 
\q and you cause those who hate you to run away from you. 
\q
\v 2 Like \add wind\add* blows smoke away, 
\q2 you chase your enemies away. 
\q Like wax melts when it is near a fire, 
\q2 you cause wicked people to ◄disappear/be destroyed►. 
\q
\v 3 But righteous people are joyful; 
\q2 they rejoice when they are in God's presence; 
\q2 they are happy, and they are very joyful. 
\b
\q
\v 4 Sing to God; sing to praise him; 
\q sing a song \f + \ft (OR, make a road) for him who rides on the clouds;
\q his name is Yahweh; be glad when you are in his presence. 
\q
\v 5 God, who lives in his sacred temple, is like \f + \fk metaphor \f* a father to those who are orphans,
\q2 and he is the one who protects widows. 
\q
\v 6 He provides families \add to live with\add* for those who have no one to live with.
\q He frees prisoners and enables them to be successful, 
\q2 but those who rebel \add against him\add* will be forced to live in a very hot and dry land.
\b
\q
\v 7 God, you led your people out \add of Egypt\add*, 
\q2 and then you marched with them through the desert. 
\qr (Think about that!) 
\q
\v 8 After you did that, because you, the God \add worshiped by\add* us Israeli people, appeared to us,
\q the earth shook at Sinai \add Mountain\add*, 
\q2 and rain poured down from the sky. 
\q
\v 9 You caused plenty of rain to fall there \add in the desert\add*,
\q2 and so you enabled good crops to grow again on that land that you gave to us Israelis.
\q
\v 10 Your people built homes there; 
\q2 and because you were good to them, you provided food for those who were poor.
\b
\q
\v 11 The Lord spoke this message, 
\q2 and many women took his message to other places. 
\q
\v 12  \add They proclaimed\add*, “Many kings and their armies are running away
\add from our army\add*!” 
\q2 \add When our army brought back to their homes\add* the things that they captured,
\q the women who were at home divided up those things \add among themselves and among their
families\add*. 
\q
\v 13 Even those women who were lying \add on the ground\add* in the pens where the sheep are kept
\add received some of those things\add*; 
\q2 they got statues of doves whose wings were covered with silver
\q2 and whose feathers were covered with pure yellow gold. 
\q
\v 14 When Almighty \add God\add* scattered the \add enemy\add* kings
\add and their armies\add*, 
\q2 \add the number of weapons that they abandoned there\add* seemed like there had been a snowstorm on Zalmon (OR, a black)
\add Mountain\add*! 
\b
\q
\v 15 There is a very high mountain in the Bashan \add region\add*,
\q a mountain which has many peaks. 
\q
\v 16 But the \add people who live near\add* that mountain should not \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* envy those who live near
\add Zion\add*, 
\q2 the mountain on which God chose to live! 
\q Yahweh will live there forever! 
\q
\v 17  \add After we defeated all our enemies\add*, 
\q \add it was as though\add* the Lord, surrounded by many thousands of strong chariots, descended from Sinai
\add Mountain\add* 
\q and came into the sacred temple \add in Jerusalem\add*. 
\q
\v 18 He ascended the sacred mountain \add where his temple is\add*,
\q and took with him many people who had been captured \add in battles\add*;
\q2 and received gifts from the enemies \add whom he had defeated\add*.
\q He received gifts even from those who had rebelled against him,
\q2 and Yahweh our God will live there \add in his sacred temple\add* forever.
\b
\q
\v 19 Praise the Lord, who \add helps us\add* carry our heavy loads every day;
\q he is the one who saves/rescues us. 
\qr (Think about that!) 
\q
\v 20 Our God is the God who saves us; 
\q2 He is Yahweh, our Lord, the one who ◄allows us to escape/prevents us► from being killed
\add in battles\add*. 
\b
\q
\v 21 But God will smash the heads of his enemies, 
\q2 the long-haired skulls of those who continue to behave sinfully.
\q
\v 22 The Lord said, “I will bring back the \add corpses of those who were killed
in\add* Bashan, 
\q and I will bring back those who sank deep in the ocean \add and
drowned\add*. 
\q2
\v 23 I will do that in order that you may wash your feet in their blood,
\q2 and your dogs can also lap up some of your enemies' blood.” 
\b
\q
\v 24 God, many people see you march triumphantly into your sacred temple
\q2 \add celebrating that you have defeated your enemies\add*. 
\q2 You \add march like\add* a king does, and a large crowd walks with you.
\q
\v 25 The singers are in front, and the people who play stringed instruments are at the rear,
\q2 and young women who are beating their tambourines are between them.
\q
\v 26  \add They are all singing\add*, “You Israeli people, praise God when you gather together;
\q2 praise Yahweh, all you who are descendants of Jacob!” 
\q
\v 27 First come the people of the tribe of Benjamin, the smallest tribe,
\q2 and following them come the leaders of the tribe of Judah and their group,
\q and following them come the leaders of the tribes of Zebulun and Naphtali.
\q
\v 28 God, show people that you are very powerful; 
\q2 show people the power with which you have helped us previously.
\q
\v 29 Show that power from your temple in Jerusalem, 
\q2 where kings bring gifts to you. 
\q
\v 30 Rebuke \add your enemies, such as those in Egypt who are like\add* wild hippopotamuses/animals that live in the reeds;
\q and \add powerful nations that are like\add* bulls that control their calves \f + \fk metaphor \f*;
\q rebuke/trample them until they bow down and give you gifts of silver.
\q2 Scatter the people who delight to make wars. 
\q
\v 31 Then people will bring gifts of bronze (OR, of cloth) to you from Egypt;
\q2 if you do that, the people in Ethiopia will lift up their hands
\add to praise you\add*. 
\b
\q
\v 32 You people who are citizens of kingdoms/countries all over the world, sing to God!
\q Sing praises to the Lord! 
\qr (Think about that!) \f* 
\q
\v 33 Sing to the God, the one who rides in the sky, 
\q2 the sky that \add he created\add* long ago. 
\q Listen as he shouts with a very powerful voice. 
\q
\v 34 Proclaim that God is very powerful; 
\q2 he is the king that rules over Israel, 
\q2 and in the skies \add he also shows that\add* he is powerful.
\q
\v 35 God is awesome as he comes out of his sacred temple; 
\q2 he is the God whom we Israeli people \add worship\add*. 
\q He gives power and strength \f + \fk doublet \f* to his people. 
\b
\q Praise God!
