\c 40  
\s A psalm written by David for the choir director 
\q
\v 1 I waited patiently for Yahweh \add to help me\add*, 
\q2 and he listened to me \f + \ft doublet \f* when I called out to him. 
\q
\v 2  \add When I had many troubles, it was as though\add* I was in a deep pit.
\q2 But he lifted me up out of the mud and slime of that pit; 
\q he set my feet on a \add solid\add* rock, 
\q2 and enabled me to walk safely\f + \ft Or: without falling \f*. 
\q
\v 3 He has given me a new song to sing, 
\q2 a song to praise him who is our God. 
\q Many people will find out \add what he has done for me\add*, 
\q2 and they will revere and trust him. 
\b
\q
\v 4 Yahweh is pleased with those who trust him, 
\q2 those who do not trust in idols 
\q2 or join with those who worship those false gods. 
\q
\v 5 O Yahweh, my God, you have done many wonderful things! 
\q2 No one can list all the wonderful things that you have planned for us.
\q If I tried to tell \add others\add* about all those wonderful things,
\q I would not be able to, 
\q2 because there would be too many for me to mention. 
\b
\q
\v 6 Various kinds of sacrifices and other offerings are not the
\add only\add* things that delight you. 
\q2 You have enabled me to understand that very well [IDI]. 
\q \add Animals\add* burned \add on the altar\add* and other offerings
\q2 are not all that you require \add for sins to be forgiven\add*.
\q
\v 7 So I said to you, “Yahweh, here I am, 
\q2 \add to do\add* the things that have been written in the scroll
\add that contains your laws\add*, 
\q2 things that you want me \add to do\add*.” 
\q
\v 8 O my God, I delight to do what you desire; 
\q2 I \add keep\add* your laws within my inner being. 
\b
\q
\v 9 Whenever all \add your people\add* are gathered, 
\q2 I have told them about how you save us. 
\q2 Yahweh, you know that I have not refused to tell that to them.
\q
\v 10 And I have not kept within me the news that you always act justly\f + \ft Or: fairly \f*;
\q2 when many of your people have gathered together \add to worship you in the
temple\add*, 
\q I have told them that you are faithful to us and save us. 
\q2 I have not concealed that you faithfully love us and act loyally toward us.
\b
\q
\v 11 Yahweh, do not stop acting mercifully toward me. 
\q2 Because you faithfully love me \f + \ft personification \f* and are loyal to me, always protect me.
\q
\v 12 I have many troubles; I cannot count them. 
\q2 My sins are like a flood that has covered me \f + \ft personification, metaphor \f*; 
\q2 \add they are so many that\add* I cannot see \add all of them\add*.
\q The sins that I have committed are more than the hairs on my head.
\q2 I am very discouraged. 
\b
\q
\v 13 O Yahweh, please save me! 
\q2 Come quickly to help me! 
\q
\v 14 Humble those who are happy about my troubles, and cause them to be disgraced\f + \ft Or: ashamed \f*.
\q2 Chase away those who are trying to get rid of me. 
\q
\v 15 I hope\f + \ft Or: desire \f* that those who make fun of me 
\q2 will be dismayed when you defeat them. 
\q
\v 16 But I hope that all those who go to \add worship\add* you will be very joyful \f + \ft doublet \f*.
\q2 I hope\f + \ft Or: desire \f* that those who love you because you saved them will shout repeatedly,
\q “Yahweh is great!” 
\b
\q
\v 17 As for me, I am poor and needy \f + \ft doublet \f*; 
\q2 but \add I know that\add* Yahweh has not forgotten me. 
\q O my God, you are the one who saves and helps me, 
\q2 so please come quickly \add and help me\add*!
