\q
\v 1 Yahweh is pleased with those people who help to provide for the poor;
\q2 he will rescue those people when they have troubles. 
\q
\v 2 Yahweh protects them and allows them to live \add for a long
time\add*. 
\q2 He enables them to be happy in the land \add of Israel\add* 
\q2 and rescues them from their enemies. 
\q
\v 3 When they are sick, Yahweh strengthens them, 
\q2 and he heals them. 
\b
\q
\v 4  \add When I was sick\add*, I said, “Yahweh, act mercifully toward me and heal me;
\q2 \add I know that I am sick because\add* have sinned against you.”
\q
\v 5 My enemies say cruel things about me; 
\q2 they say, “How soon will he die, and then everyone will forget about him \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* \f + \ft (OR, he will not have
\add any descendants to continue\add* his name) \f*?” 
\q
\v 6 When my enemies come to me, they falsely say that they \add are concerned about
me\add*. 
\q2 They listen to bad news about ◄me\f + \ft Or: my \f* health►. 
\q2 Then they go away and tell everywhere what is happening to me.
\b
\q
\v 7 All those who hate me whisper to others about me, 
\q2 and they hope\f + \ft Or: desire \f* that very bad things will happen to me.
\q
\v 8 They say, “He will soon die because of his being sick; 
\q2 he will never get up from his bed \add before he dies\add*.”
\q
\v 9 Even my best friend, whom I trusted very much, 
\q2 who often ate with me, 
\q2 has ◄betrayed me\f + \ft Or: put \f* me into my enemies' hands► [IDI]. 
\b
\q
\v 10 But Yahweh, act mercifully to me, and enable me to become healthy again.
\q2 When you do that, I will be able to ◄pay back my enemies\f + \ft Or: get \f* revenge on my enemies\f + \ft Or: cause \f* my enemies to suffer like they
caused me to suffer►. 
\q
\v 11  \add If you enable me to\add* do that, with the result that my enemies do not defeat me,
\q2 I will know that you are pleased with me. 
\q
\v 12  \add I will know that\add* it is because I have done what is right that you have helped me,
\q2 and \add I will know that\add* you will enable me to be with you forever.
\b
\q
\v 13 Praise Yahweh, the God whom we Israelis \add worship\add*;
\q2 Praise him forever! 
\q2 Amen! I desire that it will be so!
