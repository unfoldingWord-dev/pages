\c 92  
\s A psalm that is to be sung on Sabbath days 
\q
\v 1 Yahweh, it is good for people to thank you 
\q2 and to sing to praise you \f + \fk metonymy \f* who are greater than any other god.
\q
\v 2 It is good to proclaim every morning that you faithfully love us,
\q2 and each night \add to sing songs that\add* declare that you always do what you have promised to do,
\q2
\v 3 accompanied by \add musicians playing\add* harps that have ten strings,
\q2 and by the sounds made by a lyre. 
\b
\q
\v 4 Yahweh, you have caused me to be glad; 
\q2 I sing joyfully because of what you \f + \fk synecdoche \f* have done. 
\q
\v 5 Yahweh, the things that you do are great! 
\q2 But it is difficult for us to understand \add all\add* that you think.
\q
\v 6 There are things \add that you do\add* that foolish people cannot know about,
\q2 things that stupid people cannot understand. 
\q
\v 7 They do not understand that although the number of wicked people increases
\add like blades of\add* grass do \f + \fk simile \f*, 
\q2 and those who do what is evil prosper, 
\q they will be completely destroyed. 
\b
\q
\v 8 But Yahweh, you will ◄be exalted/be honored/rule► forever. 
\b
\q
\v 9 Yahweh, your enemies will \add certainly\add* die, 
\q2 and those who do wicked things will be defeated/scattered. 
\q
\v 10 But you have caused me to be as strong \f + \fk metonymy \f* as \f + \fk simile \f* a wild ox;
\q you have caused me to be very joyful \f + \fk metonymy \f*. 
\q
\v 11 I \f + \fk synecdoche \f* have seen you defeat my enemies, 
\q2 and I have heard those evil men wail/scream while they were being slaughtered.
\b
\q
\v 12 But righteous people will prosper like [SIL] palm trees that grow well,
\q2 or like \f + \fk simile \f* cedar trees that grow in Lebanon. 
\q
\v 13  \add They are like the trees\add* that grow near the temple of Yahweh
\add in Jerusalem\add*, 
\q2 the trees that are close to the courtyard of the temple of our God.
\q
\v 14 Even when righteous people become old, they do many things [IDI]
\add that please God\add*. 
\q2 They remain strong and full of energy, \add like trees that\add* \f + \fk metaphor \f* remain full of sap.
\q2
\v 15 That shows that Yahweh is just; 
\q2 he is like a huge rock \add under which I am safe/protected\add*,
\q2 and he never does anything that is wicked/wrong.
