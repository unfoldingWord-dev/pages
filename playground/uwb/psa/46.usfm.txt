\c 46  
\s A psalm written by one of the descendants of Korah for the choir director
\q
\v 1 God is the one who protects us and causes us to be strong; 
\q2 he is always ready to help us when we have troubles. 
\q
\v 2 So, even if the earth shakes, 
\q2 we will not be afraid. 
\q Even if the mountains fall into the middle of the sea, 
\q
\v 3 and if the water in the sea roars and foams, 
\q2 and the hills shake violently, 
\q2 we will not be afraid! 
\qr (Think about that!) 
\b
\q
\v 4  \add Blessings that come from\add* God are like a river that makes everyone in the city where
\add we worship\add* God joyful. 
\q2 It is the city where the temple of God, who is greater than any other god, exists.
\q
\v 5 God is in this city, and it will never be destroyed; 
\q2 he will come to help \add the people in\add* that city at dawn every day.
\q
\v 6  \add Sometimes\add* the people of many nations are terrified;
\q2 kingdoms ◄are overthrown\f + \ft Or: cease \f* to exist►; 
\q God speaks \add loudly like thunder\add*, 
\q2 and the earth melts \f + \ft (OR, people everywhere become terrified) \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f*.
\b
\q
\v 7 But Yahweh, the commander of the armies of heaven, is with us;
\q2 the God whom Jacob worshiped (OR, we Israeli people worship) is our refuge.
\qr (Think about that!) 
\b
\q
\v 8 Come and ◄see\f + \ft Or: think \f* about► the amazing things that Yahweh has done \\f + \\ft doublet \\f*!
\q
\v 9 He stops wars all over the world; 
\q2 he breaks bows \add and arrows\add*; 
\q2 he destroys spears; 
\q2 he burns up shields. 
\q
\v 10  \add God says\add*, “Be quiet, and remember that I am God!
\q2 I will be honored by the people of all nations. 
\q2 I will be honored all over the earth.” 
\b
\q
\v 11  \add So never forget that\add* Yahweh, the commander of the armies of heaven, is with us;
\q2 the God whom Jacob worshiped (OR, we Israeli people worship) is our refuge.
\qr (Think about that!) \f*
