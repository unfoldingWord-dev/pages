\c 57  
\s A psalm written by David for the choir director, when David went into a cave to escape from Saul; to be sung using the tune
'Do not destroy' 
\q
\v 1 God, act mercifully toward me! 
\q Act mercifully toward me because I come to you to protect me.
\q2 I request you to protect me \add like little birds are protected under their
mother's\add* wings \f + \ft metaphor \f*, 
\q2 until the storm\f + \ft Or: danger \f* is ended. 
\b
\q
\v 2 God, you who are greater than all other gods, 
\q2 I cry out to you, the one who enables me to be\f + \ft Or: do \f* all that you desire.
\q
\v 3 You will answer me from heaven and rescue me, 
\q2 but you will cause those who oppress me to be \add defeated and\add* disgraced!
\qr (Think about that!) 
\q2 God will always faithfully love me and will be faithful\f + \ft Or: will do what he promises \f*.
\b
\q
\v 4  \add Sometimes\add* I am surrounded by \add my enemies who are
like\add* lions that \add kill\add* humans; 
\q2 like lions chew with their teeth \add animals that they kill\add*;
\q but my enemies have spears and arrows, not teeth; 
\q2 and \add the false things that\add* they say \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add hurt people as much
as\add* sharp swords \add hurt people\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. 
\b
\q
\v 5 God, show in the heavens that you are very great! 
\q2 And show your glory to people all over the earth! 
\b
\q
\v 6  \add It is as if\add* [MET, HYP] my enemies spread a net to seize me,
\q2 and I became very distressed [IDI]. 
\q \add It is as if\add* [MET, HYP] they dug a deep pit along the path where I walk,
\q2 but they themselves fell into it! 
\qr (Think about that!) 
\b
\q
\v 7 God, I am very confident \f + \ft doublet \f* in you. 
\q I will sing to you, 
\q2 and I will praise you while I sing. 
\q
\v 8 I will awaken myself; 
\q2 I will arise before the sun rises 
\q2 and \add praise you while I play\add* my big harp or my lyre\f + \ft Or: small harp \f*.
\b
\q
\v 9 Lord, I will thank you among all the people; 
\q and I will sing to praise you among many ethnic groups, 
\q2
\v 10 because your faithful love for us is \add as great as the distance from the
earth\add* to the sky, 
\q2 and because your faithfulness\f + \ft Or: faithfully doing what you promise \f* is
\add as great as the distance\add* up to the clouds \f + \ft metaphor \f*. 
\b
\q
\v 11 God, show in the heavens that you are very great! 
\q2 And show your glory to people all over the earth!
