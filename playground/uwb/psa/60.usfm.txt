\c 60  
\s A psalm written by David for the choir director, a psalm for teaching, to be sung using the tune 'Lily of the promise.'
David wrote it during the wars in northern Syria, and when Joab's army, after returning from the battle, killed 12,000 of the
Edom people-group in Salt Valley 
\q
\v 1  \add I prayed\add*, “God, you have rejected us \add Israelis\add*!
\q Because you have been angry \add with us\add*, 
\q2 you have \add enabled our enemies\add* to break through our ranks.
\q Please enable us to be strong again! 
\q
\v 2  \add When we were defeated, it was as though\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* there was a big earthquake in our land that caused the ground to
split open. 
\q So now, \add just as you can\add* cause the cracks in the land to disappear,
\q2 \add help our army to be strong again\add*, 
\q2 because \add it is as though\add* our country is falling apart\f + \ft Or: being destroyed \f*.
\q
\v 3 You have caused us, your people, to suffer very much; 
\q2 \add it is as though\add* you forced us to drink \add strong\add* wine that caused us to stagger around
\add after we became drunk\add*. 
\b
\q
\v 4 But you have raised a battle flag for those who have a reverential respect for you
\q2 in order that they can gather around it and not \add be killed by the
enemies'\add* arrows. 
\qr (Think about that!) 
\q
\v 5 Answer our \add prayers\add* and enable us by your power \f + \ft metonymy \f* to defeat
\add our enemies\add* 
\q2 in order that we, the people whom you love, will be saved.” 
\b
\q
\v 6 Then God \add answered my prayer\add* and spoke from his temple, saying,
\q “Because I have conquered \add your enemies\add*, I will divide Shechem
\add city\add*, 
\q2 and I will distribute among my people \add the land in\add* Succoth
\add Valley\add*. 
\q
\v 7 The Gilead \add region\add* is mine; 
\q the \add people of the tribe of\add* Manasseh are mine; 
\q the tribe of Ephraim is like my helmet \f + \ft metaphor \f*; 
\q and the tribe of Judah is like the scepter\f + \ft Or: stick that I hold which shows that I am the ruler \f* \f + \ft metaphor \f*;
\q
\v 8 the Moab \add region\add* is like my washbasin \f + \ft metaphor \f*; 
\q2 I throw my sandal in the Edom \add area to show that it belongs to
me\add*; 
\q2 I shout triumphantly because I have defeated \add the people
of\add* the Philistia area. 
\b
\q
\v 9  \add Because I want to defeat the people of\add* Edom, 
\q ◄who will lead my \add army triumphantly\add* to their \add capital\add* city that has strong walls around it?\f + \ft Or: I \f* want
someone to lead my \add army triumphantly\add* to their \add capital\add* city that has strong walls around it.►” \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\q
\v 10 So, God, we \add desire\f + \ft Or: hope \f* that\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* you have not truly abandoned us,
\q2 and that you will go with us when our armies march out \add to fight our
enemies\add*. 
\q
\v 11  \add We need you to\add* help us when we fight against our enemies,
\q2 because the help that humans can give us is worthless. 
\q
\v 12 But with you \add helping us\add*, we shall win; 
\q2 you will enable us to defeat our enemies.
