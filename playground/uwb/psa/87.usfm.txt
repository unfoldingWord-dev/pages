\v 1 The city that Yahweh established is on his sacred hill. 
\q
\v 2 He loves that city, Jerusalem, more than he loves any other city in Israel.
\q
\v 3  \add You people in\add* \f + \ft apostrophe \f* the city that God owns\f + \ft Or: lives in \f*,
\q2 people say wonderful things about your city. 
\qr (Think about that!)

\v 4 Some of those who know about God are the people of Egypt and Babylonia,
\q2 and also the people of Philistia and Tyre and Ethiopia; 
\q2 \add some day they all\add* will say, 
\q2 "\add Although I was not born in Jerusalem\add*, 
\q2 \add because I belong to Yahweh, it is as though\add* I was born there."
\q
\v 5 And concerning Jerusalem, people will say 
\q2 \add "It is as though\add* everyone was born there, 
\q2 and Almighty God will cause that city to remain strong\f + \ft Or: safe \f*\f + \ft Or: secure \f*."
\q
