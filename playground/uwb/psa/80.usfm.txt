\s A psalm written by Asaph for the choir director, to be sung using the tune 'Lilies of the covenant'
\q
\v 1  \add Yahweh\add*, you \add who lead us like\add* a shepherd leads his flock
\add of sheep\add*, 
\q listen to us Israeli people. 
\q You sit on your throne \add in the very holy place in the temple\add*, above the
\add carvings of\add* winged creatures. 
\q
\v 2 Show yourself to the people of the tribes of Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh!
\q2 Show us that you are powerful 
\q2 and come and rescue us! 
\b
\q
\v 3 God, cause our nation to be strong like it was before; 
\q2 act kindly toward us [IDI] in order that we may be saved \add from our
enemies\add*! 
\b
\q
\v 4 Yahweh, you who are the commander of the armies of heaven, 
\q2 how long will you be angry with us, your people, when we pray to you?
\q
\v 5  \add It is as though\add* the only food and drink that you have given us is a cup full of our tears!
\q
\v 6 You have allowed the people-groups that surround us to fight with
\add each other to decide which part of our land each of them will
take\add*; 
\q2 our enemies laugh at us. 
\b
\q
\v 7 God, commander of the armies of heaven, 
\q2 cause our nation to be strong like it was before! 
\q Act kindly toward us in order that we may be saved! 
\b
\q
\v 8  \add Our ancestors were like\add* a grapevine \f + \ft metaphor \f* that you brought out of Egypt;
\q you expelled the other people-groups \add from this land\add*,
\q2 and you put your people in their land. 
\q
\v 9 Like people clear ground to plant a grapevine \f + \ft metaphor \f*, 
\q \add you cleared out the people who were living in this land for us to live in
it\add*. 
\q Like the roots of a grapevine go deep down into the ground and spread \f + \ft metaphor \f*,
\q2 \add you enabled our ancestors to prosper and start living in towns all over this
land\add*. 
\q
\v 10  \add Like huge\add* grapevines cover the hills with their shade
\q2 and their branches are taller than big cedar trees \f + \ft metaphor \f*, 
\q
\v 11  \add your people ruled all of Canaan\add*, from the \add Mediterranean\add* Sea
\add in the west\add* to the \add Euphrates\add* River \add in the
east\add*. 
\b
\q
\v 12 So why have you abandoned us 
\q2 and \add allowed our enemies to\add* tear down our walls? 
\q \add You are like\add* someone who tears down the fences \add around his
vineyard\add*, 
\q2 with the result that all the people who pass by can steal the grapes,
\q2
\v 13 and wild pigs can trample \add the vines\add*, 
\q2 and wild animals can also eat \add the grapes\add*. 
\q
\v 14 You who are the commander of the armies of heaven, turn to\f + \ft Or: stop abandoning \f* us!
\q2 Look down from heaven and see \add what is happening to\add* us!
\q Come and rescue \add us who are like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* your grapevine,
\q
\v 15 who are \add like\add* the young vine that you \f + \ft synecdoche \f* planted and caused to grow!
\b
\q
\v 16 Our enemies have torn down and burned everything in our land;
\q look at them angrily and get rid of them! 
\q
\v 17 But strengthen us people whom you have chosen [IDI], 
\q2 us Israeli people whom you previously caused to be very strong.
\q
\v 18 When you do that, we will never turn away from you again; 
\q2 revive us\f + \ft Or: cause us to be again like we were previously \f*, and then we will praise, Or: worship you.
\b
\q
\v 19 Yahweh, commander of the armies of heaven, restore us; 
\q2 act kindly toward us in order that we may be rescued \add from our
enemies\add*!
