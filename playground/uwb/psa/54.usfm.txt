\v 2 God, listen to my prayer;

\q
\v 3 because strangers are \add trying to\add* attack me; 
\q2 proud men are wanting to kill me; 
\q2 men who do not have any ◄respect for\f + \ft Or: interest \f* in► you. 
\qr (Think about that!) 
\b
\q
\v 4 But God is the one who helps me; 
\q2 Yahweh defends\f + \ft Or: protects \f* me \add from my enemies\add*. 
\q
\v 5 He will cause the evil things that they want to do to me to happen to them instead;
\q2 because he faithfully \add does what he promises\add*, he will get rid of them.
\b
\q
\v 6 Yahweh, I will gladly give an offering to you because I want to,
\q2 and I will thank you \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f*, for you are good \add to me\add*;
\q
\v 7 you have rescued me from all my troubles, 
\q2 and I have seen that you have defeated my enemies.
