\c 69  
\s A psalm written by David for the choir director 
\q
\v 1 O God, save me, 
\q2 because \add I am in great danger\add*. 
\q2 \add It is as though\add* the flood water is up to my neck, \add and I am about to
drown\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. 
\q
\v 2 I continue to sink in the deep mud, 
\q2 and there is no solid ground for me to stand on. 
\q I am in deep water, 
\q2 and the flood is swirling around me. 
\q
\v 3 I am exhausted from calling out \add for help\add*; 
\q2 my throat is very dry. 
\q Because I have cried so much as I have waited for God \add to help
me\add*, 
\q2 my eyes are swollen. 
\q
\v 4 Those who hate me when there is no reason to hate me 
\q2 are more than the number of hairs on my head \f + \ft hyperbole \f*! 
\q Those who want to get rid of me are strong, 
\q2 and they tell lies about me. 
\q They demand that I return to them things that I did not steal!
\q
\v 5 O God, you see the sins that I have committed\f + \ft Or: my sins are not hidden from you \f*.
\q2 You know that I have foolishly \add disobeyed your laws\add*.
\b
\q
\v 6 O Yahweh God, \add you who are the commander\add* of the armies
\add of heaven\add*, 
\q2 do not allow the \add wrong things that\add* I \add have done\add*
\q2 to cause those who trust in you to be disappointed\f + \ft Or: disillusioned \f*\f + \ft Or: dishonored \f*.
\q O God whom we Israeli people \add worship\add*, 
\q2 do not allow me to cause them to be humiliated. 
\q
\v 7 People have insulted\f + \ft Or: ridiculed \f* me because \add I am devoted
to\add* you. 
\q2 They have thoroughly humiliated [IDI] me. 
\q
\v 8 Even my own \add older\add* brothers act as if they do not know me;
\q2 they treat me like a foreigner. 
\q
\v 9  \add Some people have despised your temple\add*; 
\q2 but my zeal for keeping your temple \add holy\add* is like a fire burning inside me.
\q So \add it is as though\add* those who are insulting you are also insulting me.
\q
\v 10 When I have humbled myself and fasted\f + \ft Or: abstained from eating food \f*
\q2 \add to show my sadness about the disgraceful things that they have done to your
temple\add*, 
\q2 they just insult me. 
\q
\v 11 When I put on \add rough\add* sackcloth \add to show that I am
sad\add*, 
\q2 they laugh at [IDI] me. 
\q
\v 12 Even the elders \add of the city\add* say bad things about me.
\q2 The drunkards of the city sing \add disgusting\add* songs about me.
\b
\q
\v 13 But Yahweh, I will \add continue\add* praying to you. 
\q At the time that you choose, answer me and rescue me 
\q2 because of your faithfully loving me. 
\q
\v 14 Do not allow me to sink anymore in the mud. 
\q Rescue me from those who hate me! 
\q2 Lift me up out of these deep waters! 
\q
\v 15 Do not allow the floods to swirl around me, 
\q2 do not allow the deep mud to swallow me; 
\q2 keep me from sinking into the pit \add of death\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. 
\q
\v 16 O Yahweh, answer my prayer and help me 
\q2 because you are good and love me faithfully, 
\q
\v 17 Do not hide yourself from\f + \ft Or: refuse to hear \f* me; 
\q answer me quickly 
\q2 because I am in great trouble. 
\q
\v 18 Come near to me and save me; 
\q rescue me from my enemies. 
\b
\q
\v 19 You know that I am insulted 
\q2 and that people cause me to feel ashamed and dishonored; 
\q you know who all my enemies are. 
\q
\v 20 Their insults have deeply offended me, 
\q2 and I feel helpless\f + \ft Or: am in despair \f*. 
\q I searched for someone who would pity me, 
\q2 but there was no one. 
\q I wanted someone to encourage\f + \ft Or: comfort \f* me, 
\q2 but there were none. 
\q
\v 21  \add Instead\add*, they gave me food \add that tasted like\add* poison,
\q2 and when I was thirsty, they gave me sour wine to drink. 
\b
\q
\v 22 I hope\f + \ft Or: desire \f* that the feasts \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add that they enjoy\add* will become a snare for\f + \ft Or: bring trouble to \f* them,
\q2 and that \add those whom they invite to\add* the sacrificial feasts will also be trapped.
\q
\v 23 I hope\f + \ft Or: desire \f* that their eyes become dim so that they cannot see anything,
\q2 and that their backs\f + \ft Or: bodies \f* will become weaker and weaker. 
\q
\v 24 Show them that you are very angry with them! 
\q2 Because of your great\f + \ft Or: furious \f* anger, chase after them and catch them.
\q
\v 25 Cause their towns to become abandoned\f + \ft Or: deserted \f* 
\q2 and that there will be no one to live in their tents\f + \ft Or: houses \f*.
\q
\v 26  \add Do this\add* because they persecute those whom you have punished,
\q2 they talk about the sins of\f + \ft Or: they want to hurt even more \f* those whom you have wounded.
\q
\v 27 Keep making a record of all their sins, 
\q2 do not acquit\f + \ft Or: pardon \f* them \add for the evil things that they have
done\add*. 
\q
\v 28 Erase their names \f + \ft synecdoche \f* from the book \add containing the names of those who have
eternal\add* life; 
\q2 do not include them in the list of righteous people. 
\b
\q
\v 29 As for me, I have pain and am suffering. 
\q2 O God, protect me and rescue me. 
\b
\q
\v 30 When God does that, I will sing as I praise God, 
\q2 and I will honor him by thanking him. 
\q
\v 31 My doing that will please Yahweh more than \add sacrificing\add* oxen,
\q2 more than offering him full-grown bulls. 
\q
\v 32 Oppressed\f + \ft Or: Afflicted \f* people will see \add that God has rescued
me\add*, 
\q2 and they will be glad. 
\q I desire that all you who request God \add to help them\add* will be encouraged.
\q
\v 33 Yahweh listens to those who are needy; 
\q2 He does not ignore\f + \ft Or: forget \f* those who are oppressed\f + \ft Or: imprisoned \f*.
\b
\q
\v 34 I desire that everything will praise Godâ€” 
\q2 everything that is in heaven and on earth, and all the creatures that are in the seas.
\q
\v 35 God will rescue the people of Jerusalem \add from their enemies\add*,
\q2 and he will rebuild the towns that are in Judah. 
\q His people will live there and again possess the land. 
\q
\v 36 The descendants of his people will inherit it, 
\q2 and those who love him will live there \add safely\add*.
