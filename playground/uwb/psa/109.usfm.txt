\c 109  
\s A psalm written by David for the choir director 
\q
\v 1 God, you are the one whom I praise, 
\q so please answer \add my prayer\add*, 
\q
\v 2 because wicked people slander me 
\q2 and tell \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* lies about me. 
\q
\v 3 They are constantly saying that they hate me, 
\q and they say evil things about me for no reason. 
\q
\v 4 I show them that I want to be their friends 
\q and I pray for them, 
\q2 but \add instead of being kind to me\add*, they say that I have done evil things.
\q
\v 5 In return for my doing good things for them and loving them,
\q2 they do evil things to me and hate me. 
\b
\q
\v 6 So, appoint a wicked \add judge\add* who will judge my enemy,
\q and bring in one of his enemies who will stand up and accuse him.
\q
\v 7 And cause that when the trial \add ends\add*, 
\q2 \add the judge will\add* declare that he is guilty, 
\q2 and that even his prayer will be considered to be a sin. 
\q
\v 8 Then, cause that he will soon die 
\q2 and that someone else will have his job\f + \ft Or: work \f* \f + \ft (OR, possessions) \f*.
\q
\v 9 Cause that his children will not have a father anymore 
\q2 and that his wife will become a widow. 
\q
\v 10 Cause that his children will be forced to leave the ruined homes that they have been living in
\q2 and wander around begging for food. 
\q
\v 11 Cause that all the people to whom he owed money will seize all his property;
\q2 Cause that strangers will take away everything that he worked to acquire.
\q
\v 12 Cause that \add while he is still living\add* no one will act kindly to him,
\q2 and \add after he dies\add*, cause that no one will pity his children.
\q
\v 13 Cause that all his descendants will die 
\q2 and that his grandchildren will not remember who he \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* was.
\q
\v 14 Yahweh, remember \add and do not forgive\add* his ancestors for the evil things that they did,
\q2 and do not even forgive the sins that his mother committed; 
\q
\v 15 think about his sins continually, 
\q2 and cause that his name will be completely forgotten. 
\b
\q
\v 16  \add I pray these things\add* because that man, \add my enemy\add*, never acted kindly to anyone;
\q2 he ◄persecuted\f + \ft Or: cause \f* problems for► poor and needy people 
\q2 and even killed helpless people. 
\q
\v 17 He liked to curse people. 
\q2 So cause those terrible things that he requested to happen to others to happen to him!
\q He did not want to bless others, 
\q2 so cause that no one will bless him! 
\q
\v 18 He cursed other people \add as often\f + \ft Or: easily \f*\add* as he put on his clothes \\f + \\ft simile \\f*;
\q2 cause that the terrible things that he wanted to happen to others will
\add happen to him and\add* enter his body like water \add that he
drinks\add* \\f + \\ft simile \\f*, 
\q2 like olive oil soaks into a person's bones \add when it is rubbed on his
skin\add* \\f + \\ft simile \\f*. 
\q
\v 19 Cause that those terrible things will cling to him like his clothes
\q and be around him like the belt that he wears every day. 
\q
\v 20 Yahweh, I wish\f + \ft Or: hope \f* that you will punish all my enemies that way,
\q2 those who say evil things about me. 
\b
\q
\v 21 But Yahweh, my God, do good things for me 
\q2 in order that I may honor you; 
\q rescue me \add from my enemies\add* 
\q2 because your faithfully loving me is good. 
\q
\v 22  \add I request you to do this\add* because I am poor and needy
\q2 and my inner being is ◄full of pain\f + \ft Or: very \f* troubled\f + \ft Or: discouraged \f*►.
\q
\v 23  \add I think that\add* my time \add to remain alive\add* is short,
\q2 like an evening shadow \add that will soon disappear\add* \\f + \\ft simile \\f*.
\q2 I will be blown away like a locust\f + \ft Or: grasshopper \f* is blown \add by the
wind\add*. 
\q
\v 24 My knees are weak because I have ◄fasted\f + \ft Or: abstained \f* from eating food► very often,
\q2 and my body has become very thin. 
\q
\v 25 The people who accuse me make fun of me; 
\q2 when they see me, they \add insult me by\add* shaking their heads
\add at me as though I were an evil man\add*. 
\q
\v 26 Yahweh, my God, help me! 
\q Because you faithfully love me, rescue me! 
\q
\v 27  \add When you save me\add*, 
\q2 cause my enemies to know that you are the one who has done it!
\q
\v 28 They may curse me, but I ask that you bless me. 
\q2 Cause those who ◄persecute\f + \ft Or: cause \f* problems for► me \add to be defeated and as a
result\add* to be disgraced\f + \ft Or: ashamed \f*, 
\q and cause me to be glad\f + \ft Or: happy \f*! 
\q
\v 29 Cause those who accuse me to be completely disgraced; 
\q2 cause other people to see that they are disgraced, as easily as they see the clothes that they wear \\f + \\ft simile \\f*!
\b
\q
\v 30 But I will thank Yahweh very greatly; 
\q2 I will praise him when I am among the crowd of people \add who are worshiping
him\add*. 
\q
\v 31 I will do that because he defends \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* needy people \add like
me\add*, 
\q2 and saves us from those who have decided\f + \ft Or: declared \f* that we must be executed.
