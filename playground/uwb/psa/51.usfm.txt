\c 51  
\s A psalm written by David for the choir director, concerning the time when the prophet Nathan rebuked David after he had
committed adultery with Bathsheba 
\q
\v 1 O God, act mercifully toward me, 
\q2 because you love me faithfully; 
\q2 because you are very merciful, 
\q2 erase \add the record of\add* the ways that I disobeyed you!
\q
\v 2 Make me pure from the wrong things that I have done; 
\q2 make me clean from \add the guilt of\add* my sin. 
\b
\q
\v 3  \add I say that\add* because I know the ways that I have disobeyed you;
\q2 I cannot forget them. 
\q
\v 4 You, you only, are the one I that have really sinned against,
\q2 and you have seen the evil things that I have done. 
\q When you say that I am guilty, you are right\f + \ft Or: correct \f*, 
\q2 and when you judge me, you justly say \add that I deserve to be
punished\add*. 
\q
\v 5 I have been a sinner since the day that I was born; 
\q2 truly, I have been like that since my mother conceived me. 
\q
\v 6 What you desire is that in my inner being I desire what is true
\q2 in order that you can teach me in my inner being how to act wisely.
\b
\q
\v 7 Purify me from the guilt of my sins, and after that happens, I will be clean
\add in my inner being\add*; 
\q2 cleanse me, and then \add in my inner being\add* I will be ◄whiter than snow\f + \ft Or: very \f* clean►.
\q
\v 8 Allow\f + \ft Or: Cause \f* me to be joyful \\f + \\ft doublet \\f* again; 
\q2 you have ◄crushed my spirit\f + \ft Or: completely \f* discouraged me► \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f*;
\q but now let me rejoice again. 
\q
\v 9 Do not continue to look at the sins [IDI] that I have committed;
\q2 erase the record of the evil things that I have done. 
\b
\q
\v 10 O God, cause my inner being to be pure. 
\q2 Put a new and faithful spirit within me. 
\q
\v 11 Do not send me away from you \add because of my sin\add*, 
\q2 and do not take your Holy Spirit from me. 
\q
\v 12 Cause\f + \ft Or: Allow \f* me to be happy again because of \add knowing\add* that you have freed me
\add from the guilt of my sin\add*, 
\q2 and make my spirit willing \add to obey you\add*. 
\b
\q
\v 13 If you do that, I will \add be able to\add* teach to \add other\add* sinners what you want them to do,
\q2 and they will repent and begin to obey you. 
\q
\v 14 O God, you are the one who saves me; 
\q2 forgive me for being guilty of causing someone \add who was not my
enemy\add* to die. 
\q2 When you do that, I will sing joyfully about your being very good and righteous.
\q
\v 15 O Yahweh, help me to speak 
\q2 in order that I may praise you. 
\q
\v 16 You are not pleased \add only\add* with the sacrifices \add that people bring to
you\add*. 
\q2 If that was \add enough to\add* please you, I would bring you sacrifices.
\q You are not pleased with burnt offerings \add alone\add*. 
\q
\v 17 The sacrifice that you really want is for people to be truly humble and sorry
\add for having sinned\add*; 
\q2 O God, you will not refuse that kind of sacrifice. 
\b
\q
\v 18 O God, be good to \add the people who live in\add* Jerusalem \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f*,
\q2 \add and help them\add* to rebuild the city walls. 
\q
\v 19 When that happens, \add they will bring you\add* the proper sacrifices,
\q2 animals that they completely burn, 
\q2 young bulls that they burn on your altar 
\q2 and you will be pleased.
