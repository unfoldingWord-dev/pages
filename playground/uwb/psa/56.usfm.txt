\c 56  
\s A psalm written by David for the choir director, concerning the time the Philistines seized David in Gath; to be sung using
the tune 'Dove on distant oaks' 
\q
\v 1 God, act mercifully toward me because men have harassed me;
\q2 all day my enemies pursue me. 
\q
\v 2 My enemies harass me all day long; 
\q2 there are many of them who proudly attack me. 
\b
\q
\v 3 But whenever I am afraid, 
\q2 I trust in you. 
\q
\v 4 God, I praise/thank you because you do what you have promised;
\q2 I trust in you, and then I am not afraid. 
\q2 Ordinary humans certainly cannot \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* harm me! 
\b
\q
\v 5 All day long my enemies claim that I said things that I did not say (OR, try to destroy what I am doing);
\q2 they are always thinking of ways to harm me. 
\q
\v 6 In order to cause trouble for me, they hide 
\q2 and watch everything that I do, 
\q2 waiting for \add an opportunity\add* to kill me \f + \fr metonymy \f*. 
\b
\q
\v 7 So, God, punish them for the wicked things that they are doing;
\q2 show that you are angry by defeating those people! 
\q
\v 8 You have counted all the times that I have been wandering alone/distressed;
\q2 it is as though you have put all my tears in a bottle 
\q2 \add in order that you can see how much I have cried\add*. 
\q2 \add You have counted my tears and written\add* the number in your book.
\b
\q
\v 9 When I call out to you, my God, my enemies will be defeated;
\q2 I know that will happen, because you are fighting for me. 
\q
\v 10 I praise/thank you that you do what you have promised; 
\q2 Yahweh, I will always praise you for that \f + \fr doublet \f*. 
\q2
\v 11 I trust in you, and as a result, I will not be afraid. 
\q2 I know that humans cannot really \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* harm me! 
\b
\q
\v 12 I will bring to you the offering that I promised; 
\q I will bring an offering to you to thank you, 
\q
\v 13 because you have rescued me from being killed; 
\q2 you have kept me from stumbling. 
\q2 Ordinary humans certainly cannot \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* harm me! 
\q2 As a result, I will continue to live in your presence in the light that
\add shines on those who are still\add* alive (OR, in the light that
\add enables people to\add* live).
