\s Romans 5:1-5 
\s Because God has erased the record of our sins, we have peace with him, we experience his acting kindly toward us, we rejoice
because we expect to receive God's glory, and we even rejoice in suffering because we know the results that it brings.
\p
\v 1 Because we trusted \add in Christ\add*, the record of our sins has been erased
{\add God\add* has erased the record of our sins}. So we \add now\add* have a peaceful relationship with God because of our
trust in what our Lord Jesus Christ \add has done for us\add*. 
\v 2 Because of \add what\add* Christ \add has done\add*, God has also enabled us to begin experiencing his continually acting
toward us in ways that we do not deserve. Also, we rejoice because we are confidently expecting that God
\add will gladly show\add* us how great he is. 
\v 3 We rejoice even when we suffer \add as a result of our trusting in
Christ\add*, because we know that when we are suffering, the result is that we learn to endure things
\add patiently\add*. 
\v 4 And \add we know\add* that when we endure things \add patiently\add*, the result is that
\add God\add* approves \add of us\add*. And when we \add know that
God\add* approves \add of us\add*, the result is that we confidently expect
\add that he will do great things for us\add*. 
\v 5 And we are very confident \f + \fr personification \f* concerning the things that we wait expectantly
\add for\add*, because God loves us very much. His Holy Spirit, who has been {whom
\add he\add* has} given to us, \add causes\add* us to understand how much God loves us.
\s Romans 5:6-11 
\s Because Christ died for us ungodly people, he will certainly save us from God's eternal punishment, and so we boast of what
he has done for us. 
\p
\v 6 When we were unable \add to save ourselves\add*, it was Christ who, at the time
\add that God chose\add*, died on behalf of \add us\add* ungodly
\add people\add*. 
\v 7 Rarely would anyone die on behalf of another person, \add even
if\add* that person were righteous, although for a good person perhaps someone might be courageous enough to die on behalf of
such a person. 
\v 8 Nevertheless, as for God, the way he showed us that he loves us is that Christ died on our behalf while we were still
rebelling against God. 
\v 9 The record of our sins has been erased {\add God\add* has erased the record of our sins} because of
\add what Christ accomplished when\add* his blood \f + \fr metonymy \f* \add flowed when he
died\add*. So it is even more certain that we will be saved by Christ {that Christ will save us} from God's punishing us
\add eternally\add* \f + \fr metonymy \f*. 
\v 10 Even when we were acting hostilely towards God, he enabled us to have a peaceful relationship with him as a result of his
Son dying \add for us\add*. So it is even more certain that we will be saved {Christ will be able to save us}
\add from God's punishing us\add* \f + \fr metonymy \f* because he is alive \add again\add* and because
\add God\add* has enabled us to have a peaceful relationship \add with
himself\add*. 
\v 11 And that's not all! Now we also rejoice about \add the things
that\add* God \add has done for us\add* because of our Lord Jesus Christ
\add dying for us\add* and enabling us to have a peaceful relationship with God.
\s Romans 5:12-21 
\s Although the sin of one man, Adam, led to all people dying and God declaring that they deserved to be punished, Christ's
righteous act of obedience when he died led to many people experiencing God's kindness and being declared righteous and living
eternally, and it will also result in their ruling with Christ. 
\p
\v 12  \add What you can learn from what I have written so far is as
follows\add*: All people are sinful \f + \fr personification \f*, and that is the result of
\add Adam, the first\add* man whom \add God created, sinning long
ago\add*. Adam died \f + \fr personification \f* because he sinned. So, all people \add who have lived since
then\add* die, because \add it is as though\add* all people sinned
\add when Adam sinned\add*. 
\v 13  \add People in\add* \f + \fr metonymy \f* the world sinned before \add God gave
his\add* laws \add to Moses\add*. But people are not considered \add by
God\add* {\add God\add* does not consider people} to be guilty for their sins if there is no law
\add stating that what they did was sinful\add*. 
\v 14 But \add we know\add* that from \add the time when\add* Adam
\add lived\add* until \add the time when\add* Moses \add lived\add*, all people sinned, and they died
\add as a consequence\add* [PRS, MET]. Even people who sinned differently from the way Adam
\add sinned, died\add*. \add Adam's sin\add* affected \add all people\add*, just like what
\add Christ did\add*, the one who came later, can affect all people.
\v 15 But \add the results of God's erasing the record of our sins
as\add* a gift to us are not like \add the results of Adam's\add* sinning. The result of one man,
\add Adam\add*, sinning was that many/all people have died. But \add it is
certain\add*, \add however\add*, that many people have abundantly experienced God's acting kindly toward them in a way they did
not deserve. \add It is also certain\add* that they have experienced God's erasing the record of their sins as the result of
one man, Jesus Christ, acting kindly toward them/towards them in a way they did not deserve.
\v 16 And \add there is another way in which God's\add* freely \add erasing the record of our
sins\add* is not like \add the results of Adam's\add* sinning. One person,
\add Adam, sinned\add*. As a result, God declared that all people deserve to be punished. Many people sinned. But what God did
was that he erased the record of their sins without their earning it.
\v 17 All people die [MET, PRS] because of what one man, \add Adam\add*, did. But now many of us experience that God has
abundantly acted towards us in ways we did not deserve, and we experience that he has erased the record of our sins without our
earning it. It is also very certain that we will rule \add with Christ\add* \f + \fr (OR, share
\add the glory\add* of Christ's being king) \f*, \add in heaven. This will
happen\add* because of \add what\add* one man, Jesus Christ, \add did for
us\add*. 
\p
\v 18 So, \add because one man, Adam\add*, disobeyed \add God's law\add*, that resulted in all people deserving to be punished
{that God punish them}. Similarly, because one man, \add Jesus\add*, acted righteously
\add by obeying God when he died\add*, the result was that God is
\add able to erase the record of\add* all people's sins and \add enable them
to\add* live eternally. 
\v 19 It was because one person, \add Adam\add*, disobeyed \add God\add* that many/all people became sinners. Similarly, it is
because one person, \add Jesus\add*, obeyed \add God when he died\add* that the record of many people's sins will be erased
{that \add he\add* will erase the record of many people's sins}.
\v 20  \add God gave\add* \f + \fr personification \f* his laws \add to Moses\add* \f + \fr personification \f* in order that
\add people might realize\add* how greatly they had sinned; but as people sinned more, God continued to act even more kindly
toward them, in a way that they did not deserve. 
\v 21 He did that in order that just like people everywhere inevitably sin,
\add which results in their\add* dying [MET, PRS], people everywhere might inevitably experience God's acting kindly towards
them in a way they do not deserve [MET, PRS] by \add erasing the record of their
sins\add*. \add The result is that people can\add* live eternally because of what Jesus Christ our Lord
\add did for them\add*.
