\c 4  
\s Romans 4:1-8 
\s We can draw conclusions from Abraham's life about how God erases the record of our sins. Abraham could not boast about his
accomplishing that because the Scriptures record that it was because he believed what God promised that God erased the record
of his sins. God's doing that was a gift, not a reward. 
\p
\v 1 Abraham is the \add revered\add* ancestor of us \add Jews\add*. So ◄think about what we can conclude
\add from what happened to Abraham about how God can erase the record of our
sins\add*.\f + \ft Or: what \f* can we conclude \add from what happened to Abraham about how God can erase the record of our
sins\add*?► \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* 
\v 2 If it was because of Abraham's doing \add good\add* things that the record of his sins was erased {that
\add God\add* erased the record of his sins}, Abraham could then have been able to boast
\add about that to people\add*, but he would not have \add had any basis
to\add* boast to God \add about it\add*. 
\v 3  \add Remember that\add* in the Scriptures it is written {someone wrote} \\f + \\ft personification \\f* that Abraham believed what God
\add promised\add* \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f*, and as a result the record of his sins was erased
{\add God\add* erased the record of his sins}. 
\v 4 If we receive wages for work that we do, those wages are not considered to be a gift. Instead, they
\add are considered\add* to be what we have earned. \add Similarly, if God erases the record of our sins because we did things
to earn God's favor\add*, we would not consider that \add God's erasing the record of our
sin\add* was \add a gift. Instead, we would consider it as what we had
earned\add*. 
\v 5 But suppose that we do not do things \add to gain God's acceptance\add*. Suppose that we instead trust
\add in God\add*, who erases the record of sins of wicked people. Then the erasing of the record of our sins because of our
trusting \add in Christ\add* is considered to be a gift to us, \add not something that we
earned\add*. 
\v 6 Similarly, it is as David wrote \add in the Psalms\add* about people being happy whose record of sins God has erased even
though they have not done things \add to earn it. David wrote\add*:
\q
\v 7  \add God\add* is pleased with people whose sins have been {whose sins
\add he\add* has} forgiven, and whose sins he \add has decided\add* to forget \\f + \\ft doublet \\f*.
\q
\v 8  \add God\add* causes to be happy the people whose sins he no longer keeps a record of.
\s Romans 4:9-12 
\s This happiness of knowing that God has erased the record of our sins is also for the non-Jews. Remember that it was before
Abraham was circumcised, when he was still in effect a non-Jew, that God did that. He later received circumcision simply as a
sign of God having erased the record of his sins because of his faith. The result was that he became a spiritual father of all
who believe in God as he did, whether they are circumcised or not.
\p
\v 9 As for our being happy \add because God has erased the record of our
sins\add*, ◄it is not something that \add only\add* we Jews \add can
experience\add*.\f + \ft Or: is \f* it \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* something that \add only\add* we Jews
\add can experience\add*?► \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* \add No, it is\add* also something that
non-Jews\add can experience\add* \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f*. \add What is written in the
Scriptures\add*, that it was because Abraham trusted \add in God\add* that the record of his sins was erased
{\add God\add* erased the record of his sins}, \add also shows that this is
true\add*. 
\v 10 ◄\add Think about\add* when \add God erased the record of Abraham's
sins\add*.\f + \ft Or: When \f* did \add God erase the record of Abraham's sins\add*?► \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* ◄Consider whether
\add it happened\add* after someone circumcised \add Abraham to mark him as one who belonged to
God\add*, or before someone circumcised him.\f + \ft Or:  \f*\add Did it happen\add* after
\add Abraham was\add* circumcised \add to be marked as one who belonged to
God\add*, or before he was circumcised?► \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* It happened before he was circumcised, not after he was circumcised.
\v 11  \add Many years later, God commanded that\add* Abraham \add be\add* circumcised. Abraham's accepting that ritual simply
showed \add that he knew that God had accepted him\add*. \add He knew that
God\add* had \add erased the record of his sins\add* because he trusted
\add in God\add* while he was still, \add in effect, a non-Jew because\add* he had not been circumcised.
\add So we can understand that\add* Abraham became ◄a spiritual ancestor\f + \ft Or: like \f* an ancestor► to
\add all\add* of us whose record of sins has been erased {whose sins
\add God\add* has erased the record of} because we believe \add in God's promise, even though some of
us\add* are not circumcised. 
\v 12 Likewise, Abraham is the \add spiritual\add* ancestor of all us Jews who are not merely circumcised but who, more
importantly, \add believe in God's promise\add* as our ancestor Abraham did, even before he was circumcised.
\s Romans 4:13-17a 
\s It was because Abraham trusted in God that God erased the record of his sins and promised him many blessings. So what God
promised is guaranteed to all, both Jews and non-Jews, who trust in God as Abraham did.
\p
\v 13 God promised Abraham and his descendants that they would receive
\add the blessings that he promised to give to the people in\add* the world. But when he promised that, it was not because
Abraham \add obeyed\add* the laws \add that God later gave to Moses\add*. Instead, it was because Abraham believed
\add that God would do what he promised that he would do\add*. As a result, God erased the record of his sins.
\v 14-15 If \add we think that\add* it is those who \add obey God's\add* laws who will receive
\add what he has promised\add*, it is useless \add for us to think that he will erase the record of our sins just because
we\add* trust in him. And it is pointless \add for us to think that he will give us what
he\add* promised \add just because\add* we trust in him. \add Remember
that\add* it is \add stated\add* in God's law \\f + \\ft personification \\f* \add that\add* he will punish
\add people who do not perfectly obey them\add*, and remember that wherever \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* laws exist,
\add people\add* disobey them \\f + \\ft litotes \\f*. 
\v 16 So it is because \add we\add* trust \add in God that we will receive the things that he has
promised\add*. \add It is not because we perfectly obey God's laws. He
wants\add* ◄to \add erase the record of our sins\f + \ft Or: to \f* declare us no longer
guilty\add*► without our earning it. As a result, what God now promises, he guarantees to give to all people who are
\add Abraham's spiritual\add* descendants. \add He promises to do that not only for us Jewish
believers\add*, who \add have\add* God's laws \add and trust in him as Abraham
did\add*, but also for those \add non-Jews who do not have God's laws
but\add* who trust \add in him\add* as Abraham did. Abraham is the
\add spiritual\add* ancestor of all of us \add believers\add*. 
\v 17 What is written {What \add Moses\add* wrote} \add in the Scriptures about what God promised Abraham shows that this is
true\add*. \add God said to him\add*, “It is in order that you\add (sg)\add* may be the ancestor of many ethnic groups that I
have appointed you.” 
\s Romans 4:17b-22 
\s It was because Abraham confidently believed God's promise to give him many descendants, when there was no physical basis for
his hoping that this would happen, that God erased the record of his sins.
\p God \add guaranteed that he would give Abraham many descendants\add*. Abraham confidently believed that God
\add would do that\add*, 
\v 18 even though there was no physical reason for him to hope \add that he would have descendants, because he and his wife
were too old to bear children\add*. But God is the one who causes dead people to live again, and who talks about things that do
not yet exist as already existing. \add God said to Abraham\add*, “You will have so many descendants that they will be
\add as impossible to count as the stars\add*.” And Abraham believed that, and he believed that he would become the ancestor of
many ethnic groups. 
\v 19 He did not doubt \add that God would do what he promised\add*, even though he knew that his body was already
\add as incapable of begetting children as if he were\add* dead \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* because he was about a hundred years old. And
\add even though he realized that\add* Sarah had never been able to become pregnant \\f + \\ft idiom \\f*,
\v 20 he did not doubt at all that God \add would do what he had\add* promised. Instead, he trusted
\add in God\add* more\f + \ft Or: very \f* strongly, and he thanked God \add for what God was going to
do\add*. 
\v 21 He was also convinced {very sure} that the thing that God promised, God was able to do.
\v 22 And that is the reason that the record of his sins was erased
{\add God\add* erased the record of his sins}. 
\s Romans 4:23-25 
\s The words about God erasing the record of Abraham's sins were written also to assure us who believe in God.
\p
\v 23 The words \add in the Scriptures\add*, “The record of his sins was erased
{\add God\add* erased the record of his sins},” are not only about Abraham.
\v 24 They were also written {\add They\add* also wrote that} for us whose record of sins would be erased
{\add God\add* would erase}. They were written {\add They\add* wrote it} for us who believe
\add God\add*, the one who caused our Lord Jesus to become alive again after he died.
\v 25 Jesus allowed \add men\add* to execute \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* him so that \add God could
forgive\add* our evil deeds. And \add God\add* caused Jesus to live again because
\add God wanted to show that because of the death of Jesus he was able
to\add* erase the record of our sins.
