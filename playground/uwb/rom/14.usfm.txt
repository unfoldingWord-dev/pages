\c 14  
\s Romans 14:1-4 
\s Accept those who are not sure whether they are permitted to do certain things. Anyone who thinks that it is all right to eat
all kinds of food must not despise those who do not think that, and those who do not think that it is all right to eat certain
foods must not condemn those who do, because God has accepted them.
\p
\v 1 Accept those who are not sure \add whether God will permit them to do certain things some people think are
wrong\add*. But \add when you accept them\add*, do not argue with them about what they think\f + \ft Or: their \f* opinions.
\v 2 Some people believe that they may eat all \add kinds of food\add*. Others
believe\add that God does not want them to eat certain things, so
they\add* believe that they may not eat meat. 
\v 3 Anyone who \add thinks that it is all right to\add* eat \add all kinds of
food\add* must not despise those who \add think it is\add* not \add all right
to\add* eat \add all kinds of food\add*. Anyone who \add thinks it
is\add* not \add all right to\add* eat \add all kinds of food\add* must not ◄condemn\f + \ft Or: say \f* that
\add God\add* will punish► those who \add think that it is all right
to\add* eat \add all kinds of food\add*, because God himself has accepted those people.
\v 4  \add God is the master of us all, so\add* ◄\add he is the one who will decide whether those people have done wrong!\f + \ft Or: who \f*
are you to decide whether they have done wrong\add*?► \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* \add Therefore\add*, you have no right \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* to condemn those who
eat everything, because they are \add also God's servants! And just
like\add* it is the servants' own master who accepts or condemns \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* his servants,
\add it is God who accepts or condemns us\add*. And \add believers\add* will be accepted
\add by\add* the Lord {\add the Lord\add* will accept \add believers\add*}
\add regardless of whether they eat meat or not\add*, because he is able to keep them
\add trusting in him\add*. 
\s Romans 14:5-9 
\s Each person should be fully convinced about observing special days, thinking and deciding for himself and not for others. We
should try to please God by everything we do. 
\p
\v 5 Some people regard certain days as \add holy\add* and think that the other
\add days\add* are not \add holy\add*. Other people regard all days as
\add equally suitable for worshipping God\add*. Each person should be ◄fully convinced\f + \ft Or: sure \f*►
\add about such matters\add*, thinking and deciding for himself \add and not for
others\add*. 
\v 6 As for those who believe that they should worship on \add a
certain\add* day \add of the week\add*, it is to \add honor\add* the Lord
\add that they worship on that day\add*. And as for those who \add think that it is all right
to\add* eat \add all kinds of food\add*, it is to \add honor\add* the Lord
\add that they eat those foods\add*, as is clear from their thanking God
\add for the food that they eat\add*. As for those who abstain from
\add eating certain kinds of\add* food, it is to \add honor\add* the Lord that they do not eat
\add those foods\add*, and they also thank God \add for the food that they do eat. So doing either of those things is not wrong
in itself\add*. 
\v 7 None of us should live \add merely\add* to \add please\add* ourselves, and none of us
\add should choose when or how we will\add* die, \add merely\add* to
\add please\add* ourselves. 
\v 8 While we live, it is the Lord whom we belong to \add and should be trying to please, and not just
ourselves\add*. And when we die, it is the Lord whom we should \add be trying to
please\add*. So, while we live and also when we die, we should be trying to please the Lord to whom we
belong\add , not just ourselves\add*, 
\v 9 because the very purpose for which Christ died and became alive again is that he might be Lord whom all people should try
to please, both of those who have already died and of those who are still living.
\s Romans 14:10-12 
\s You should neither condemn nor despise your fellow believers who believe differently about religious regulations than you
do, because it is God who will say whether he approves of what we have done.
\p
\v 10 ◄It is disgraceful that you \add who practice certain religious
regulations\add* say that God will punish your fellow believers \add who do not practice those
regulations\add*!\f + \ft Or: Why \f* do you \add who practice certain religious
regulations\add* say God will punish your fellow believers \add who do not practice such
regulations\add*?► \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* \add I say this because the time will come
when\add* all of us will stand before God in order that he will say whether or not he approves \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f*
\add of what we have done\add*. So you \add who do not practice such
regulations\add*, ◄should not despise your fellow believers \add who practice
them\add*!\f + \ft Or: why \f* do you despise your fellow believers \add who practice
them\add*?► \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* 
\v 11  \add We know this\add* because it is written {\add a prophet\f + \ft Or: Isaiah \f*\add* wrote}
\add what God has said\add*: 
\q Everyone will bow down before me! That is as \add certain as the fact
that\add* I live \\f + \\ft idiom \\f*! Everyone \\f + \\ft synecdoche \\f* will acknowledge \add that because I
am\add* God, I have the \add right to judge and punish people\add*!
\p
\v 12 So \add it is clear that\add* it is God who will decide \add whether or not he approves
of\add* what each of us has done. 
\s Romans 14:13-18 
\s Instead of condemning each other, decide not to do anything that might lead your fellow believer to sin by following your
example and which would then cause others to speak evil of you. 
\p
\v 13 Since \add it is God who will judge everyone\add*, we must stop saying that
\add God should\add* punish some of our fellow believers! Instead, you\f + \ft Or: we \f* should decide that you\f + \ft Or: we \f* will not do anything that
would \add be an example that might cause\add* fellow believers to stop trusting in God \\f + \\ft doublet \\f*.
\v 14 I am absolutely certain \\f + \\ft doublet \\f* because of \add my close relationship
with\add* \f + \ft (OR, \add my belonging to\add*) \f* the Lord Jesus that there is nothing that by itself is wrong
\add to eat\add*. But if people think it is wrong to eat something, then to them it is wrong to eat it.
\add So you should not encourage them to eat it\add*. 
\v 15 If you \add eat\add* food \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* that anyone for whom Christ died
\add thinks that it is wrong to eat, that person might be encouraged\add*
{\add you might be encouraging that person\add*} \add to do something that he believes is wrong. As a result, you might cause
that\add* fellow believer \add to stop trusting in God\add*. He would thus be ruined
\add spiritually\add* just because you have stopped behaving as one who loves
\add others should behave!\add* 
\v 16 Similarly, do not \add do something that you think is\add* good if,
\add as a result, your fellow believer would sin and then\add* others would speak evil
\add of you who say that you are Christians\add*. 
\v 17 Letting God rule our lives \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* does not mean \add that we must obey regulations
about\add* eating or drinking \add something!\add* Instead, \add it means we
must\add* live righteously, \add act\add* peacefully \add towards
others\add*, and be joyful by \add the power of\add* the Holy Spirit.
\v 18 Those who serve Christ \add by acting\add* in such ways please God, and others will also respect them.
\s Romans 14:19-23 
\s Try to do what will help fellow believers to be at peace with each other and to grow spiritually. Do not destroy what God
has done in others' lives as a result of your eating certain things.
\p
\v 19 So we should always eagerly try to \add live in a way that will
cause\add* peace \add among fellow Christians\add*, and we should try to do what will help each other to mature
\add spiritually\add*. 
\v 20 Do not destroy what God has done \add in the life of any believer\add* just because of
\add your eating certain kinds of\add* food \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* \add which that person considers wrong to eat!
God\add* permits us to eat every \add kind of food\add*. But if, by your eating
\add certain kinds of food\add*, you encourage another person to sin
\add by doing what he believes is wrong\add*, you are doing wrong.
\v 21 It is good neither to eat meat nor to drink wine, nor \add to do anything else at any time if
it\add* will cause one of your fellow believers to stop trusting in God.
\v 22 Let God tell you \add what things are right for you to do, but do not try to force others to accept what you believe. God
is\add* pleased with those who do what they know is right and as a result do not feel guilty
\add concerning what they have done\add*, \add because they have done
only\add* those things that they believe are right. 
\v 23 But some believers are not certain \add that God will approve of their eating a certain kind of
food\add*. So if they eat it, \add they think that God will punish\add* them. And they
\add truly\add* will be punished {\add God truly\add* will punish them}, because
\add they have done things that they\add* believe \add are not right\add*. Those who do anything without being certain
\add that God considers it to be right\add* are sinning.
