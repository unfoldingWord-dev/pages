\c 2  
\s Romans 2:1-5 
\s Any one of you Jews who condemns non-Jews for doing evil will be condemned by God, because you also do the same evil things.
\p
\v 1  \add God will severely punish non-Jewish people who habitually do evil deeds, because he has clearly revealed that he is
angry with them\add*. So, \add when God judges people\add*, he will not excuse any one of you Jews
\add to whom I am writing\add*. You\add (sg)\add* say that \add God
should\add* punish \add non-Jews for doing evil deeds\add*. But when any one of you says that, it is yourself whom you are
saying that God should punish, because you\add (sg)\add* do \add some
of\add* the same \add evil\add* deeds \add that the non-Jews do\add*.
\v 2 We know very well that God will judge and punish fairly \add non-Jewish\add* people who do such
\add evil\add* deeds. 
\v 3 So, you who \add say God should punish\add* others for doing evil deeds yet you do evil deeds yourself, ◄you should
certainly not think that you yourself will be able to escape from being punished by God!/do you think that you yourself will be
able to escape from being punished by God?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* 
\v 4 And you should not say, “God is acting very tolerantly and patiently toward me,
\add so I do not need to turn away from my sin\add* \f + \fr doublet \f*.” ◄You should realize that God is acting in a kind manner
\add toward you\add* in order to encourage you\add (sg)\add* to turn away from your sinful behavior!/Do you not realize that
God is acting in a kind manner \add toward you\add* in order to encourage
you\add (sg)\add* to turn away from your sinful behavior?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*
\v 5 But instead, by your stubbornly refusing to turn away from your sinful behavior \f + \fr doublet \f*, you are causing \f + \fr metaphor \f* God to punish
you even more severely. \add He will do that\add* at the time when he shows that he is angry and judges people fairly.
\s Romans 2:6-11 
\s Because God is not influenced by a person's status, he will recompense each person according to what that person has done.
\p
\v 6 God will recompense everyone according to \add what they deserve
for\add* what they have done. 
\v 7  \add Specifically\add*, some people, by persevering in doing good deeds, strive to be highly honored
\add by God\add* \f + \fr doublet \f* and to receive a life that will not end. \add God will reward them by enabling
them\add* to live forever. 
\v 8 But some people act in a selfish way and refuse to believe that
\add what God says is\add* true, and they do the things that \add God
says\add* are wrong. \add God will\add* punish them very severely [DOU, MTY].
\v 9 He will cause everyone who habitually does evil deeds to suffer greatly,
\add with the result that they will become severely\add* distressed \f + \fr doublet \f*. This certainly will happen to the Jews
\add who refuse to accept God's message, because God gave them the privilege to be his special
people\add*, but it will also happen to the non-Jews. 
\v 10 But \add God will\add* greatly reward spiritually [MET, DOU] every person who habitually does good deeds. He will
\add certainly\add* do this for the Jews \add because God chose them as his special
people\add*, but he will also do it for the non-Jews. 
\v 11 God \add will do this fairly\add*, because people's status does not influence him.
\s Romans 2:12-16 
\s All non-Jews will be eternally separated from God for their sin and all Jews will be condemned for their sin, since it is
only those who have continually obeyed his laws whom God will justify.
\p
\v 12 Although \add non-Jews do not have\add* the laws that \add God gave to
Moses\add*, all \add non-Jews\add* who sin will be eternally separated from God. He will
\add not consider whether or not they knew\add* the laws that he
\add gave to Moses\add*. And all the \add Jews\add* who have sinned in spite of knowing the laws that
\add God gave to Moses will also be punished\add* {\add God will also punish
them\add*}. \add They will be punished for disobeying\add* God's laws.
\v 13  \add It is right for them to be punished\add* {\add God to punish
them\add*} \add because\add* it is not those who \add merely\add* know God's laws whom he considers to be righteous. On the
contrary, it is only those who continually have obeyed \add all\add* ◄of
\add God's\add* laws/of the laws that \add God gave to Moses\add*► ◄whom God will consider righteous/whose record of sins God
will erase►. 
\v 14 Whenever the non-Jews, who do not have the laws \add God gave to
Moses\add*, naturally obey those laws, \add they prove that\add* they have a law within their own minds, even though they do
not have the laws \add God gave to Moses\add*. 
\v 15 They show that they know in their own minds what God \add commands in
his\add* laws \f + \fr metaphor \f*, as each person in his very own conscience either accuses or excuses/defends
\add his behavior\add*. 
\v 16 God \add will punish them\add* at the time when he will judge people according to what they have thought and done. He
will judge them \add even\add* for the things that they have done secretly. He will judge people by
\add authorizing\add* Christ Jesus \add to judge them\add*. This is
\add what I tell people when\add* I preach the good message to them.
\s Romans 2:17-24 
\s It is disgusting that any one of you who has all the advantages of being a Jew would disobey God's law and, by doing so,
insult God. 
\p
\v 17  \add Now I have something to say to any one of\add* you \add Jews to whom I am
writing\add*: You\add (sg)\add* boast about yourself saying, “I am a Jew.”
You\add (sg)\add* trust \add that God will save you because you possess\add* the laws
\add that he gave to Moses\add*. You boast that \add you belong to\add* God.
\v 18 You know what God desires. Because you have been taught {\add people\add* have taught you}
\add God's\add* laws, you are able to know which things are right and to choose to do them.
\v 19 You are certain that you \add are able to\add* show \add God's truth to
non-Jews\add*, as guides \add show the road\add* to those who are blind \f + \fr metaphor \f*. You are certain that by what you say you can
show God's way to the \add non-Jews who do not understand it\add*, as a light shows the way to
\add those who walk in\add* the darkness [MET, DOU]. 
\v 20  \add You are certain that you\add* can instruct/correct \add non-Jews, whom you
consider\add* foolish \add because of their not understanding God's
message\add*. Because you have in \add God's\add* laws a \add written\add* expression of true knowledge \f + \fr hendiadys \f*, you are certain
that you can teach \add people who, being like\add* children, do not know
\add God's truth\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f*. 
\v 21  \add Since you claim that you have all these advantages because you are a
Jew\add*, ◄it is disgusting that you who teach other people \add that they should obey the laws God gave
Moses\add* do not \add obey the laws that you\add* yourself teach!/why is it that you who teach other people
\add that they should obey the laws God gave Moses\add* do not \add obey the laws that
you\add* yourself teach?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* You who preach that people should not steal things, ◄it is disgusting that you yourself steal
things!/why do you yourself steal things?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* 
\v 22 You who command people not to have sexual relations with someone to whom they are not married, ◄it is disgusting that it
you commit adultery yourself!/why do you commit adultery yourself?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* You who detest idols, ◄it is disgusting that you rob
temples \add where people worship idols\add*!/why do you rob temples
\add where people worship idols\add*?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* 
\v 23 You who boast saying, “\add I have God's\add* laws,” ◄it is disgusting that you disobey those same laws!/why do you
disobey those same laws?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* As a result you are insulting God!
\v 24  \add You must not be like our ancestors, about whom\add* were written
\add these words in the Scriptures:\add* “The non-Jews speak evil about God because of
\add the evil actions of\add* many of you \add Jews\add*.” They non-Jews say God must be a hypocrite if he condones the
behavior of people like you. 
\s Romans 2:25-29 
\s God will consider non-Jews acceptable to him if they obey his laws, and such non-Jews will declare God is right in
condemning those who disobey his laws, because it is only those who are changed inwardly who are true Jews and acceptable to
God. 
\p
\v 25 Any one of you who \add is\add* circumcised \add to show that he belong to
God\add* can benefit from that if he obeys the laws \add God gave to
Moses\add*. But if you\add (sg), a circumcised person\add*, disobey
\add God's\add* laws, \add God will consider that\add* you who are circumcised are no better
\add in God's sight\add* than\add someone who is\add* not circumcised.
\v 26 ◄This means that God will certainly consider that even \add non-Jews who
are\add* not circumcised can become his people if they obey the things that he commanded in his laws./So will not God consider
that even \add non-Jews who are\add* not circumcised can ◄become his people/become acceptable to him► if they obey the things
that he commanded in his laws?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* 
\v 27  \add If any one of\add* you disobeys God's laws, even though
\add you(sg) have\add* the Scriptures and even though someone has circumcised you {you are circumcised}
\add God will punish you\add*. And those people who are not circumcised, but who obey God's laws,
\add will declare that God is right\add* when he says that he will punish you.
\v 28 It is not those who perform rituals \add to show they are God's
people\add* who are \add true\add* Jews, and it is not being circumcised in their bodies
\add that causes God to accept them\add* \f + \fr metonymy \f*. 
\v 29 On the contrary, we whom \add God has changed\add* inwardly are
\add true\add* Jews \f + \fr metonymy \f*. And \add God has accepted us because we have allowed
God's\add* Spirit to change our hearts, not because we perform rituals. Even if
\add other\add* people will not praise us, God will praise us.
