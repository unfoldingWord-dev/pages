\c 12  
\s Romans 12:1-2 
\s I appeal to you that you present yourselves to God by making yourselves like living sacrifices, which is the appropriate way
to serve him. Do not let anything non-Christian determine how you act, but instead let God change your way of thinking.
\p
\v 1 My fellow believers, since God has acted mercifully \add toward
you\add* in so many ways, I appeal to \add all of\add* you that you present yourselves \f + \ft synecdoche \f*
\add to him by making yourselves like\add* holy sacrifices \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\add Make yourselves sacrifices\add* that he is pleased with, sacrifices that are living\f + \ft Or: alive \f*,
\add not ones that are dead\f + \ft Or: killed \f*. Since God has done so much for
you\f + \ft Or: us \f*\add*, this is the \add only\add* appropriate way to serve him.
\v 2 Do not let anything non-Christian determine how you should act. Instead, let God change your
\add way of life\add* by making your way of thinking new, in order that you may know what he wants you to do. That is, you will
know what is good, and you will know what pleases\add God\add*, and you will know how to be all that he wants you to be.
\s Romans 12:3-8 
\s Do not think about yourselves more highly than you should. Instead, think about yourselves sensibly, in a way that
corresponds to the abilities that God has given to you because you trust in Christ. May we do diligently and cheerfully what
God has given us ability to do. 
\p
\v 3 Because God has kindly appointed me \add to be his apostle\add*, which I did not deserve, I say this to every one of you:
Do not let what you think about yourselves exceed what is right for you to think! Instead, think
\add about yourselves\add* in a sensible way that \add corresponds to the
abilities\add* that God has given you \add because\add* you trust
\add in Christ\add*. 
\v 4 Although a person has one body, it consists of many parts. All of the parts are needed
for\add the body\add*, but they do not all function the same way.
\v 5 Similarly we, \add although we are\add* many, are \add united
into\add* one group because of our relationship with Christ, and we belong to one another.
\add So no one should act as though he\add* needed by God more\add than the
others!\add* 
\v 6  \add Instead\add*, since each one of us can do various things that differ according to the abilities that
\add God has\add* given to us, \add we should do them diligently and
cheerfully!\add* Those whom \add God has enabled\add* to speak messages from him
\add should speak\add* what corresponds to what they believe \add God told
them\add*. 
\v 7  \add Those whom God has enabled\add* to serve \add others\add* should do that.
\add Those whom God has enabled\add* to teach \add his truth\add* should do that.
\v 8 Those \add whom God has enabled to\add* encourage\f + \ft Or: exhort \f* \add his
people\add* should do that. Those who share \add their goods\f + \ft Or: money \f* with
others\add* should do it sincerely\f + \ft Or: generously \f*. Those who govern \add the
congregation\f + \ft Or: others\add* \f* should do it wholeheartedly. Those who help the needy should do it cheerfully.
\s Romans 12:9-18 
\s Love others sincerely in the various ways in which you act toward them.
\p
\v 9  \add The way you must love people is to\add* love them sincerely! Hate what is evil! Continue to eagerly do what
\add God considers to be\add* good! 
\v 10 Love one another as members of the same family do; and in regard to honoring one another, you should be the first
ones\f + \ft Or: eager \f* to do it! 
\v 11 Do not be lazy. \add Instead\add*, be eager \add to serve God! Be enthusiastic
as\add* you serve the Lord! 
\v 12 Rejoice because you are confidently awaiting \add what God will do for
you!\add* When you suffer, be patient! Keep praying and never give up!
\v 13 If any of God's people lacks anything, share with them \add what you
have!\add* Readily take care of \add travelers who need a place to
stay\add*! 
\v 14  \add Ask God to\add* be kind to those who persecute you\f + \ft Or: cause you to suffer \f*
\add because you believe in Jesus! Ask him to\add* be kind to them; do not
\add ask him to\add* cause bad things to happen to them. 
\v 15 If someone is joyful, you should rejoice also! If someone is sad, you should also be sad!
\v 16 Desire for others what you desire for yourselves \f + \ft Or: Live harmoniously with each other \f*! Do not do things because you
want to be \add famous!\add* Instead, be content to do \add tasks that others consider that
only\add* unimportant people do \f + \ft Or: \add to associate with unimportant\add* people \f*. Do not consider yourselves wise.
\v 17 Do not do evil \add deeds\add* to anyone \add who has done\add* evil to you. Act in a way that all people will recognize
as good! 
\v 18 Live peacefully with other people whenever it is possible, to the extent that you
\add can control the situation\add*. 
\s Romans 12:19-21 
\s Instead of avenging yourselves, allow God to avenge you; and instead of being overcome by evil done to you, overcome evil
deeds by doing good to those who do evil to you, because this is what the Scriptures command.
\p
\v 19  \add My fellow believers\add* whom I love, do not do evil in return when people do evil to you! Instead, allow
\add God\add* to punish them \f + \ft metonymy \f*, because it is {someone has} written
\add in the Scriptures that\add* the Lord\add said\add*, "'It is my responsibility to take revenge; I am the one who will
punish \add people who do evil to you\add* \f + \ft doublet \f*,' says the Lord."
\v 20 Instead of \add doing evil to those who have done evil to you\add*,
\add do as the Scriptures teach\add*: "If your\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* enemies are hungry, feed them! If they are thirsty, give them
something to drink. By doing that, you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* will cause them to feel ashamed
\add and perhaps they will change their attitude toward you\add* \f + \ft idiom \f*."
\v 21 Do not let evil \add deeds that others have done to you\add* overcome
you\add \f + \ft singular \f* by making you do evil to them!\add* \f + \ft personification \f* Instead, overcome their evil
\add deeds\add* by \add doing\add* good \add deeds to them\add*!
