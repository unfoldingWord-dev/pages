\s Romans 7:1-6 
\s You know that after people die they are freed from being required to obey any law. Similarly, God has freed us from being
required to obey all the Jewish rituals and laws. 
\p
\v 1 My fellow believers, you know about laws. So ◄you certainly know \f + \ft Or: I want you to remember \f* that people have to obey
laws \f + \ft personification \f* \add only\add* while \add they are\add* alive.\f + \ft Or: do \f* you not know that people have to obey laws \f + \ft personification \f*
\add only\add* while \add they are\add* alive?► \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* 
\v 2 For example, a woman is required by the law {the law requires a woman}
\add to obey and be faithful to her husband\add* as long as he is alive. But if her husband dies, she is
freed\add from having to\add* {\add no longer has to\add*} \add obey\add* the law about
\add remaining married to\add* her husband. 
\v 3 Therefore, a woman will be called {people will call a woman} an adulteress if she lives with another man while her husband
is alive. But if her husband dies, she no longer \add has to obey\add* that law. Then she will not be an adulteress if she
marries another man. 
\v 4 Likewise, my fellow believers, \add just like people are free from having to obey any law after they
die\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, you \add and I\add* have been freed {\add God\add* has freed you
\add and me\add*} from having \add to obey\add* all the Jewish rituals and laws \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\add That is because it is as though\add* we died with Christ \add when he was
crucified\add*. Now you \add and I\add* belong to someone else \f + \ft metaphor \f*,
\add like a woman who marries again after her husband dies belongs to another
man\add*. Specifically, you \add and I\add* belong to \add Christ\add*, who has been raised from the dead {whom
\add God\add* has caused to live again after he died}, in order that we may live righteously \f + \ft idiom \f* to
\add honor\add* God. 
\v 5 When our self-directed nature \add controlled\add* us, desires
\add that led us to\add* sin were acting in our bodies. \add Those desires were increased because of our knowing
God's\add* laws \f + \ft personification \f*. As a result \add we did evil things\add* \f + \ft idiom \f*
\add that\add* caused us to be separated from God. 
\v 6 But now we are freed {free} from \add having\add* \add to obey all the
Jewish\add* rituals—\add it is as though\add* we have died. The result is that now we are not controlled by those rituals
{those rituals do not control us now}. So we serve God, not by \add having to
obey\add* those rituals, which is the old way, but in the new way, as
\add God's\add* Spirit \add helps us to serve him\add*. 
\s Romans 7:7-12 
\s My reply to the objection that the laws of Moses are evil because they cause us to sin is that the laws are holy and good;
what the laws do are simply to reveal that what we are doing is sinful.
\p
\v 7  \add Someone might object\add*, saying, “◄The laws \add that God gave
Moses\add* must be evil \add if our sinful desires\add* are increased because of our knowing those laws. \f + \ft metonymy \f*\f + \ft Or: Are \f* not the laws
\add that God gave Moses\add* evil \add if they stir up our sinful
desires\add*?►” [MTY, RHQ] \add I would reply\add* that they certainly are not
\add evil, even though our sinful desires are increased\add*. What I would reply is that I,
\add for example\add*, realized that \add what I was doing\add* was sinful only
because\add of what is written\add* {\add Moses wrote\add*} \add in\add* those laws. For example, I realized that coveting
\add is sinful\add* only because he wrote in those laws \f + \ft personification \f*, “You must not covet.”
\v 8 And because of what that commandment \add stated\add*, my sinful
\add desire to have things that belong to others\add* \f + \ft personification \f* caused me to covet in many ways.
\add Our desire to\add* sin is not stimulated \f + \ft metaphor \f* when there is no law
\add that prohibits our doing sinful things\add*. 
\v 9 Formerly, when I did not \add know\add* what God's laws \add required\add*, I used to live
\add without worrying about what I was doing\add*. But when I \add became aware that
God\add* commanded, \add “You must not covet\add*,” I suddenly realized \f + \ft personification \f* that I was sinning,
\v 10 and \add I realized that\add* I was separated from God. The laws that
\add I thought would enable me to\add* live \add eternally as a result of my obeying
them\add* caused me \add to realize that\add* I was separated from God!
\v 11  \add My desire to\add* sin found a way \f + \ft personification \f* to deceive me
\add by making me think wrongly that\add* I could keep \add on sinning and at the same time
obey\add* those laws \add enough so that I would live eternally\add*, and
\add thus it\add* caused me to be separated from God \f + \ft personification \f*. 
\v 12 So \add we conclude that\add* the laws \add that God gave to
Moses\add* are holy. What God commanded \add about not coveting, along with all the other things that he
commanded\add*, is also holy, and it is just and good. 
\s Romans 7:13 
\s My reply to the objection that God's law, being good, causes people to become spiritually dead is no, it is our desire to
commit sin that causes us to sin and become spiritually dead. 
\p
\v 13 So, \add if someone were to object\add* saying, “\add The laws that God gave
Moses\add*, which are good, resulted in my being separated from God!\f + \ft Or: did they result in my being separated from God? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*”
\add I would reply\add*, “Certainly they did not \add do that!\add*” But instead, those
\add laws\add*, which are good, stimulated \add my desire to\add* sin. I knew that the result was that I was separated from
God. And also, because I \add learned what God had\add* commanded,
\add I knew that\add* what I was doing was \add truly\add* sinful.
\s Romans 7:14-25 
\s The laws came from God's Spirit, but you and I are influenced by our sinful natures. We often do not do the things that we
desire, and we do the things that we detest because of a desire to sin that permeates us and prevents us from doing good,
unless Christ frees us from being controlled by these desires. 
\p
\v 14 We know that the laws \add that God gave Moses came from God's\add* Spirit. But as for me, I am
\add influenced by my\add* self-directed nature. \add It is as though\add* I have been forced to become a slave of
\add my desire to\add* sin \f + \ft metaphor \f*. 
\v 15 The things that I do, I \add often\add* \f + \ft hyperbole \f* do not understand. That is,
\add sometimes\add* \f + \ft hyperbole \f* it is \add the good things\add* that I want
\add to do\add* that I do not do. \add And sometimes\add* \f + \ft hyperbole \f* it is the
\add evil\add* things that I detest that I do. 
\v 16 Since I \add do\add* the \add evil\add* things that I do not want
\add to\add* do, I agree that the laws \add of God\add* are good.
\v 17 So, it is not that I do \add evil things because I wish to do
them\add*. Instead, \add I do sinful things because the desire to\add* sin
\add causes me to do them\add*. The \add desire to\add* sin in within\f + \ft Or: permeates \f* me \f + \ft personification \f*.
\v 18 I know that my self-directed nature will not \add let me\add* \f + \ft personification \f*
\add do\add* anything that is good. I know this because I want \add to do what is
good\add*, but I do not do what is good. 
\v 19 I do not do the good things that I want to do. Instead, it is evil things that I do not want to do that I do.
\v 20 Because I do \add evil things\add* that I do not want to do, it is not that I do
\add evil things because I want to\add*. Instead, \add I do them
because\add* my self-directed nature, which permeates me \f + \ft personification \f*, \add causes me to do
them\add*. 
\v 21 I find, then, that what always happens is that when I want to do what is good, there is an evil
\add desire\add* present within me that \f + \ft personification \f* \add prevents me from doing
good\add*. 
\v 22 With my new inner nature I like the laws of God very much.
\v 23 Nevertheless, I sense that there is a different force that is in my body\f + \ft Or: me \f* [PRS, SYN]. It is opposed to what with my
mind \add I desire to do\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, and it puts me inescapably under the control of \f + \ft metaphor \f* the sinful
\add desires\add* that I have \f + \ft synecdoche \f*. 
\v 24 ◄\add When I consider this\add*, I \add feel that I\add* am a very wretched person. I want someone to set me free from
the control of what my body \add desires\add*, in order that I might not be separated from God.\f + \ft Or: Will \f* someone set me free from
the control of what my body \add desires\add*, in order that I might not be separated from God?► \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\add I also think that what I have experienced is the same as what all believers
experience\add*. 
\v 25 I thank God that it is by Jesus Christ our Lord \add that we can be free from the control of what our bodies
desire\add*. So, \add with our minds, you and\add* I on the one hand want to obey God's laws.
\add But also\add*, \add you and\add* I \add often let\add* our sinful
\add desires control us\add* because of our self-directed nature.
