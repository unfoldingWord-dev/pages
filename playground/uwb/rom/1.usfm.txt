\v 1  \add I\add*, Paul, who serve Christ Jesus, \add am writing this
letter\add*. God chose me to be an apostle, and I was appointed by him {he appointed me} in order that
\add I should proclaim\add* the good message\f + \ft Or: the gospel \f* that \add comes from
him\add*. 
\v 2 Long before \add Jesus came to earth, God\add* promised \add that he would
reveal\add* this good message by means of what his prophets \add wrote\add* in the sacred Scriptures.
\v 3 This good message is \add about the one whom we know as\add* his Son. As to his Son's physical\f + \ft Or: human \f* nature, he was born a
descendant of \add King\add* David. 
\v 4 As to his divine nature, it was shown {\add God\add* showed} powerfully that he is God's own Son\f + \ft Or: God who became human \f*.
\add God\add* showed this by his Holy Spirit causing him to become alive again after he died. He is Jesus Christ our Lord.
\v 5 He is the one who appointed me, who did not deserve it, \add to
be\add* an apostle. He did that in order that \add many\add* among the non-Jews would honor
\add him\add* and would obey him as a result of their believing \add my\add*
\add message about him\add*. 
\v 6 You \add believers\add* who are living in Rome \add city\add* are included among those whom God has chosen to belong to
Jesus Christ. 
\v 7  \add I am writing this letter\add* to all of \add you\add* whom God loves and whom he has chosen
\add to become his\add* people. \add I pray that\add* God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord will
\add continue to\add* act kindly toward you and \add will continue
to\add* cause you to have \add inner\add* peace. 
\s Romans 1:8-15 
\s I thank God that people everywhere are talking about how you believers in Rome are trusting Jesus Christ. I pray that God
will permit me to visit you soon. I want you to know that I have longed to visit you, but things have always prevented me. I am
eager to proclaim the good message to you who are living at Rome also.
\p
\v 8 As I begin \add this letter\add*, I thank my God for all you
\add believers in Rome\add*. It is because of \add what\add* Jesus Christ
\add has done for us that\add* I \add am able to do that\add*. I thank him because your trusting
\add in Jesus Christ\add* is something that people all over \add the Roman
Empire\add* \f + \ft hyperbole \f* are talking about. 
\v 9 God, whom I devotedly serve as I \add proclaim to people\add* the good message concerning his Son, knows that I tell the
truth when I say that I always mention you whenever \f + \ft doublet \f* I pray
\add to God\add* \f + \ft hyperbole \f*. 
\v 10 I especially ask God that if he desires \add me to visit you\add*, somehow at last I shall be able to do so.
\v 11  \add I pray this\add* because I long to visit you to help you spiritually in order that you will become stronger
\add spiritually\add*. 
\v 12 I long to visit you in order that you and I might encourage each other
\add by means of our sharing with each other\add* how each of us trusts
\add in Jesus\add*. 
\v 13 My fellow believers, many times I planned to visit you. I certainly want you to know \f + \ft litotes \f* that.
\add But I have not been able to come to you because\add* I have been hindered
{\add things\add* have always prevented me} until the present time. I have wanted to come in order that I might help you to
mature spiritually \f + \ft idiom \f*, as \add I have helped people to mature
spiritually\add* in many other non-Jewish groups \f + \ft hyperbole \f*. 
\v 14 I feel obliged \add to proclaim the good message to all non-Jewish
people\add*, specifically to \add people who know\add* the Greek
\add language and culture\add* and to those who do not know it, to people who are educated and to those who are uneducated.
\v 15 As a result, what I have eagerly desired is that I might proclaim this good message to you who are living in Rome also.
\s Romans 1:16-17 
\s I very confidently proclaim the good message about what Christ has done, both to Jews and non-Jews, because by that message
God reveals his way of declaring all people righteous. 
\p
\v 16  \add That leads me to say that\add* I very confidently proclaim \f + \ft litotes \f* the good message
\add about what Christ has done\add*, because this good message is the powerful
\add means\add* that God \add uses\add* to save \add from the guilt of their
sins\add* all people who trust \add in what Christ has done for them\add*. Specifically, God first saves the Jews
\add who believe the good message\add*, and then he saves non-Jews.
\v 17 By means of this good message God reveals how he erases the record of people's sins \f + \ft Or: declares people no longer guilty
for having sinned); and his doing this is entirely because ( idiom ) they trust
\add in Christ. This is confirmed\add* by what \add a prophet long
ago\add* wrote \add that God said\add*, “Those whose record of sin
\add I\add* have erased\f + \ft Or: whom \add I\add* have declared no longer guilty for sin \f* because they trust
\add in me\add* will live \add forever\add*.” 
\s Romans 1:18 
\s God is making it clear to all Jewish people who are godless and wicked that he is angry with them.
\p
\v 18 From \add where God rules in\add* heaven he is making it clear to all
\add non-Jewish\add* people who show no respect for God and who do wicked things, that he is angry with them
\add and that they deserve to be punished\add* {\add that he would punish
them\add*} \f + \ft metonymy \f*. By means of \add their behaving\add* wickedly, they keep other people
\add from believing what they know\add* to be true \add about God\add*.
\s Romans 1:19-23 
\s Everyone can clearly know what God is like; so no one has a basis for saying, “We never knew about God.”
\p
\v 19  \add Everyone\add* can clearly know what God \add is like\add*, because God himself has revealed to everyone
\add what he is like\add*. 
\v 20  \add People\add* cannot see what God is like. But ever since he created the world, by means of what he created he has
clearly revealed what he is like. He has made clear to everyone that he has always been able to do very powerful deeds.
\add Therefore, we should recognize that\add* he is God, \add completely different from all that he
created\add*. So no one has a basis for saying\add , “We never knew about
God\add*.” 
\v 21 Although \add the non-Jews\add* knew what God \add is like\add*, they did not honor him as God, nor did they thank
\add him for what he had done\add*. But instead, they began to think foolish
\add things about him\add*, and they became unable to understand \f + \ft metaphor \f*
\add what he wanted them to know\add*. 
\v 22 Although they claimed that they were wise, they became foolish,
\v 23 and they refused to \add admit that\add* God is glorious and will never die. Instead, they made and worshipped idols
\add that resembled people who\add* will some day die, and \add then they made other idols that
resembled\add* birds and four-footed animals, and \add finally\add* they made idols that resembled reptiles.
\s Romans 1:24-27 
\s So God let the non-Jewish people feel compelled to do disgraceful things, which resulted in their dishonoring their bodies
sexually. He did this because they worshipped idols and things that were created instead of worshipping God. As a result of
both men and women having unnatural sexual relations, they have been punished as they deserve.
\p
\v 24 So God allowed \add the non-Jews\add* do immoral sexual things that they \f + \ft synecdoche \f* strongly desired, things
\add that their desires were compelling them to do\add*. As a result, they
\add began to\add* dishonor each other's bodies \add by their sexual
actions\add*. 
\v 25 Also, they \add chose to worship\add* false \add gods\add* instead of admitting\f + \ft Or: of choosing to believe \f* what is true
\add about\add* God. They worshipped and served things \add that
God\add* created instead of \add worshipping and serving God\add*, the one who created
\add everything. They did this even though\add* he\add deserves that those he
created\add* would forever praise him. Amen!\f + \ft Or: May \f* it be so! 
\p
\v 26 So, God allowed \add the non-Jews to do\add* shameful \add sexual\add* things that they
\add strongly\add* desired. As a result, many women did not have natural sexual relations
\add with their husbands\add* \f + \ft euphemism \f*. Instead, they were doing sexual actions with other women \f + \ft euphemism \f*.
\v 27 Similarly, \add many\add* men stopped having\f + \ft Or: did \f* not have natural sexual relations with women \f + \ft euphemism \f*. Instead, they
strongly desired to have sexual relations with other men. They committed
\add homosexual\add* acts with other men, acts that were shameful. As a result,
\add God has\add* punished them \add by sicknesses\add* in their bodies, which is what they deserve
\add because\add* they \add thought\add* wrongly \add that God would not punish them for doing
that\add*. 
\s Romans 1:28-32 
\s The result of God's letting people become obsessed by their own depraved thoughts was that they themselves began to do all
manner of evil things that God says are improper. They even approve of others doing such things.
\p
\v 28 Furthermore, because they decided that it was not \add worthwhile\add* to know God, he allowed their own worthless
thoughts \add to completely control them\add*. As a result, they began doing
\add evil\add* things that \add God says that people\add* should not do.
\v 29 They strongly desire to do all \add kinds of\add* unrighteous
\add deeds\add*. They strongly desire to do all \add kinds of\add* evil things
\add to others\add*. They strongly desire to possess things that
\add belong to others\add*. They strongly desire to harm \add others\add* in various ways.
\add Many non-Jews\add* are constantly envying \add other people.
Many\add* constantly desire to murder \add people. Many\add* constantly desire to cause strife
\add between people. Many\add* constantly desire to deceive \add others.
Many\add* constantly desire to speak hatefully \add about others\add* (OR,
\add to speak harmful things about others, things that are not true\add* \f*.
\add Many\add* gossip \add about others\add*. 
\v 30  \add Many\add* slander \add others. Many\add* act especially hatefully toward God.
\add Many\add* speak or act in an insulting way \add toward others.
Many\add* treat others contemptuously. \add Many\add* boast \add about themselves to others.
Many\add* invent new ways to do evil deeds. \add Many non-Jewish
children\add* disobey their parents. 
\v 31  \add Many non-Jews\add* act in other morally foolish ways.
\add Many\add* do not do what they promised \add others that they would do.
Many\add* do not \add even\add* love \add their own family members. And
many\add* do not act mercifully \add toward other people\add*. 
\v 32 Although they know that God has declared that those who do such things deserve to be killed, they not only habitually do
these \add kinds of evil\add* things, but they also approve of others who habitually do them.
