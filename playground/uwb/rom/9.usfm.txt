\c 9  
\s Romans 9:1-5 
\s I tell you very sincerely that I grieve greatly about most of my fellow Israelites having rejected Christ. I would be
willing to be separated from Christ if that would help them believe in him.
\p
\v 1  \add Now I would like to discuss the fact that most of my fellow Israelites have rejected
Christ\add*. Because of my relationship with Christ, I say completely truthfully
\add what I will now tell you\add*. I am not lying \f + \fr doublet \f*! My conscience confirms what I
\add say\add* because the Holy Spirit \add controls it\add*. 
\v 2  \add I tell you that\add* I grieve very greatly and deeply \f + \fr doublet \f*
\add about my fellow Israelites\add*. 
\v 3 I personally would be willing to let \add God\add* curse me
\add and, as a result, be separated\add* from Christ \add if that
would\add* help my fellow Israelites, my natural kinsmen, \add to believe in
Christ\add*. 
\v 4 We \add Jews\add* are \add Israelites, God's chosen\add* descendants of
\add Jacob\add*. \add God has always considered\add* us as his children \f + \fr metaphor \f*. It was to our ancestors
\add that he used to appear\add* gloriously \add while they were in the
desert\add*. It was with them that \add God made\add* covenants \add several
times\add*. It was to them \add that God\add* gave the laws \add at Mount
Sinai\add*. They were the ones \add to whom God showed how they should\add* worship him. They were the ones
\add to whom God\add* promised many things, \add especially that the Messiah would come from their
race\add*. 
\v 5 It was our ancestors, \add Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, whom God chose to found our
nation\add*. And, \add most importantly\add*, it was from us Israelites that the Messiah received his human nature.
\add Nevertheless, most of my fellow Israelites have rejected Christ\add*, who is the one who controls all things! He is God,
the one who is worthy that we praise him forever! This is true! (OR, Amen!)
\s Romans 9:6-13 
\s This does not prove that God has failed to do for Abraham what he promised, because, as Scripture illustrates, it is not all
who are naturally descended from Jacob or Abraham whom God considers to be his children, but it is those who were born as a
result of what God promised whom he considers his children. 
\p
\v 6  \add God promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, that their descendants would all inherit his
blessings\add*. But \add although most of my fellow Israelites have rejected
Christ\add*, that does not \add prove\add* that God has failed \add to
do\add* the things that he promised, because it is not all who are descended from Jacob and who
\add call themselves the people of\add* Israel whom \add God considers\add* to be truly his people.
\v 7 And it is also not all of Abraham's natural descendants that
\add God considers\add* to be his people. Instead, \add God considers only some of them to be Abraham's
children\add*. \add This agrees with what God told Abraham\add*: “It is Isaac,
\add not any of your(sg) other sons\add*, whom \add I\add* will consider
\add to be the true father of\add* your descendants.” 
\v 8 That means that it is not all the natural-born descendants \add of
Abraham\add* whom God\add considers as\add* his children. Instead it is those who were born as a result of
\add believing what God\add* promised whom \add he\add* considers to be his children.
\v 9  \add You know that what God\add* promised \add to Abraham\add* was this: “About this time
\add next year\add* Sarah \add your wife\add* will bear a son \add as a result of my
enabling\add* \f + \fr metonymy \f* \add her\add*.” \add So Abraham knew that it was not through Ishmael, the son that he already had, that God
would fulfill what he had promised him\add* (OR, \add that his true descendants would
come\add*). 
\v 10 And not only then did God show \add that he did not determine who would be his true children according to who their
ancestors were. He showed it again\add* when Rebecca conceived \add twins\add* by our ancestor Isaac.
\v 11-12 Before \add the twins, Jacob and Esau\add*, were born, when neither one had yet done anything good or bad,
\add God\add* said to Rebecca \add about the twins she was to bear\add*, “The older one shall later serve the younger one,
\add contrary to normal custom\add*.” \add God said this\add* in order that
\add we\add* might \add clearly\add* understand that what he purposed
\add for people\add* was according to what he himself determined. That is, people's
\add eternal destiny\add* does not depend on what they do. Instead, their destiny depends on
\add God\add*, the one who chooses them. 
\v 13 And \add this teaching is\add* ◄\add supported/shown to be
true\add*► \add by\add* what is written \add in the Scriptures\add* {what
\add a prophet\add* recorded} \add that God said\add*: “I favored Jacob,
\add the younger son\add*. I did not favor \f + \fr hyperbole \f* Esau, \add the older
son\add*.” 
\s Romans 9:14-18 
\s As the Scriptures indicate, God's choosing people depends not on their wishes or efforts. He helps whomever he wants to
help, and he makes stubborn whomever he wants to make stubborn. We cannot conclude that God is unjust in choosing the ones he
wants to choose. 
\p
\v 14  \add Someone\add* might say, “◄Is God unjust \add by choosing the ones he wants to choose?/I
think\add* that God is unjust \add by choosing the ones he wants to
choose!\add*►” \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* \add I would reply\add*, “\add He is\add* certainly not
\add unjust!\add*” 
\v 15 God told Moses, “I will pity and help anyone whom I choose \f + \fr doublet \f*!”
\v 16 So \add God chooses people\add*, not because they want \add God to choose
them\add* or because they try hard \add to do things so that he\add* will
\add accept them\add*. Instead he chooses people because he himself has mercy
\add on undeserving ones\add*. 
\v 17  \add Moses\add* recorded \f + \fr personification \f* \add that God had told\add* Pharaoh, “This is why I gave
you\add (sg)\add* authority \f + \fr metonymy \f*: It was in order that I might show
\add by how I oppose\add* you \add how exceedingly\add* powerful I am, and in order that people everywhere \f + \fr hyperbole \f* would hear
about me \f + \fr metonymy \f*.” 
\v 18 So \add we conclude that God\add* kindly helps the ones he wants to act kindly towards. But he makes stubborn the ones
\add such as Pharaoh\add* that he wants \add to make stubborn\add*.
\s Romans 9:19-29 
\s My reply to anyone's objection to this doctrine is that God has a right to carry out his purposes; he tolerated the people
who caused him to be angry, in order that he might disclose how gloriously he acts toward those on whom he intends to have
mercy. 
\p
\v 19  \add One of\add* you may \add object to this by\add* saying to me,
“\add Because God determines ahead of time everything that people do, that also implies that he wants us to do everything that
we do\add*. ◄No one has resisted what God has willed!/Who has resisted what God has willed?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* Therefore, ◄it would not be
right that God would still condemn \add a person for having sinned\add*!/why does God still condemn
\add a person for having sinned\add*?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*” 
\v 20  \add I would reply that since\add* you\add (sg)\add* are \add just
a\add* human being, ◄you do not \add have any right at all to\add* criticize
God!/\add who are you to\add* say that what God does is wrong?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*
\add As a potter is the one who creates a clay pot, God is the one who created
you\add*. ◄A clay pot \f + \fr metaphor \f* certainly would not \add have a right to
criticize\add* the potter by asking \f + \fr personification \f*, “Why did you\add (sg)\add* make me this way?”/Would a clay pot
\add have a right to criticize\add* the potter by asking \f + \fr personification \f*, “Why did
you\add (sg)\add* make me this way?”► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* 
\v 21 Instead, ◄the potter certainly has the right to \add take\add* some clay and from one lump
\add of clay\add* make one pot that people will honor and \add make
another\add* one for ordinary purposes \f + \fr metaphor \f*./does not a potter have the right to
\add take\add* some clay and from one lump \add of clay\add* make one pot that people will honor and
\add make another\add* pot for ordinary purposes?► [MET, RHQ] \add Similarly, God has the right to carry out what he purposes
for people\add*. 
\v 22 Although God desires to show that he is angry \add about sin\add*, and
\add although he desires to\add* make clear that he can powerfully
\add punish people who have sinned\add*, he tolerated very patiently the people \f + \fr metaphor \f* who caused him to be angry and who
deserved to be destroyed (OR, who were made to be destroyed). 
\v 23  \add God has been patient\add* in order that he might make clear how very wonderfully
\add he acts toward those\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f* whom he intended to act mercifully towards and whom he prepared ahead of time in order
that they might \add live\add* gloriously \add in heaven\add*. 
\v 24 That means us whom he chose—not only \add us\add* Jews but also non-Jews.
\v 25  \add These words that\add* Hosea wrote \f + \fr metonymy \f* that \add God\add* said also ◄show that God has the
right/\add support God's right\add*► \add to choose from among both Jews and
non-Jews\add* \f + \fr metonymy \f*: 
\q I will declare that many people who were not my people are now my people. I will declare that many people whom I did not
love \f + \fr hyperbole \f* before, I love now. 
\q
\v 26 And \add another prophet wrote\add*: 
\q What will happen is that in the places where \add God\add* told them before, “You are not my people,” in those same places
\add people\add* will declare truthfully that they are children of God, who is completely powerful.
\q
\v 27 Isaiah also exclaimed concerning the Israelites: 
\q Even though the Israelites are \add so many that no one can count them,
like\add* sand \add particles beside\add* the ocean, \add only\add* the small part of them will be saved
{\add God\add* will save \add only\add* the small part of them},
\v 28 because the Lord will punish completely and speedily the \add people who live in
that\add* land, as he said that he would do. 
\p
\v 29  \add Also, we can understand from what the prophet\add* Isaiah
said\add that God would not save\add* anyone if he did not show mercy,
\q If the Lord, who controls everything in heaven, had not mercifully allowed some of our descendants to survive, we would have
become like the people of the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, who were [SIM, DOU] completely destroyed.
\s Romans 9:30-33 
\s The non-Jews found the way by which God could declare them righteous. The Jews did not succeed in fulfilling what the Mosaic
laws require. Instead, they tried to find a way to be declared righteous by doing things in order that God would accept them.
\p
\v 30 ◄We must conclude this:/What shall we conclude?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* Although non-Jews did not search out
\add a way by which\add* God would erase the record of their sins, they found that way because they trusted
\add in what Christ did for them\add*. 
\v 31 But although \add the people of\add* Israel sought a basis
\add by which God would\add* erase the record of their sins, they did not succeed in
\add fulfilling the true purpose of the\add* laws \add that God gave to
Moses\add*. 
\v 32 The reason \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* \add that they did not succeed\add* is that they did not trust that
\add God would provide a way to save them\add*. Instead, they were trying to do certain things
\add in order that God would accept them. Because they did not expect the Messiah to die, the
Israelites\add* felt disgusted concerning \add Jesus' death, which is
like\add* the stone \f + \fr metaphor \f* on which people stumble. 
\v 33 This is what \add a prophet\add* predicted when he wrote these words
that\add God said about the Messiah\add*: 
\q Listen! I am placing in Israel \f + \fr metonymy \f* \add one who is like\add* a stone \f + \fr metaphor \f* on which people will stumble. What he does will
offend people \f + \fr doublet \f*. Nevertheless, those who believe in him will not be disappointed.
