\c 10  
\s Romans 10:1-4 
\s My deep desire and earnest prayer is that God will save the Jews, who do not understand how to seek him correctly.
\p
\v 1 My fellow believers, what I deeply desire and what I pray to God earnestly for is that he will save
\add my own people\add*, \add the Jews\add*. 
\v 2 I declare truthfully about them that although they zealously seek\f + \ft Or: very much want to know \f* God, they do not understand
\add how to seek\f + \ft Or: know \f* him correctly\add*. 
\v 3 They did not submit themselves to\f + \ft Or: accept \f* the way that God erases the record of people's sins. They did not
\add want to\add* recognize \add that way\add* because they wanted him to do it their own way.
\v 4 They wanted God to erase the record of their sins \add as a result of their obeying his laws.
But\add* because of what Christ has done, it is no longer necessary for
\add people to obey\add* the laws \add God gave Moses in order for the record of their sins to be
erased\add*. Now God will erase the record of sins of everyone who trusts
\add in what Christ has done\add*. 
\s Romans 10:5-13 
\s The message of Scripture is that those who confess publicly that Jesus is their Lord and who believe inwardly that God
raised Jesus from the dead will be saved, because God accepts people only because of their faith, Jews and non-Jews alike.
\p
\v 5 In regard to \add the old\add* way, Moses wrote \add concerning people who obey
God's\add* laws, “It is the people who have done \add perfectly\add* the things
\add that the laws require\add* who will gain \add eternal\add* life by
\add doing\add* them.” 
\v 6 But those whose record of sins God has erased as a result of their believing
\add in Christ\add* can say \add to anyone\add* \f + \ft personification \f* \add as Moses
said\add*, “You should not \add critically\add* say inwardly, ‘◄Someone will have to go up and enter heaven!\f + \ft Or: Who \f* will go up and
enter heaven?►’ \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*” That is to say, someone will have to \add go up
and\add* bring Christ down \add to bring the message of salvation to
us!\add* 
\v 7 “Or \add you should not say inwardly\add*, ‘◄Someone will have to go down and enter the place where
\add the spirits\add* of dead persons are!\f + \ft Or: Who \f* will go down and enter the place where
\add the spirits\add* of dead persons are?►’ \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*” That is to say, someone will have to
\add go down and\add* bring Christ up \add from there to bring the message of salvation to us. You should not say that because
Christ has already come down to save us, and has already risen from the
dead!\add* 
\v 8 But instead, \add those who believe in Christ\add* \f + \ft personification \f* can say what \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\add Moses also said\add*, “You\add (sg)\add* can find out about
\add God's\add* message very easily. You can speak \f + \ft metonymy \f* about it; you can think \f + \ft metonymy \f* about it.” This is the message that we
proclaim, that people must believe \add in Christ\add*. 
\v 9  \add This message is that\add* if anyone of you confesses\f + \ft Or: says \f* publicly that Jesus is Lord, and if
you\add (sg)\add* believe inwardly that God raised him from the dead\f + \ft Or: after he died \f*, you will be saved
{\add God\add* will save you}. 
\v 10 If people believe inwardly \add that Christ died and that God caused him to become alive
again\add* \f + \ft chiasmus \f*, the result is that \add God will erase the record of their
sins\add*. And \add for\add* those who state\f + \ft Or: declare \f* publicly \add that Jesus is their
Lord\add*, the result is that \add God\add* will save them. 
\v 11  \add It is written\add* {\add Isaiah wrote\add*} in the Scriptures \f + \ft personification \f*
\add about the Messiah\add*, “Whoever believes in him will not be disappointed.”
\v 12  \add God\add* treats the Jews and the non-Jews similarly. Because he is the same Lord for all people
\add who believe in him\add*, he abundantly \add blesses\add* all who ask him
\add to help\f + \ft Or: save \f* them\add*. 
\v 13 This is \add just like what the prophet Joel wrote\add*: “All those who ask the Lord
\add God\add* to save them will be saved {The Lord \add God\add* will save all those who ask him to save them}.”
\s Romans 10:14-17 
\s There may be those who object by saying, “If God does not send someone to preach to the Jews, they cannot ask Christ to save
them.” My reply to them is that God has sent people to preach about Christ to them, but most of the Jews have not accepted the
gospel. However, some Jews do believe in Christ, and many other people are indeed hearing the message.
\p
\v 14  \add In regard to the people of Israel rejecting the gospel, some people might object by
saying\add*, \f + \ft Or: \add This raises another problem about the Jews\add*: \f* “◄They certainly cannot ask
\add Christ\add* \add to help\f + \ft Or: save \f* them\add* if they have not \add first\add* believed
\add in him\add*!\f + \ft Or: How \f* can they ask \add Christ to help\f + \ft Or: save \f* them\add* if they have not
\add first\add* believed \add in him\add*?► \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* And ◄they certainly cannot believe
\add in him\add* if they have not heard about him!\f + \ft Or: how \f* can they believe
\add in him\add* if they have not heard about him?► \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* And ◄they certainly cannot hear
\add about him\add* if someone does not preach to them \add about
him\add*!\f + \ft Or: how \f* can they hear \add about him\add* if someone does not preach to them
\add about him\add*?► \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* 
\v 15 And those who preach to them \add about Christ\add*, ◄certainly cannot preach if they are not sent
\add by God\add* {if \add God\add* does not send them} \add to preach!\add*\f + \ft Or: how \f* can they preach if they are not sent
\add by God\add* {if \add God\add* does not send them} \add to preach\add*?► \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\add His sending messengers to them would be\add* just like it is written {like someone wrote}
\add in the Scriptures\add*, ‘The arrival \f + \ft metonymy \f* of those who preach the good message is wonderful!’”
\v 16  \add I would reply in this way to people who say such things: God has indeed sent people to preach the message about
Christ\add*. But not all \add the people of Israel\add* have paid attention to the good message!
\add It is like what\add* Isaiah said \add when he felt very discouraged\add*, “Lord, ◄it seems as if hardly anyone believed
what they heard us\add (exc)\add* preach!\f + \ft Or: has \f* anyone believed what they heard
us\add (exc)\add* preach?► \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*” 
\v 17 So then, \add I tell you that people\add* are believing \add in
Christ\add* as a result of hearing \add the message about him\add*, and people are hearing
\add the message\add* as a result of \add people\add* preaching \add about\add* Christ!
\s Romans 10:18-21 
\s In reply to a query of whether the Jews have heard or understood about Christ, I would say that, as is supported by the
Scriptures, they have heard it and should have understood it, because even the non-Jews, who were not searching for God,
understood it. 
\p
\v 18 But \add if someone were to\add* ask, “Have not \add the people of
Israel\add* heard \add the message about God?\add*” \add I would reply that
they\add* certainly \add have heard!\add* It is like\add what is written in the
Psalms\add*, 
\q \add The people living\add* all over the world [PRS, MTY] \add have seen the
stars\add*, and what they indicate \add about God's character has reached people living
in\add* the most remote places in the world \f + \ft doublet \f*! 
\p
\v 19 But \add someone might ask\add*, “\add Is it true that the people
of\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* Israel understood \add the message about Christ\add*?”
\add I would reply that certainly they understood it, but they rejected it! Remember
that\add* Moses was the first \add one who warned the people of Israel about disobeying God. He told them that God
said\add*, 
\q \add You consider that\add* the non-Jewish groups are not nations at all \f + \ft chiasmus \f*. But some of them
\add will believe in me, and I will bless them\add*. Then you will envy them. I will cause you to be angry with those people
whom \add you Jews think\add* do not understand \add my ways\add* \f + \ft irony \f*.
\q
\v 20 Remember also \add what God\add* said\add very\add* boldly to Isaiah:
\q The non-Jews who did not try to know\f + \ft Or: seek \f* me will surely find me \f + \ft doublet \f*!
\p I will surely reveal what I am like to those who did not ask for me!
\p
\v 21 But concerning \add the people of\add* Israel, \add Isaiah\add* tells
\add us that God said\add*: 
\q I have for a long time held out my arms to the people who disobeyed and rebelled against me,
\add in order\add* to invite them to return to me.
