\c 6  
\s Romans 6:1-14 
\s If someone were to say that perhaps we should continue to sin in order that God may continue to act more kindly toward us, I
would reply that we who ought to consider ourselves unresponsive to sinful desires should certainly not continue sinning. We
must keep remembering that it is as though our former sinful nature has ceased to function, and it is as though we have become
unresponsive to sinful desires, living in a new way. So do not let the desire to commit sin control you. Instead, present
yourselves to God to do righteous things. 
\p
\v 1 Someone might \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* say \add in reply to what I have written\add* that
\add since God acted kindly toward us\add* in a way we did not deserve
\add because we sinned\add*, perhaps we should continue to sin in order that he may continue to act even more kindly toward us
\add and keep on forgiving us\add*.\f + \ft Or: should we continue to sin in order that he may continue to act even more kindly toward us
\add and keep on forgiving us\add*? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* 
\v 2  \add I would reply\add*, No, certainly not! We \add ought to consider
that\add* our sinful desires \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add cannot make us do what they want us to
do\add*, \add just like we cannot make\add* a corpse do what we want it to do. So it is not right that we continue to sin!\f + \ft Or: how
can we continue to sin? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* 
\v 3 When we were baptized {\add asked someone to\add* baptize us} in order to show that we have a relationship with \f + \ft Or: are
united to \f* Jesus Christ, our \add being baptized was to declare that it was as
though\add* we died with Christ. \add I want\add* you to remember that!\f + \ft Or: Do you not know that? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 4 So, when we were baptized {someone baptized us}, \add it was as
though\add* we were buried with Christ. \add We were baptized\add* in order to indicate that
\add we would not let our sinful desires make us do what they want us to do, just like people cannot
make\add* a corpse \add do what they want it to\add* do \f + \ft metaphor \f*. We
\add were baptized\add* to \add signify that we would\add* continually conduct our lives in a new way, just like Christ was
caused to live again in a new way by the great \add power\add* of
\add God his\add* Father. 
\v 5 Because of our close relationship with Christ, we have \add separated ourselves from the former way in which we conducted
our lives\add*, just like he \add was separated from his physical life when
he\add* died \f + \ft metaphor \f*. But God will also certainly \add enable us to live in a new way, just like
he\add* enabled Christ to live again. 
\v 6 We must keep remembering that when Christ died on the cross \f + \ft metaphor \f*,
\add it was as though\add* our sinful nature \add died with him. It
has\add* lost its power to make us do what it wants us to do \f + \ft metaphor \f*. That happened in order that we would not do the sinful
\add things that our bodies\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, which desire to sin, want us to do, and in order that we would no longer have to sin
\f + \ft metaphor \f*, as slaves \add have to do what their masters want\add*. 
\v 7  \add We are, as it were, freed\add* {\add free\add*} \add from\add* sinful
\add desires\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add controlling us, just like\add* those who have died are free
\add from anything controlling them\add*. 
\v 8 Since \add it is as though\add* we died with Christ, we believe that we will continue to live with him.
\v 9 We know that since \add God\add* enabled Christ to live again after he died, Christ will never die again. Nothing will
ever be able to make him die again \f + \ft personification \f*. 
\v 10 When he died, he died once for \add people\add* who had sinned, and he will never die again; but in regard to his living
\add again now\add*, he lives in order to \add serve\f + \ft Or: honor \f*\add* God.
\v 11 Similarly, you must consider that \add it is as though\add* you have become
\add unable to do what your\add* sinful \add desires\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* want, as a corpse
\add is not able to do what anyone wants it to do\add*. You must also consider that because of your relationship to Christ
Jesus you are living \add in a new way\add* in order to \add serve\f + \ft Or: honor \f*\add* God.
\v 12 So, do not let the \add desire to\add* sin \f + \ft personification \f* control your bodies \f + \ft metaphor \f* with the result that you do the sinful things
that you desire to do. \add Remember that\add* your bodies will surely die,
\add but your spirits will never die\add*. 
\v 13 Do not let any of your body parts do wicked things, as \add you
did\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add when you were spiritually\add* dead. Instead, present yourselves to God as people who are alive
\add spiritually\add*. Present all your body parts to God, \add to allow
him\add* to use them to \add do\add* righteous things. 
\v 14 Do not let a \add desire to\add* sin control you \f + \ft personification \f*. The laws
\add that God gave Moses\add* did not enable you\add to stop sinning\add*. But
\add now\add* God controls you and kindly helps you \add not to sin\add*.
\s Romans 6:15-23 
\s If someone should conclude that people can sin now because they are not obligated to obey the Mosaic laws, I would say,
"Certainly not!" Instead, let your minds compel your bodies to act righteously.
\p
\v 15  \add I suppose that certain people might think about what I have just said and they
might\add* say \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*, "\add You say that\add* the laws \add God gave
Moses\add* did not \add enable us to stop sinning, but that God is
now\add* treating us kindly in ways we do not deserve. \add That seems to mean that God
permits\add* us to continue sinning.\f + \ft Or: \add Does that mean that God
permits\add* us to continue sinning? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*" My reply to that is no, we should certainly not continue
\add sinning\add*! 
\v 16  \add Slaves\add* have to obey\add what their masters command\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*
\add them to do\add*. I want you to remember this: Do you not know this?► \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* Similarly, if you present yourselves to
someone \add in order to\add* obey him, you will be the slaves \f + \ft metaphor \f* of the person you obey. Similarly,
\add if you have yielded yourselves to do the\add* sinful things
\add you desire\add*, you are slaves of your sinful desires \f + \ft personification \f*, and you will be eternally separated from God.
\add If you have yielded yourselves\add* to obey \add God\add*, you are slaves of God and you need to
\add live\add* righteously. 
\v 17 You were once slaves \add to\add* your sinful \add desires\add*. But you began to sincerely obey the new teaching \f + \ft metaphor \f*
that you were taught {that \add people\add* taught you}. I thank God for that.
\v 18  \add I\add* also \add thank God that\add* you have been freed
{\add that\add* he has freed you} from\add being controlled by a desire
to\add* sin and that you have become \add as though you were\add* slaves \f + \ft metaphor \f* to
\add living\add* righteously \f + \ft metaphor \f*. 
\v 19 I am illustrating what I say \add by talking about slavery\add* because your human nature prevents you from understanding
\add spiritual truth\add* easily. \add In the past\add* you willingly did the immoral and unlawful things that
\add your minds compelled\add* your bodies to do \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add just
like\add* slaves \add do what their masters compel them to do\add*. As a result, you did even more unlawful things. Now,
\add you need to\add* willingly allow \add your minds to compel\add* your bodies to
\add act\add* righteously \f + \ft metaphor \f*, in order that you will behave in a holy\f + \ft Or: pure way.
\v 20 When you were \add like\add* slaves \add because your sinful desires compelled you to
do\add* sinful things \f + \ft metaphor \f*, you were not \add concerned about behaving\add* righteously \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\v 21 Nevertheless, \add doing\add* those things resulted in your being separated from God, so ◄you did not benefit at all from
\add doing\add* the \add sinful\add* things that you are now ashamed of.\f + \ft Or: what \f* did you gain from
\add doing\add* the things that you are now ashamed of? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* 
\v 22 But you have been freed {\add God\add* has freed you} from
\add letting the desire to\add* sin control you. You have become
\add as though you were\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* the slaves of God. So now the result is that God has caused you to completely belong to him
and, as a result, you will live eternally. 
\v 23  \add What people receive for\add* sinning \add is that they
are\add* eternally separated from God. That is \add like\add* wages that
\add people receive\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. But what God gives us is a gift. What he gives us is that we live eternally because of
\add our relationship with\add* \f + \ft Or: because \add we are united to\add* \f* Christ Jesus our Lord.
