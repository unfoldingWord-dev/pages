\s Romans 3:1-8 
\s My reply to the objection that there is no advantage in being a Jew or being circumcised is that there is much advantage,
especially since God entrusted his promises to us. My reply to the objection that God has not kept his promise is that he
certainly has, for his promises are always true. My reply to the objection that it is not right for God to punish us Jews is
that it certainly is right for him to punish us, because if God did not judge us Jews he could not judge anyone.
\p
\v 1  \add Someone may object to this, saying\add*, “\add If being circumcised does not cause God to accept us
Jews\add*, ◄there is no advantage in being a Jew \add over being a
non-Jew\add*.\f + \ft Or: is \f* there any advantage in being a Jew \add over being a
non-Jew\add*?► \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* Being circumcised does not benefit \add us Jews at
all\add*!” 
\v 2  \add I would reply that being Jews\add* benefits\add us\add* in many ways \\f + \\ft hyperbole \\f*. First of all, it benefits us because it
was to \add our ancestors\add* that God's words, \add words that contain his
promises\add*, were given {that \add God\add* gave his words, \add words that contain his
promises\add*}. 
\v 3 Many \add Jews did not obey God as they promised that they would. So someone might
ask\add*, “Does their not being faithful mean that God will not \add bless us
Jews\add* as he promised \add that he would\add*?” 
\v 4  \add I would reply\add*, “No, it certainly does not mean that! God always does
\add what he has promised\add*, even though \add people do not\add*. All those who accuse God
\add of not keeping his promises to us Jews\add* are very mistaken.”
\add What King David wrote about God's justly saying that he would punish him for his sins is also true of those who accuse God
of not keeping his promises. What he said to God was\add*, “So everyone must acknowledge that what
you\add (sg)\add* have said \add about them\add* \f + \ft (OR, \add their
sin\add*) is true, and you will always win the case when you are accused {when
\add people\add* accuse you}.” 
\p
\v 5 So if we \add Jews'\add* being wicked \\f + \\ft personification \\f* shows that it is right that God
\add does not bless us\add*, what shall we say\f + \ft Or: conclude \f*? Shall we conclude that it is not right for God to be angry
\add and punish us Jews\add* \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f*? I \add should not be saying these
things\add*, \add but\add* I am speaking as ordinary humans \add speak\add*.
\v 6 We should certainly not \add conclude that God should not judge
us\add*, because if God \add did not judge us Jews\add*, ◄it would not possibly be right for him to judge
\add anyone in\add* the world \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f*!\f + \ft Or: how \f* could he judge \add anyone
in\add* the world?► [MTY, RHQ] 
\v 7 But \add someone might object and say to me\add*, “The fact that God truly
\add keeps his promises\add* becomes very clear\f + \ft Or: evident \f* because of my not doing
\add what God has commanded\add*. But the result is that people praise God! So ◄God should no longer say that I should be
punished {that \add he\add* should punish me} on account of my having sinned!\f + \ft Or: why \f* should God still say that I should be
punished {that \add he\add* should punish me} on account of my having sinned?► \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f*
\v 8  \add If what you, Paul, say is true\add*, then ◄we might as well\f + \ft Or: it \f* is all right for us to► do evil things in order that
good things \add like that\add* will result! For example, \add then people will praise
God!\add*” Some people speak evil about me by their \add falsely\add* saying that I say
\add such things. God\add* will fairly\f + \ft Or: justly \f* punish \add people who say such things about
me!\add* 
\s Romans 3:9-18 
\s My reply to a query about whether God will treat Jews more favorably than non-Jews is no, because the Scriptures make clear
that all people are condemned by God for their sin. 
\p
\v 9  \add If someone would ask\add*, “\add Shall we conclude that
God\add* will treat us \add Jews\add* more favorably \add and will
treat\add* the non-Jews less\add favorably\add* \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f*?” \add I would reply that we
can\add* certainly not \add conclude that!\add* I have already shown you that all people, the Jews and also the non-Jews, have
sinned and \add so they deserve to be punished\add* {\add that God will punish
them\add*} \\f + \\ft personification \\f*. 
\v 10  \add The following words\add* that are written {prophets have written}
\add in the Scriptures support this\add*, 
\p No person is righteous. There is not even one righteous person!
\v 11 There is no one who understands \add how to live properly\add* (OR,
\add about God\add*). There is no one who seeks\f + \ft Or: desires \f* \add to know\add* God!
\p
\v 12 Absolutely everyone has turned away \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* \add from God\add*. God considers them depraved (OR, Everyone has become
useless \add to God\add*). There is no one who acts righteously; no, there is not even one!
\q
\v 13 What people say \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* \add is foul\f + \ft Or: bad \f*, like the smell that comes
from\add* a grave that has been {that \add people\add* have} opened \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f*.
\add By what people say\add* \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f*, they deceive people. 
\q \add By what they say\add* \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* \add they injure people, just
like\add* the poison of snakes \add injures people\add* \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f*. 
\q
\v 14 They are continually ◄cursing\f + \ft Or: asking \f* God to do harmful things to► others and saying ◄cruel\f + \ft Or: harsh \f*\f + \ft Or: hateful \f*► things \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f*.
\q
\v 15 They ◄go quickly\f + \ft Or: are \f* eager► to murder people \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f*. 
\q
\v 16 Wherever they go they ruin everything and make \add people\add* miserable \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f*.
\q
\v 17 They have not\f + \ft Or: never \f* known how \add to live\add* peacefully
\add with other people\add*. 
\q
\v 18 They absolutely refuse to fear\f + \ft Or: reverence \f* God \\f + \\ft synecdoche \\f*! 
\s Romans 3:19-20 
\s In summary, no one is able to object to God's condemnation; everyone has been declared guilty by God.
\p
\v 19 Furthermore, we know that it is to \add Jewish\add* people,
\add who are\add* required to obey \add God's\add* laws, that Moses wrote those laws \\f + \\ft personification \\f*.
\add We can infer from this that\add* there are no \add Jews or non-Jews\add* \\f + \\ft synecdoche \\f* who are able to say anything
\add in reply to God's saying that he will punish them for having
sinned\add*. God has declared everyone in the world \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* guilty!
\v 20 It is not because people have done the things that God's laws
\add require\add* that \add God\add* will ◄erase the record of their sins\f + \ft Or: declare \f* them no longer guilty for sin►,
\add because no one has done those things completely\add*. In fact, the result of
\add our knowing God's\add* laws is that we know clearly that we have sinned (OR, are sinful).
\s Romans 3:21-26 
\s Now God erases the record of sins of everyone, Jew and non-Jew, who trusts in what Jesus Christ has done for them. God
presented Christ as the one who would atone for sins by dying on the cross.
\p
\v 21 But God's ◄erasing the record of our sins\f + \ft Or: declaring \f* us no longer guilty► does not depend on
\add our obeying\add* the laws \add that he gave Moses\add*. It has now been
{\add God\add* has now} revealed \add to us\add* how he erases the record of our sins
\add by a different way\add*. It was written about \add by Moses\add*
{\add Moses\add* wrote about it} in the laws \\f + \\ft personification \\f* \add God gave\add* him, and it was also written about by the prophets {the
prophets also wrote about it}. 
\v 22 God erases the record of our sins because we trust in \add what\add* Jesus Christ
\add has done for us\add*. God does this for every person who trusts
\add in Christ\add*, because \add he considers\add* that there is no difference
\add between Jews and non-Jews\add*. 
\v 23 All people have done evil, and all people have failed to accomplish the glorious
\add goals\add* that God \add set for them\add*. 
\v 24 Our record of sins has been erased {God erased the record of our sins} by his acting kindly
\add to forgive our sins\add*, without our doing anything to earn it. Christ Jesus accomplished this
\add by dying for us\add*. 
\v 25 God showed that Christ was the one who would atone for (OR, forgive) \f* our sins
\add with the\add* blood \add that flowed from his body when he died. God
redeems\f + \ft Or: forgives \f*\add* us because of our trusting \add in Christ's having died for us. God
wanted\add* to show that he acts justly. \add He wanted to do that\add* because, before
\add Christ came, God\add* did not punish \add everyone who sinned. So it seemed as though he was not being
just\add*. But he was overlooking their sins during \add that time\add*,
\v 26 because he is patient. \add God arranged for Christ to die for
us\add*. By doing that, he now shows that he is just, and he shows that he is justly able to erase the record of sins for
everyone who trusts\f + \ft Or: believes \f* in Jesus. 
\s Romans 3:27-31 
\s So we are prevented from boasting that it was because of our obeying the Mosaic laws. And God will also accept non-Jews on
the same basis. And by agreeing that people are declared righteous by their trusting in Christ, we actually confirm, not
nullify, the Mosaic laws. 
\p
\v 27 It is not at all \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* because of\add our obeying the\add* laws
\add of Moses that God erases the record of our sins\add*. So, ◄there is no way that we can boast
\add that God does that because of our obeying those laws\add*.\f + \ft Or: how \f* can we boast
\add about God erasing the record of our sins because of our obeying those
laws\add*?► \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* Instead, \add it is because of our\add* believing\f + \ft Or: trusting \f*\add in Christ that God erases the record of our
sins\add*. 
\v 28  \add We cannot boast about that\add*, because we conclude that the record of our sins is erased {God erases the record
of our sins} because of our trusting \add in Christ\add*. God does not erase the record of our sins because of our obeying the
laws \add that he gave to Moses, because it is impossible for us to completely obey
them\add*. 
\v 29 ◄You who are Jews certainly should not \add think that is you\add* are the only ones whom God
\add will accept\add*!\f + \ft Or: Do \f* you Jews \add think it is you\add* alone whom God
\add will accept\add*?► \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* ◄You certainly should \add realize that he will
accept\add* non-Jews, too.\f + \ft Or: Do \f* you not \add realize that he will accept\add* non-Jews, too?► \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* Of course,
\add he will accept\add* non-Jews also, 
\v 30 because, \add as you firmly believe\add*, there is only one God, who will erase the record of Jews' \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* sins if they
trust \add in what Christ has done\add*, and who will similarly erase the record of non-Jews' \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* sins if they trust
\add in Christ\add*. 
\v 31 So, \add if someone should ask concerning the laws that God gave
Moses\add*, “By saying \add that God erases the record of our sins because of
our\add* trusting \add in Christ\add*, does that mean that those laws now are useless?”,
\add I would reply\add*, “Certainly not. Instead, we truly fulfill the laws
\add that God gave Moses\add*.”
