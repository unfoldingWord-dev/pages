\c 8  
\s Romans 8:1-11 
\s God will not in any way condemn those who are united to Christ Jesus, because God's Spirit has freed us from the
inevitability of sinning and from spiritual death. 
\p
\v 1 Because \add God has erased the record of our sins because we trust in what Christ has done for
us\add*, now \add God will\add* not condemn and punish those/us who have a relationship with (OR, are united to) Christ Jesus.
\v 2  \add God's\add* Spirit causes us to live \add in a new way\add* \f + \fr personification \f* as a result of what Christ Jesus
\add did for us\add*. And he has set up a way by which he frees \add each
of\add* us from continually being forced to sin (OR, to obey our self-directed natures) and from being separated from God.
\v 3 What \add we\add* could not do \add by trying to obey\add* the laws
\add of God\add* \f + \fr personification \f*, because our self-directed nature was too weak
\add to obey them\add*, God did. He sent his own Son \add into the world in order that his Son might
atone\add* for our sin. His Son came having a body (OR, human nature) that was like
\add the body\add* (OR, the \add human nature\add*) of us people who sin.
\add By sending his Son in this way\add*, he condemned and punished
\add his Son, who never sinned, instead of punishing us, who\add* sinned \f + \fr metonymy \f*. He did that
\add by making his Son's\add* body \add a sacrifice\add* (OR, \add by causing his
Son's\add* body \add to suffer/die\add*) for \add all our\add* sin.
\v 4 So we can \add now\add* fulfill all that God required in his laws. We do this, not by our acting the way our sinful human
nature \add desires\add*, but instead by living as \add God's\add* Spirit
\add desires us to live\add*. 
\v 5 People who live according to what their self-directed nature
\add desires\add* think about and are concerned about what their self-directed nature
\add desires\add*. But people who \add live\add* according to what
\add God's\add* Spirit \add desires think about and are concerned
about\add* what \add God's\add* Spirit \add desires\add*. 
\v 6 Those people who \f + \fr personification \f* think about and are concerned about what their self-directed nature
\add desires\add* will not live eternally (OR, will be separated from God). But those people who think about and are concerned
about what \add God's\add* Spirit \add desires\add* will live \add eternally\add* and have
\add inner\add* peace. 
\v 7 Let me explain this. \add To the extent that\add* people \f + \fr personification \f* think about and are concerned about what their
self-directed nature \add desires\add*, they are acting contrary to God. They do not obey the laws of God. In fact, they are
not even able \add to obey his laws\add*. 
\v 8 The people who let their self-directed nature \add control them\add* cannot do what pleases God.
\v 9 But we do not have to let our self-directed nature \add control
us\add*. Instead, we can \add let\add* God's Spirit \add control
us\add*, because he lives within us. If people do not have \add living in
them\add* the Spirit \add who comes from\add* Christ, they do not belong to Christ.
\v 10 But since Christ \add is living in you/us by his Spirit, although\add* your/our bodies
\add are certain to\add* die because you/we sin, your/our spirits are alive because God has erased the record of your/our sins.
\v 11  \add God\add* caused Jesus to live again after he died. And because his Spirit lives in you/us,
\add God\add* will also make your/our bodies, which \add now\add* are sure to die, live
\add again after you/we die\add*. God, who caused Christ to live again after he died, will make you/us live again by
\add causing\add* his Spirit, who lives within you/us, \add to do
it\add*. 
\s Romans 8:12-13 
\s We are compelled to live as the Spirit directs, not as our self-directed nature directs, because if we do the latter we will
be eternally separated from God, but if we cease doing the latter we will live eternally.
\p
\v 12 Therefore, my fellow believers, we must \add live as the Spirit directs
us\add*. What we do not have to do is to live as our self-directed nature
\add guides us\add*. 
\v 13 If you live the way your self-directed nature \add directs\add*, you will surely not live
\add eternally\add* (OR, will surely be eternally separated from God). But if by
\add the power of God's\add* Spirit you quit doing the \add sinful\add* things that your bodies
\add desire\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f*, you will live eternally. 
\s Romans 8:14-17 
\s Because we who allow the Spirit of God to guide us are God's children, we will also inherit eternal blessings from God.
\p
\v 14 We who are guided by the Spirit of God {allow the Spirit of God to guide us} are God's children.
\v 15  \add You have showed that this is true\add*, because you received
\add from God\add* a Spirit that is not one that makes you fear \add God\add* again. You are not like slaves who
\add fear their masters\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f*. On the contrary, we have received a Spirit by whose
\add work in our hearts God\add* has adopted us. The Spirit now enables us to cry out
\add to God\add*, “\add You(sg) are my\add* Father \f + \fr doublet \f*!” 
\v 16 The Spirit himself confirms what our spirits \add say\add*, that we are God's children.
\v 17 Because we are \add God's\add* children, we also will some day receive/inherit
\add eternal blessings/privileges\add*. We will receive/inherit them from God, and we will
\add also\add* receive/inherit \add them\add* just like Christ has
\add inherited them\add*. But we must suffer \add for doing good\add* as Christ did, in order to receive splendor as he did.
\s Romans 8:18-25 
\s Since everything that God has created is eagerly awaiting the time when he will reveal who are his true children, I consider
that what we suffer now is not worth paying attention to. 
\p
\v 18 I consider that what we suffer during the present time is not worth
\add paying attention to, because\add* the future splendor/glory that will be revealed {that
\add God\add* will reveal} to us \add is so great\add*. 
\v 19 The \add things that God has\add* created are very eagerly waiting for
\add the time\add* [PRS, DOU] when God will reveal who his \add true\add* children are.
\v 20  \add God\add* caused the things that he created to be unable to achieve
\add what he had purposed. That was\add* not because they wanted to
\add be unable to do that\add*. On the contrary, \add God\add* made them that way because he wanted them to keep confidently
expecting 
\v 21 that the things that \add he\add* created will be freed {that
\add he\add* will free the things that \add he\add* created} from their sure decay \f + \fr metaphor \f*.
\add He\add* will free them in order that \add he can give them\add* the same glory that belongs to his children.
\v 22 We know that until now \add it is as though\add* all \add things\add* that God created have been groaning together,
\add and they long for that glory, just like a mother having the pains before bearing a
child\add* groans \add and longs for her baby's birth\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f*.
\v 23 Not only \add do those things groan\add*, but we ourselves also groan inwardly. We who have
\add God's\add* Spirit, who is like a partial gift \f + \fr metaphor \f* we have received as we wait for
\add the future glory, groan inwardly\add*. We groan while we wait eagerly for the time when we will receive our
\add full\add* rights as God's adopted children. That \add will include\add* his freeing our bodies
\add from the things that hinder us on earth. He will do this by giving us new
bodies\add*. 
\v 24 Ever since we were saved {since \add God\add* saved us}, we have continued to confidently expect
\add that future glory\add*. If we had what we waited for, we would not
\add need to\add* wait for it any longer, because those who have something, ◄certainly do not continue to wait for it!/will
they continue to wait for it?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* 
\v 25 But because we keep waiting expectantly to receive what we do not yet have, we wait for it eagerly and
patiently/perseveringly. 
\s Romans 8:26-27 
\s God's Spirit helps us when our spirits feel weak; he prays for us and God understands what his Spirit intends.
\p
\v 26 Similarly, in addition to our continuing to wait for what God will give us, God's Spirit helps us when our spirits feel
weak. We do not know what is proper/necessary for us to pray. But God's Spirit knows, and he prays for us when we groan (OR, he
groans) in a way that cannot be expressed in words (OR, prays with us, groaning in a way that cannot be expressed in words).
\v 27 God, who examines our inner feelings, understands what his Spirit desires/intends. What God understands is that his
Spirit prays for us who belong to God exactly as God wants him to pray.
\s Romans 8:28-30 
\s God works out all things in a way that produces good spiritual benefits for us who love him. He does this because, having
known that we would be saved and thus we would have the character of his Son, he chose us and declared us righteous, and he
will surely give us future splendor. 
\p
\v 28 And we know that to those/us who love God, he works out all things that happen
\add to them/us\add* in a way that produces good \add spiritual\add* benefits
\add for us\add*. He does this for those/us whom he has chosen, because that was (OR, was according to) what he planned to do.
\v 29 God knew previously \add that we would believe\add* in him (OR,
\add would be saved\add*). We are those who God also decided previously would have a character like his Son's character. The
result of that is that \add Christ is like\add* a firstborn/highest-ranking
\add son\add*, and \add those/we who are God's children\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f* are
\add like\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f* many \add younger\add* brothers \add of Jesus\add*.
\v 30 And us who God decided previously \add that we would be like his
Son\add* he also summoned. And for us whom he summoned, he also erased the record of our sins. And for us whose record of sins
he has erased, he also will surely give future splendor. 
\s Romans 8:31-39 
\s We must conclude from these things that no one can prevail against us, and absolutely no one and nothing can separate us
from Christ's loving us and God's loving us. 
\p
\v 31 So ◄I will tell you what we must conclude from \add all\add* these things
\add that God does for us\add*./what shall we conclude from \add all\add* these things
\add that God does for us\add*?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* Because God \add is acting\add* on our behalf, ◄no one can win against us!/can anyone
prevail against us? (OR, it does not matter if anyone opposes us)!► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*
\v 32 God did not spare even his very own Son. Instead, he turned him over
\add to others to cruelly kill him\add* in order that all we \add who believe in
him\add* may benefit \add from his dying for us. Therefore, because God did
that\add*, ◄he will also certainly give us freely everything \add that we need to live for
him\add*, in addition to \add giving us\add* Christ./will he not also certainly give us freely everything
\add that we need to live for him\add*, in addition to \add giving
us\add* Christ?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* 
\v 33 It is God himself who erases the record of our sins. So ◄no one who accuses us
\add before God will win against us\add* (OR, \add it does not matter\add* if anyone tries to accuse us) whom God has
chosen./is it possible that anyone who accuses us \add before God\add* will win against us (OR, does it matter if anyone tries
to accuse us) whom God has chosen?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* 
\v 34 It is Christ Jesus himself who pleads \add with God\add* for us, so ◄no one can condemn us (OR, say that we are still
guilty for our sin)./can anyone condemn us (OR, say that we are still guilty for our sin)?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* Christ died
\add for us\add*, but he was also raised {\add God\add* also raised him} from the dead, and he is now at the place of honor
\add ruling\add* with God \f + \fr metonymy \f*. 
\v 35 ◄Absolutely no one and nothing can cause Christ to stop loving us!/Can anyone or anything cause Christ to stop loving
us?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* That could not \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* happen\add because someone\add* afflicted us \f + \fr doublet \f*, or
\add because someone did things to\add* harm us, or \add because we
did\add* not have anything to eat, or \add because we did\add* not have enough clothes, or
\add because we lived in a\add* dangerous situation, or \add because someone killed us
with\add* a sword \f + \fr metonymy \f* (OR, murdered us). 
\v 36  \add Such things may happen to us, just like\add* it is written
{\add as David\add* wrote} \add that David said to God\add*, “Because we are
your\add (sg)\add* people, \add other people repeatedly attempt to\add* kill us. They consider that we are
\add only people to be killed\add*, \add like a butcher considers\add* that sheep are
\add only\add* animals to be slaughtered \f + \fr metaphor \f*.” 
\v 37 But even though all these bad things \add may happen to us\add*, we win completely/triumphantly
\add over these things because Christ\add*, who loves us, \add helps
us\add*. 
\v 38 I am completely convinced {absolutely certain} that neither being dead (OR, being killed), nor
\add what happens to us while\add* we live, nor angels, nor demons, nor present events, nor future events, nor powerful
\add beings/forces\add*, 
\v 39 nor \add powerful beings\add* above \add the horizon\add* or below
\add the horizon\add* \f + \fr metonymy \f*, nor anything else that \add God has\add* created can cause God to stop loving us.
\add God showed us that he loves us by sending\add* Jesus Christ our Lord
\add to die for us\add*.
