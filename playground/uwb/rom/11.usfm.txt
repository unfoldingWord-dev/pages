\c 11  
\s Romans 11:1-6 
\s God has certainly not rejected all Jews. I am evidence of that. Just like in the past, there is also at the present time a
small group of us Jews who have become believers. 
\p
\v 1 Because of that, \add if anyone should ask\add*, "Has God rejected his people
\add the Jews?" I would declare that\add* he certainly has not \add rejected all of us! You can realize that by remembering
that\add* I also belong to the \add people of\add* Israel. I am a descendant of Abraham, and I belong to the tribe of Benjamin,
\add but God has not rejected me!\add* 
\v 2 No, God has not rejected his people, whom he chose long ago
\add to be people whom he would bless in a special way\add*. Remember \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* what is written \f + \ft personification \f* in the Scriptures about
Elijah when he \add mistakenly\add* complained to God about \add the people
of\add* Israel, saying: 
\v 3 "Lord, they have killed \add the rest of\add* your\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* prophets, they have destroyed your altars. I am the only
one \add who believes in you\add* who remains \add alive\add*, and now they are trying to kill me!"
\v 4 God answered him like this: "\add You\f + \ft singular \f* are not the only one who believes in
me!\add* I have protected for myself \add not just you, but\add* 7000
\add other\add* men who have not worshipped \add the false god\add* Baal. Remember that!\f + \ft Or: Do you not remember that? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*"
\v 5 So, similarly, there is also at this time a small group \add of us
Jews\add* who have become \add believers. God\add* has chosen us
\add to become believers\add* \f + \ft Or: \add his people\add* \f* only because he acts kindly toward us, in ways that we do not deserve.
\v 6 Since it is because he acts kindly \add toward those whom he chooses, it
is\add* not because they have done good things \add that he has chosen
them\add*. If \add God chose people because they did good deeds\add*, then it would not be because he was acting toward them in
a way that they did not deserve. 
\s Romans 11:7-10 
\s The Scriptures confirm that the people of Israel as a whole did not find the way of being declared righteous, although those
whom God had chosen did find it. 
\p
\v 7  \add Since God chose only some people of Israel\add*, \add this is what I conclude:\f + \ft Or: what shall we
conclude\add*? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add Most of the people of\add* Israel did not find
\add the way for him to erase the record of their sins\add*, even though some of them were earnestly looking for it. The
\add people of Israel whom God had\add* chosen found it, but the rest
\add of them\add* were {\add God\add*} made spiritually insensitive\f + \ft Or: unresponsive \f*.
\v 8  \add Our\add* fellow Jews are just like the \add ones\add* about whom Isaiah wrote,
\q God caused their senses to be dull\f + \ft Or: made them unable to think clearly \f*. Up to this very
day\add , they have\add* eyes but they cannot see \add spiritually\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\add They have\add* ears, but they cannot understand \add spiritually\add*.
\q
\v 9 And \add they remind me of what King\add* David said, \add when he asked God to cause his enemies' senses to be
dull\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, 
\q \add Make them stupid\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*, \add like animals that are\add* caught in snares!
\q May they \add feel secure because of the things that they enjoy but which will catch them like
a\add* trap \f + \ft doublet, metaphor \f*, with the result that you will destroy them.
\q
\v 10 May their ability to perceive \add danger\add* be dulled {Dull their ability to perceive
\add spiritually\add*} \f + \ft metaphor \f*, with the result that they will not
\add become alarmed\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add when there is danger\add*. 
\q May you cause them to carry heavy loads on their backs continually
\add as slaves do\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*. 
\s Romans 11:11-12 
\s My reply to a query as to whether the result of the Jews' unbelief is a permanent falling away from God is, "No! God is
saving many non-Jews to make the Jews envious and thus seek to be saved."
\p
\v 11  \add Perhaps someone will ask\add*, "\add When the Jews\add* sinned
\add by not believing in Christ, did\add* it result in their separating themselves from God
\add permanently?\add*" Then I \add would reply\add*, \add No\add*, they have certainly not
\add separated themselves from God permanently!\add* What is happening is that because they sinned,
\add God\add* is saving non-Jews in order to cause \add the Jews\add* to envy
\add the way he blesses non-Jews and so ask Christ to save them\add*.
\v 12  \add When the Jews\add* sinned \f + \ft Or: rejected Christ \f*, \add the result was that
God\add* abundantly \add blessed the other people in\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* the world by
\add offering them the opportunity to believe\add*. And \add when the
Jews\add* failed \add spiritually, the result was that God\add* abundantly
\add blessed\add* the non-Jews. Since that is true, think how wonderful it will be when the complete number
\add of the Jews whom God has chosen will believe in Christ\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*!
\s Romans 11:13-16 
\s I highly esteem the work that God has called me to do as an apostle among you non-Jews. I hope that I will make my fellow
Jews jealous, and as a result, some of them will be saved. 
\p
\v 13 Now it is to you non-Jews that I am saying \add what follows\add*. I am the one who is the apostle to non-Jews, and I
highly esteem this work \add that God appointed\add* me to do. 
\v 14 But I also hope that \add by my labors\add* I will make my fellow Jews jealous\f + \ft Or: want what you non-Jews have \f*,
\add with the result that\add* some of them will \add believe and
thus\add* be saved. 
\v 15  \add God\add* has rejected \add most of my fellow Jews because they refused to believe, with the result
that\add* he reconciled \add many other people in\add* the world \f + \ft metonymy \f*
\add to himself\add*. But he will accept \add my fellow Jews again when they trust in
Christ!\add* And this is what the result will be.\f + \ft Or: do you know what the result will be? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* It will be
\add as though God is making them\add* alive again after they have been dead!
\v 16  \add Just like\add* the whole lump \add of dough\add* will belong to God if
\add people offer\add* to God \f + \ft metaphor \f* the \add bread baked from\add* the first part
\add of it\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add so the Jews will belong to God because their ancestors belonged to
God\add*. And just like the branches \add of a tree\add* will be good if the root is good \f + \ft metaphor \f*,
\add so the descendants of our great Jewish ancestors who belonged to God will also some day belong to
God\add*. 
\s Romans 11:17-24 
\s You non-Jews who trust in Jesus must not despise the Jews whom God has rejected. You must not become proud, but instead
beware. God will not spare you if you fall away from him, and he will certainly act kindly toward the Jews if they trust in
Christ. 
\p
\v 17  \add God has rejected\add* many of \add the Jews\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*,
\add like\add* branches \add of a tree\add* are broken off {\add like
people\add* break off\add dead\add* branches \add of a tree\add*}. And each of you
\add non-Jews whom God has accepted is like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add a branch
of\add* a wild\f + \ft Or: uncultivated \f* olive tree \add that\add* was {\add that
someone\add*} grafted among the branches \f + \ft Or: onto one of the branches \f*
\add that were left on a cultivated olive tree\add*. \add God has
caused\add* you \add to benefit from how he blessed our\f + \ft exclusive \f* first Jewish ancestors, as
branches\add* benefit from the nutritious sap from the root of a
\add cultivated\add* olive tree \f + \ft metaphor \f*. 
\v 18 However, you \add non-Jews\add* must not despise \add the Jews whom God
rejected\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add who are like\add* the branches that \add were broken off from the
tree\add*! If any of you \add wants to\add* boast \add about having received blessings from
God\add*, \add remember this: Branches\add* do not nourish a root. Instead the root nourishes
\add the branches\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. \add Similarly, you are blessed by God because of
what\add* you \add have received from the Jews! It is not what the Jews have received
from\add* you \add that blesses them\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*! 
\v 19 If one of you then says, "\add God rejected the Jews\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*
\add like\add* branches \f + \ft metaphor \f* that are broken {that people broke} off
\add a tree and rejected\add*, in order that \add he might accept us non-Jews,
as\add* branches \f + \ft metaphor \f* of a tree are grafted in {\add as people\add* graft in branches of a tree},"
\v 20  \add I would reply that\add* this is true. However, it is because the Jews did not believe
\add in Christ\add* that they were rejected \f + \ft metaphor \f* {that \add God\add* rejected \f + \ft metaphor \f* them}. As for you, it is
\add only\add* because you believe \add in Christ\add* that \add God has
accepted\add* you! \add So\add* do not \add any of you\add* become proud, but instead beware
\add of what could happen to you\add*! 
\v 21 Since God did not spare \add the unbelieving Jews\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*
\add who were like a tree's\add* natural branches, he will not spare any of you
\add if you do\add* not\add keep trusting in him!\add* 
\p
\v 22 Note then, that God acts kindly, but he also acts severely. He has acted severely toward
\add the Jews\add* who have stopped trusting in\f + \ft Or: obeying \f* him. On the other hand, he acts kindly toward each of you
\add non-Jews only\add* if you continue \add to appreciate his acting\add* kindly
\add toward you\add*. However, you will be rejected {\add he\add* will reject you} if you do not
\add keep trusting in him\add*. 
\v 23 And if the Jews believe \add in Christ\add* \f + \ft litotes \f*, God also will
\add reunite them to himself as\add* branches are grafted {\add as
people\add* graft branches} into \add a tree again\add*, because God is able to do that.
\v 24 Each of you \add non-Jews who were previously separated from God has benefited from the ways in which God blessed the
Jews\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. \add That is like taking branches\add* that have been cut {that someone has cut} from a wild olive tree that
just grew \add without being planted\add* {\add someone planting
it\add*} and, contrary to what people usually do, grafting them into a cultivated olive tree. So God will much more readily
\add receive back the Jews because they belonged to him before\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*!
\add That will be like\add* the original branches \add that had been cut
off\add* being grafted {like grafting the original branches \add that someone cut
off\add*,} back into the olive tree to which they \add originally
belonged\add*! 
\s Romans 11:25-33 
\s I want you to know that all the people of Israel will some day be saved, as the Scriptures say will happen. God still loves
them because of their ancestors. It is his purpose to act mercifully towards them as well as toward all non-Jews.
\p
\v 25 My \add non-Jewish\add* fellow believers, I certainly want you to understand \f + \ft litotes \f* this truth that God has now revealed
\add about my fellow Jews who are refusing to believe\add*. You should not proudly think
\add that\add* God \add now favors you\add* more \add than the Jews\add* \f + \ft Or:
\add that you understand God's further plans for the Jews\add* \f*. Many
\add people of\add* Israel will continue to be stubborn until all the non-Jews
\add whom God has chosen have believed in Jesus\add*. 
\v 26 And then all \f + \ft hyperbole \f* \add the people of\add* Israel will be saved
{\add God\add* will save all \f + \ft hyperbole \f* \add the people of\add* Israel}. Then these words that are written {that
\add a prophet\add* wrote} \add in the Scriptures will\add* \add become true\f + \ft Or: be
fulfilled\add* \f*: 
\p The one who sets \add his people\add* free will originate from
\add the place where\add* God dwells \f + \ft Or: from the Jews \f* \f + \ft metonymy \f*. Then he will remove the guilt of the Israelite people \f + \ft Or:
descendants of Jacob \f* \f + \ft metonymy \f*. 
\p
\v 27 And \add as God says\add*, 
\p The contract that I will make with them is that I will forgive their sins.
\p
\v 28 With regard to \add the Jews rejecting\add* the good message
\add about Christ, God treats\add* them as enemies, which has benefited you
\add non-Jews\add*. But in regard to \add their being the people whom
God\add* chose, \add God still\add* loves them because of \add what he
promised\add* their ancestors. 
\v 29  \add He still loves them\add*, because he never changed his mind about the privileges\f + \ft Or: blessings \f* he
\add gave to them\add* and about his choosing \add them to be his
people\add*. 
\v 30 You \add non-Jews\add* once disobeyed God, but now he has acted mercifully towards you because the
\add Jews\add* disobeyed him. 
\v 31 Similarly, now they have disobeyed God. The result is that by the very same way in which he acted mercifully towards you,
he will act mercifully towards them \add again\add*. 
\v 32 God has declared and proved that all people, \add both Jews and
non-Jews\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, disobey \add him\f + \ft Or: his laws\add* \f*. He has declared that because he wants to act mercifully towards us all.
\s Romans 11:33-36 
\s I marvel at how great God's wisdom and knowledge are, and his decisions and actions toward us!
\p
\v 33  \add I marvel how\add* vast and great are the wise things that God
\add has done\add* and what he has \add always\add* known \f + \ft doublet \f*! We are completely unable to understand the things that he has
decided and the ways \add in which he acts toward us\add* \f + \ft doublet \f*!
\v 34  \add I remember the Scriptures that say\add*, 
\q No one has known what the Lord thinks.\f + \ft Or: Who has known what the Lord thinks? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* Absolutely no one has given him advice
\add about what he should do!\add*\f + \ft Or: Who has advised him \add about what he should
do\add*? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* 
\q
\v 35 And, 
\q No one has given anything to God that\add he did not previously receive from
God!\add*\f + \ft Or: Has anyone given anything to God that\add he did not previously receive from
God\add*? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* So God is not obligated to\f + \ft Or: does not have to \f* pay back anything to anyone!
\p
\v 36 God \add is the one who created\add* all things. He is also the one who
\add sustains all things\add*. The reason that he created them was that
\add everything he created might praise\add* him. May\add all people\add* honor him forever! May it be so!\f + \ft Or: Amen! \f*
