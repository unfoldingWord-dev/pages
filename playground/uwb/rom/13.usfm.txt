\c 13  
\s Romans 13:1-7 
\s Be subject to civil authorities, because those who oppose them oppose what God has established and will bring punishment on
themselves. Do what is good and then they will commend you. Give to all the authorities what you are obligated to give to them.
\p
\v 1 Every \add believer\add* must be subject to civil officials.
\add Remember that\add* God is the only one \add who gives officials
their\add* authority. Furthermore, those officials that exist are ones who have been appointed by God {God has appointed}.
\v 2 So whoever resists the officials is resisting what God has established. Furthermore, those who resist officials will bring
on themselves \add from the officials\add* the punishment \add that God considers
fitting\add*. 
\v 3 What rulers \add do\add* is not \add to cause people who\add* do good deeds to be afraid. Instead,
\add what they do is to cause people who do\add* evil to be afraid. So, if any of you \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* wants to be unafraid of officials,
do what is good! \add If you(sg) do good\add*, they will commend you
\add instead of punishing you!\add* 
\v 4 It is in order to serve God \add by doing their work that every official
exists\add*, in order that they may benefit each of you. If any of you does what is evil,
you\add (sg) will rightfully have reason to\add* be afraid, because the authority that they have to punish people \f + \fr metonymy \f* is very
real \f + \fr litotes \f*! The officials exist to serve God. That is, they act as God's agents as they punish those who do evil.
\v 5 So, it is necessary for you\add (pl)\add* to be subject \add to
officials\add*, not only because they will punish you \f + \fr metonymy \f* \add if you disobey
them\add*, but also because you know within yourselves\add that you should be subject to
them\add*! 
\v 6 It is for this reason that you also pay taxes, because the officials are ones who serve God as they continually do their
work. 
\v 7 Give to all \add the officials\add* what you are supposed to give to them! Pay taxes to
\add those who require that you pay taxes\add*. Pay duties \add on goods to those who require that you pay
those\add* duties. Respect \add those who ought to\add* be respected. Honor
\add those who ought to\add* be honored. 
\s Romans 13:8-10 
\s Do not leave any debt unpaid. Your only continual obligation is to love one another, because doing so fulfills all that
God's law requires. 
\p
\v 8 Pay all of your debts \add when you are supposed to pay them\add*. The only thing
\add that is like\add* a debt that \add you\add* should never stop paying is to love one another. Whoever loves others has
fulfilled all that \add God requires in\add* his laws. 
\v 9  \add There are many things that God\add* commanded \add in his laws, such
as\add* do not commit adultery, do not murder \add anyone\add*, do not steal, and do not desire anything that belongs to
someone else. But the command by which they are all summed up {that includes them all} is this: Each of you must love the
people with whom you come in contact, just like you\add (sg)\add* love yourself.
\v 10 If you love people with whom you come in contact \f + \fr personification \f*, you will not do any evil to them \f + \fr litotes \f*. So, whoever loves
\add others\add* fulfills all that \add God's\add* laws \add require\add*.
\s Romans 13:11-14 
\s Because it is time for us to be fully alert and active, we must quit doing wicked deeds. We must do those things that will
help us resist that which is evil, we must live properly, and we must be like Christ.
\p
\v 11  \add Do\add* what I have just told you, especially since you know
\add the significance of\add* the time \add in which we are living. You know that it
is\add* time for you to be \add fully alert and active\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f*,
\add like people who have\add* awakened from sleeping \f + \fr metaphor \f*, because
\add the time when Christ will finally\add* deliver us \add from this world's pain/sin and
sorrow\add* is near. That time ◄is closer than/was not so close► when we first believed
\add in Christ\add*. 
\v 12  \add Our time to live in this world\add* \f + \fr metonymy \f* \add is almost
ended\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f*, \add like\add* a night that is nearly ended. The time
\add when Christ will return\add* \f + \fr metonymy \f* is near. So we must quit doing wicked deeds \f + \fr metaphor \f*
\add such as people do\add* in the darkness, and \add we must be doing the things that will help us resist
Satan/evil\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f*, \add as soldiers who\add* put on their armor in the daytime
\add get ready to resist their enemies\add*. 
\v 13 We must behave properly, as though the time \add when Christ will
return\add* \f + \fr metonymy \f* \add were already here\add*. We must not participate in drunken carousing \f + \fr hendiadys \f*. We must not commit any kind
of sexual immorality [MTY, DOU]. We must not quarrel. We must not be jealous
\add of other people\add*. 
\v 14 On the contrary, you/we should \add be like\add* the Lord Jesus Christ
\add so that others will see what he is like\add*, just as\add people\add* put on
\add special clothes so that others will see what group they belong
to\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f*. You/We should stop thinking about \add doing the things that
your/our\add* self-directed nature desires.
