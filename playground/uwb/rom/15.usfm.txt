\c 15  
\s Romans 15:1-4 
\s We should not be irritated by the practices of those who are uncertain whether God will condemn them for doing certain
things that the Mosaic laws forbid. Instead, we should do things that please our fellow Christians, because Christ has set us
an example. 
\p
\v 1 Most of us are sure \add that God will not punish us for doing certain things that the laws and rituals God gave Moses
said the Jews should not do. But we\add* should be patient with those who are uncertain
\add about such things\add*, and we should not let them irritate us. We should not
\add simply\add* please ourselves. 
\v 2 Each of us should \add do the things that\add* please the fellow
\add believers with whom we come in contact, and things that will\add* benefit them.
\add We should do those things\add* in order to help them mature
\add spiritually\add*. 
\v 3  \add We should please our fellow believers\add*, since Christ
\add has set us an example\add*. He did not \add do things to\add* please himself. On the contrary,
\add he tried to please God even when others insulted him. That was\add* as it is written {as
◄\add someone\f + \ft Or: the \f* Psalmist\add*► wrote} \add in Scripture that the Messiah said to
God\add*: “When people insulted you\add (sg)\add*, \add it was as
though\add* they were also insulting me.” 
\v 4 And \add you need to remember that\add* what was written previously {what
\add God's servants\add* previously wrote} \add in the Scriptures\add*, was written
{\add they\add* wrote} to teach us in order that we would be patient and be encouraged
\add by reading\f + \ft Or: believing \f* what\add* they wrote. If we do that, we can confidently expect
\add God to do for us all he has promised\add*. 
\s Romans 15:5-6 
\s May God enable you all to live harmoniously with each other. 
\p
\v 5 God is the one who enables us to be patient and who encourages us.
◄\add Ask\f + \ft Or: Pray \f* to\add*► \add him that he would\add* enable you \add all\add* to live harmoniously with each other, doing as
Christ Jesus \add did\add*. 
\v 6 Then, as you are united in what you think and say \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f*, you will praise God,
\add who is the heavenly\add* father \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* of our Lord Jesus Christ.
\s Romans 15:7-12 
\s Accept each other as Christ has accepted you, remembering that what Christ has done was both to help the Jews and to cause
non-Jews to praise God. 
\p
\v 7 So \add I say to all of you believers at Rome\add*, accept each other.
\add If you do that\add*, people will praise God \add as they see you thus behaving like Christ. Accept each
other\add* just like Christ accepted you! 
\v 8 I want \add you to remember\add* that Christ \add helped us\add* Jews \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* by what he did, in order to show that God ◄is
faithful\f + \ft Or: does \f* what he says he will do►. That is, \add his coming as our
Messiah\add* fulfilled what God promised to \add our Jewish\add* ancestors.
\v 9 And \add by acting mercifully to them, he also caused\add* the non-Jews to praise him.
\add What he has done for the non-Jews\add* fulfills what is written
\add in the Scriptures that David said to God\add*: “So I will praise
you\add (sg) when I am\add* among the non-Jews, and I will sing to you \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f*.”
\v 10  \add David\add* also wrote, “Rejoice, you non-Jews, with us who are God's people.”
\v 11  \add And Moses wrote in\add* the \add Scriptures\add*, “Praise the Lord, all
\add you\add* non-Jews, and may everyone praise him \\f + \\ft doublet \\f*.” 
\v 12 And Isaiah wrote \add in the Scriptures\add*, “There will be a descendant \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* of
\add King\add* David who will begin to rule the non-Jews. They will confidently expect him
\add to fulfill what he has promised\add*.” 
\s Romans 15:13 
\s May God make you completely joyful and peaceful in order that you may have abundant hope.
\p
\v 13 God is the one who causes you to be confidently expecting \add him to do what he has promised. I
pray\f + \ft Or: ask \f*\add* that he will cause you to be completely joyful and peaceful as you trust
\add in him\add*. As you do that, the Holy Spirit will enable you to more and more confidently expect
\add to receive what God has promised you\add*. 
\s Romans 15:14-16 
\s I have written frankly to you in this letter because of what God has kindly commissioned me to do among the non-Jews.
\p
\v 14 My fellow believers, I myself am \add completely\add* sure about you that you yourselves
\add have acted toward others\add* in a completely good way. You have done that because you have known completely
\add all that God wants you to know\add* \\f + \\ft hyperbole \\f* and because you are able to teach each other.
\v 15 However, I have written to you quite frankly \add in this letter\add* about some things in order to remind you
\add about those things\add*. \add I have written this\add* because I have been appointed by God {God has
\add appointed\add* me}, which I did not deserve, 
\v 16 in order that I would work for Jesus Christ among the non-Jews.
\add God has appointed me\add* to act like a priest as I \add proclaim\add* his good message in order that he will accept the
non-Jews \add who believe in Christ. They will be\add* like an offering \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f*
\add to God\add* as a result of their being dedicated \add to him\add* by the Holy Spirit {the Holy Spirit dedicating them
\add to God\add*}. 
\s Romans 15:17-21 
\s I am happy about my work for God that I have now completed in this region by proclaiming the gospel in places where people
have not heard about Christ. 
\p
\v 17 It follows that, because \add of my relationship with\add* \f + \ft (OR, because
\add I belong to\add*) Christ Jesus, I am happy about \add my work
for\add* God. 
\v 18 I will speak boldly only \\f + \\ft litotes \\f* about the work that Christ has enabled me to do.
\add I do that work\add* in order that non-Jews might pay attention to
\add the message about Christ\add* as a result of what I have said and done,
\v 19 specifically, by \add my performing\add* many powerful miracles \\f + \\ft doublet \\f*.
\add I have done those things\add* as a result of \add God's\add* Spirit powerfully
\add enabling me\add*. As a result \add of doing those things, while
traveling\add* all the way around from Jerusalem to Illyricum \add province\add*, I have completed
\add my work\add* of proclaiming the message about Christ \add in those
places\add*. 
\v 20 As \add I proclaim\add* that message, I am always eagerly trying to proclaim it
\add in places\add* where people have not already heard about Christ. I do that in order that
\add as I work for God\add* I might not \add be continuing the work for him that someone else already
started\add* \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f*. \add I do not want to be like a man who\add* builds
\add a house\add* on someone else's foundation. 
\v 21 On the contrary, \add I teach non-Jews, so that what happens may be
like\add* what was written {the prophet Isaiah wrote} \add in the Scriptures about the
Messiah\add*: “Those who did not hear about him previously will perceive
\add his truth\add*. Truly, those who have not heard \add about him will hear
and\add* understand \add his message\add* \\f + \\ft doublet \\f*.” 
\s Romans 15:22-29 
\s Because of this work, I have often been hindered from visiting you, but I hope to see you as I journey through your area and
I hope that you will give me what I need for my next journey. But now I am about to go to Jerusalem to take funds to God's
people there. So later I will visit you in Rome, and I know that Christ will bless us there.
\p
\v 22 Because \add I have attempted to preach the message about Christ in places where they have not heard about
him\add*, I have been hindered {things have hindered me} many times
\add from being able\add* to visit you. 
\v 23 But now there are no more places in these regions \add where people have not heard about
Christ\add*. Furthermore, for several years I have wanted to visit you.
\v 24  \add So I hope to go\f + \ft Or: come \f* to see you\add*. I hope to do that as soon as I am on my way to
\add the provinces in\add* Spain. I hope to see you as I journey through
\add your area\add*, and I hope that \add by whatever you give me\add* \\f + \\ft euphemism \\f* you will help me on my journey to Spain. But
before \add I go there\add*, I want to enjoy being with you for a little while, although
\add I would like to stay with you longer\add*. 
\v 25 But \add I cannot visit you\add* now, because I am about to go to Jerusalem in order to take money \\f + \\ft euphemism \\f* for God's people
\add there\add*. 
\v 26  \add The believers in\add* Macedonia and Achaia \add provinces\add* \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* decided to contribute some
\add money\add* \\f + \\ft euphemism \\f* for those of God's people in Jerusalem who are poor.
\v 27 They themselves decided \add to do this, but\add* truly they owe something to God's people in Jerusalem. The non-Jewish
\add believers\add* benefited spiritually from Jewish \add believers as a result of hearing the message about Christ from
them\add*, so the non-Jews should also help the Jewish believers
\add in Jerusalem by giving them\add* material things (OR, money) \\f + \\ft euphemism \\f*.
\v 28 So when I have finished this \add task\add* by safely delivering all this money [MET, EUP]
\add that the believers in Macedonia and Achaia have given\add*, I will leave
\add Jerusalem and visit\add* you \add in Rome while I am\add* on my way to Spain.
\v 29 And I know that when I visit you, Christ will abundantly bless
\add us\add* (OR, enable \add me\add* to bless \add you\add*) \f*. 
\s Romans 15:30-33 
\s I urge you to pray fervently that God will protect me from the unbelieving Jews in Judea and that God's people there will
accept the money that I take to them, and also that I may be refreshed by visiting you. May God be with you all.
\p
\v 30 Because \add we belong to\add* our Lord Jesus Christ and because the Spirit
\add of God causes us to\add* love \add each other\add*, I urge you
\add all\add* that \add you help me\add* by fervently\f + \ft Or: intensely \f* praying to God for me.
\v 31  \add Pray that\add* I will be protected {\add that God\add* will protect me} so that the
\add Jews\add* in Judea who do not believe \add the message about Christ will not harm
me\add*. Also pray that God's people in Jerusalem will accept the money \\f + \\ft euphemism \\f* that I
\add take\add* to them. 
\v 32 Pray these things in order that I may go\f + \ft Or: come \f* to you if God wants me to go\f + \ft Or: come \f*, and that I may come joyfully, and that
then God will refresh my \add spirit as a result of my visiting\f + \ft Or: being \f*\add* with you.
\v 33  \add I pray that\add* God, who \add causes us to have inner\add* peace, will be with all of you
\add and will help\add* you. ◄May it be so!\f + \ft Or: Amen \f*!►
