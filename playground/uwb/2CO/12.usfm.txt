\c 12  
\p
\v 1  \add It seems that\add* it is necessary for me to go on boasting
\add about myself\add*. Although \add I do\add* not \add think that my telling you
about\add* this will help \add you to accept me as Christ's representative to
you\add*, I \add will say this anyway\add*. I will tell you about visions that the Lord
\add gave a certain man\add* and about things that he \add supernaturally\add* revealed
\add to that man. I will tell you this because some of the people among you boast that it was in visions that they received the
things that they teach\add*. 
\v 2 The man that I will tell you about is one \add who believes\add* in Christ. Fourteen years ago he was taken
{\add Christ\add* took him} up into the highest heaven, \add the place where God
is\add*. I do not know whether he went there \add in his physical
body\add* or whether he was outside of his body \add at that time and only his spirit
went\add*. Only God really knows. 
\v 3-4 But he was \add suddenly\add* taken {\add Christ suddenly\add* took him} up to
\add a place called\add* Paradise, \add that wonderful place where God lives. I repeat
that\add* I do not know whether his body \add went there\add* or only his spirit. Only God knows
\add that. While he was there, God\add* told him some things that he does not allow
\add human beings\add* to tell \add others about\add*. 
\v 5 I will proudly talk about that man. However, I will not be boasting
\add as\add* I say that I \add am the one who saw and heard those wonderful
things\add*. I will talk only about the things that \add cause others to think
of\add* me as a weak \add human being like everyone else\add*. 
\v 6 But even if I should choose to boast \add to you about such wonderful things that happened to
me\add*, I would not be \add speaking like\add* a fool, because I would be telling you the truth. But I will not
\add talk proudly about such things\add*, because I do not want any of you to think highly of me
\add because of the things that have happened to me\add*. Instead,
\add I want you to decide what kind of person I am by the way you
see\add* me \add acting\add* and by what you hear me teach. 
\v 7 In order that I might not become proud because of those many wonderful things
\add that Christ\add* revealed to me, \add God permitted\add* Satan to send a messenger
\add to humble me\add* (OR, to \add make me sick\add*). \add What he did to me was painful,
like\add* [MET] a thorn pricking my body. 
\v 8 Three times I prayed to the Lord about it, begging him to take this away from me.
\v 9 But he said to me, “\add No, I will not take this away from you.
Instead\add*, I will kindly help you, and that will be all that you need, because it is
\add when you are\add* weak that I \add can\add* best \add work\add* powerfully
\add to help you\add*.” So, because of \add what the Lord said to
me\add*, I will very gladly boast about \add the things that make\add* me
\add seem\add* weak, so that \add people may realize\add* that it is Christ who gives me power
\add to serve him\add*. 
\v 10 For that reason, \add whenever I am\add* weak, or \add when
people\add* insult me, \add or when I have to endure\add* hardships, or
\add when I am persecuted\add* {\add people\add* cause me to suffer} or
\add when I am in situations that\add* distress me, I am content because
\add I am serving\add* Christ. \add I can say that\add* because at any time when I myself am weak, that is the
\add very\add* time when \add Christ\add* powerfully \add helps me\add*.
\s 2 Corinthians 12:11-18 
\s When I was with you, I did things that showed you that I am truly Christ's representative. But I still will not take pay
from you when I come to visit you again. And those people are wrong who say that I tricked you by sending Titus to get money
for myself from you. 
\p
\v 11 It has been foolish for me \add to talk about myself like this\add*, but it is you who forced me to do it. Truly
\add if the Lord would not help me\add*, I would be worthless, \add as my opponents say that I
am\add*. But none of the men whom you \add wrongfully think\add* [IRO] are great apostles are greater in any way than I am. So
it would have been right/proper for you to say good things about me.
\v 12  \add You should have done that, because\add* when I was with you
\add I\add* repeatedly did the things that showed you that \add I am
truly\add* an apostle, such as performing many [DOU] miracles. 
\v 13 And I have \add certainly treated\add* you as well as \add I
treated\add* the other congregations \add that I helped to start. Or do you think
that\add* by not asking you \add to pay me for my work\add*, I was not treating you as well as I treated the other
congregations? ◄It is foolish for you to\add think that\add* [IRO]
\add it\add* was wrong for me not \add to ask for pay from you for my work, and therefore I should
ask\add* you to forgive me for that!/Do you \add think that it\add* was wrong for me not
\add to ask for pay from you for my work, and therefore I should
ask\add* you to forgive me for that?► [RHQ] 
\p
\v 14 Now listen to me! It is time for me to come to you for a third
\add visit. When I come\add*, I \add still\add* will not insist that you
\add pay me for my work\add*, because I do not want \add any of\add* your
\add money\add* [EUP]! What I want is for you [MTY] \add to love and appreciate
me\add*. It is not \add normally the duty of\add* children to save
\add money to provide for the needs of\add* their parents. Instead, it
\add is the duty of\add* parents to \add provide\add* for their children [MET]. In the same way,
\add it is not your duty to provide for me. Instead, it is my duty to provide spiritual help for you because you are my
spiritual children\add*. 
\v 15 So, on my part, \add as a good parent would do\add*, I will be very happy to use everything that I have, and do
everything that I possibly can, \add in order to help you\add*. And because I love you very much, ◄I will be very disappointed
if \add you\add* do not love me a little bit, too./will \add you\add* not love me a little bit, too?► [RHQ]
\p
\v 16  \add You all\add* know that I did not depend on you \add to provide for my
needs\add*. However, \add there are some who accuse me, saying that\add* [IRO] I was very clever and got money from you by
tricking you. 
\v 17 But did I ever do that? No! I never [RHQ] asked any of the men whom I sent to you
\add to get money\add* from you \add and bring it to me\add*! 
\v 18 Titus went \add and visited you because\add* I urged him to do so. I also sent the other believer,
\add whom you know\add*, to go with Titus. \add You know that\add* Titus did not [RHQ] trick
\add you in order to get money from you. And you certainly know that\add* he and I have always [RHQ] acted in exactly the same
\add honest\add* way \add towards you\add*. 
\s 2 Corinthians 12:19-13:10 
\s I am worried that when I visit you I will find that many of you are still sinning. I pray that God will help you turn from
your sinful behavior, so that I will not have to discipline you when I come.
\p
\v 19 While \add you have been reading this letter, if\add* you have been thinking that I have
\add just\add* been \add saying these things to\add* defend myself
\add against those who accuse me, you are wrong\add*. I have been saying
\add these things honestly, knowing\add* that God is listening \add to me. I also speak as one who has a close
relationship\add* with Christ. Everything that I do and \add everything that I say
is\add* to \add help you\add* whom I love ◄to grow \add spiritually/\add*to
become\add spiritually\add* mature►. 
\v 20  \add I have written this way to you\add* because I worry that when I come
\add to visit you\add*, I will see that \add some of\add* you are
\add not conducting your lives the way\add* that I want you \add to\add*. If that is so,
\add when I get there\add* you will see that I will have \add to
act\add* in a \add very severe way toward you, and I am sure\add* that you do not want that. Specifically, I am afraid that
\add some of you\add* may be quarreling, or that you are being jealous
\add of each other\add*, or that you quickly \add show others that you
are\add* very angry \add with them\add*, or that you are acting selfishly, or that
\add some of\add* you are saying bad things about others, or that you are ◄spreading false rumors/saying false things► about
each other, or that you are acting proudly, or that you are \add doing
things\add* in a disorderly manner. 
\v 21  \add I\add* ◄\add feel anxious/am concerned\add*► \add about you. I worry
that\add* when I visit you again, God, the one whom I \add serve\add*, will make me feel ashamed of you
\add when I see that\add* you \add still are not conducting your lives as believers
should\add*. Then I will feel very sad about \add some of\add* you who were sinning previously and have not turned from your
sinful behavior. \add Some of you\add* may still have impure \add thoughts. Some of
you\add* may be having sexual intercourse with those to whom you are not married.
\add And some of you\add* may be doing other shameful things.
