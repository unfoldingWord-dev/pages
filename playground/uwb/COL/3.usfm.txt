\s Colossians 3:1-4 
\s Be constantly wanting what is associated with heaven. 
\p
\v 1 You now are alive \add spiritually\add*, and \add it is as though you were
raised\add* {\add God caused you to become alive\add*} when he caused Christ to become alive again. So be constantly wanting
what is associated with heaven [MTY], where Christ is. There God has given him supreme authority and the highest honor.
\v 2 Be constantly wanting the blessings that God has prepared for you in heaven [MTY]. Do not be constantly wanting
\add to do the evil deeds that people on\add* earth do [MTY], 
\v 3 because you have \add ceased to behave as you formerly did. You are like people who
have\add* died. You now live \add spiritually\add* together with Christ in
\add the presence of\add* God; and \add people\add* cannot see that.
\v 4 When Christ, who causes you to live \add spiritually\add*, is publicly revealed, then God will also reveal you publicly
together with Christ, \add and you together with Christ will be\add* glorious.
\s Colossians 3:5-11 
\s Do not do what is evil. 
\p
\v 5  \add Get rid of your evil practices/deeds\add* [MET, MTY] \add as though they were enemies
whom\add* you were killing (OR, \add Get rid of doing evil\add* [MET, MTY], just as dead people do not do what is evil).
Specifically, do not practice sexual immorality. Do not commit unnatural sexual acts. Do not desire to act like that, and do
not desire \add to do anything that is\add* evil. Do not desire to have more things than you need, because, if you do that, you
are ◄worshipping material things instead of worshipping God/making material things to become your god►.
\v 6  \add Do not behave like that\add* since God will punish [MTY] those who disobey him, because they act like that.
\v 7 You also formerly behaved like that when you were disobeying God.
\v 8 Now, however, as for you, do not do any of these evil deeds: Do not get angry in any way [DOU]. Do not act maliciously. Do
not ◄slander/talk evil about► people. Do not talk abusively to people.
\v 9 Do not lie to one another. Do not do those things, because you have ◄disposed of/stopped obeying► your former evil nature
and stopped doing what you did when you had that former \add evil\add* nature,
\v 10 and because you have received a new nature. God is causing your new nature to become more and more like his own nature.
He created your new nature in order that \add you might get to\add* know
\add God\add* truly. 
\v 11 As a result of that, it is not \add important whether anyone is
a\add* non-Jew or a Jew, or \add whether anyone is\add* circumcised or not, or
\add whether anyone is\add* a foreigner, or even uncivilized, or
\add whether anyone is\add* a slave or not a slave. But \add what is important
is\add* Christ, who is supremely important in every way. 
\s Colossians 3:12-14 
\s Do what is good; in particular, love one another. 
\p
\v 12 Because God has chosen you and reserved you to be his people, and because
\add God\add* loves you, be compassionate to one another. Be kind to one another. Be humble. Be meek (OR, be considerate toward
one another), be patient with one another, 
\v 13 and tolerate one another. Forgive one another, if one of you has a grudge/complaint against another. Just like the Lord
\add Jesus freely/willingly\add* forgave you, you too \add must freely/willingly forgive one
another\add*. 
\v 14 And what is more important than all of these is that you love one another, because by doing that you will be perfectly
united together. 
\s Colossians 3:15-16 
\s Continue to be at peace with one another, be constantly thanking God, and continue getting to know thoroughly the message
about Christ. 
\p
\v 15 Because God chose you to live peacefully \add with one another\add* in your local congregations, let that peace which
Christ gives control your ◄inner beings/hearts►, and be constantly thanking God.
\v 16 And continue to let the message about Christ govern/direct all you think and do, as you very wisely teach and warn one
another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs (OR, songs that God's Spirit
\add gives you\add*), while you sincerely and thankfully sing to God.
\s Colossians 3:17 
\s Do everything in the manner that those who are the people of the Lord Jesus should do.
\p
\v 17 Whatever you say, and whatever you do, do all of this in the manner that those who are representatives [MTY] of the Lord
Jesus \add should do\add*, while you constantly thank God, our Father, as you ask the Lord Jesus to take your prayers to God.
\s Colossians 3:18-19 
\s Wives, be subject to your husbands; husbands, love your wives.
\p
\v 18 You women, be subject to your husbands, since that is what you should do because you have a close relationship with the
Lord \add Jesus\add*. 
\v 19 You men, love your wives; in particular, do not be harsh with them.
\s Colossians 3:20-21 
\s Children, obey your parents in every circumstance; parents, do not over-correct your children.
\p
\v 20 You children, obey your parents in every circumstance, because the Lord
\add God\add* is pleased when you do that. 
\v 21 You parents (OR, you fathers), do not correct your children more than you need to, in order that they do not become
discouraged. 
\s Colossians 3:22-4:1 
\s Slaves, obey your masters in every circumstance sincerely and wholeheartedly; masters, provide for your slaves justly and
fairly. 
\p
\v 22 You slaves, obey your earthly masters in every circumstance. Do not obey your masters only when they are watching [MTY]
you, like those who \add merely\add* want to impress their masters favorably. Instead, obey your masters sincerely. Do this
because you reverence the Lord \add Jesus\add* (OR\add , God\add*).
\v 23 Whatever \add work\add* you do, work wholeheartedly. Work wholeheartedly, like those who are working for the Lord
\add Jesus\add*. Do not work like those who are working \add merely\add* for
\add their\add* masters, 
\v 24 because you know that it is the Lord who will \add properly/justly\add* repay you. That is, you will receive what God has
promised. \add Remember that\add* it is Christ who is the real master whom you are serving.
\v 25 But \add God\add* will judge impartially any of you who keeps doing wrong. He will judge you according to what you have
done that is wrong.
