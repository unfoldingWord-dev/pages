\s Revelation 8:1-5 
\s When the Lamb opened the seventh seal, it thundered, lightning flashed, and the earth shook.
\p
\v 1 When \add Jesus\add*, the \add one who is like a\add* lamb, opened the seventh seal, there was no sound at all in heaven
for ◄a very short time/about half an hour►. 
\v 2 I saw the seven angels who stand in front of God. A trumpet was given
{◄\add God/An angel\add*► gave a trumpet} to each one of them. 
\v 3 Another angel, who had a golden container for burning incense, came and stood at the altar.
\add He was given\add* {\add An angel\add* gave to him} a large quantity of incense, in order that he might offer it, with the
prayers of all God's people, upon the golden altar that is in front of
\add God's\add* throne. \add Then he burned this incense on the altar\add*.
\v 4 From the \add pot in\add* the angel's hand, the smoke of the incense, along with the prayers of God's people went up to
God. 
\v 5  \add In response\add*, the angel took the golden incense burner and filled it with
\add coals of\add* fire from the altar. He threw \add the contents
of\add* the [MTY] incense burner onto the earth. Thunder sounded and rumbled, lightning was flashing, and the earth shook.
\s Revelation 8:6-12 
\s The successive blasts by each of the first four trumpet angels resulted in great catastrophes on the earth and in the sky.
\p
\v 6 The seven angels, \add each\add* of which had \add one of\add* the seven trumpets, prepared to blow them.
\v 7 When the first angel blew his trumpet, hail and fire mixed with blood poured down onto the earth.
\add As a result\add*, a third of \add everything on the surface
of\add* the land was burned up {\add the fire\add* burned up a third of
\add everything on the surface of\add* the land}. A third of the trees were also burned up {It also burned up a third of the
trees}, and \add a third of\add* all the green grass was burned up.
\v 8 When the second angel blew his trumpet, something that was like a huge mountain burning with fire fell into the ocean.
\add As a result\add*, a third of the ocean became \add red like\add* [MTY] blood,
\v 9 a third of the living creatures in the ocean died, and a third of the ships
\add in the ocean\add* were destroyed. 
\v 10 When the third angel blew his trumpet, a huge star, which was burning like a torch, fell from the sky into a third of the
rivers and into \add a third of\add* the water springs. 
\v 11 The name of the star is Bitterness. \add As a result\add*, the water in a third
\add of the rivers and springs\add* became bitter, and many people died from
\add drinking\add* the water because it had become bitter. 
\v 12 When the fourth angel blew his trumpet, \add God\add* struck the sun, the moon, and the stars, so that they lost a third
of their light. The \add sun\add* also did not shine during a third of the day, and
\add the moon and stars did not shine during a third\add* of the night.
\s Revelation 8:13 
\s An eagle announced that rebellious people on earth would suffer greatly.
\p
\v 13 As I watched, I heard an eagle that was flying high in the sky, shouting in a loud voice, “Terrible things will happen to
\add rebellious\add* people who live on the earth as a result of
\add what will happen when\add* the three remaining angels blow their trumpets! They are about to blow them!”
