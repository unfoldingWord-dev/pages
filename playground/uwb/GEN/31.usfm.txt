\c 31  
\s Jacob's family fled from Laban 
\p
\v 1 Someone told Jacob that Laban's sons were complaining and saying, “Jacob has become very rich by taking everything [HYP]
that belonged to our father.” 
\v 2 And Jacob noticed that Laban was not acting friendly toward him as he had done before.
\v 3 Then Yahweh said to Jacob, “Go back to your country and your relatives, and I will help you there.”
\p
\v 4 So Jacob sent a message to Rachel and Leah, telling them to come out to the pastures where his flocks of sheep and goats
were. 
\v 5 When they arrived, he said to them, “I see that your father does not act friendly toward me as he did previously. But God,
whom my father worshiped, has helped me. 
\v 6 You two know that I have worked very hard for your father, 
\v 7 but many times [HYP] he has cheated me by decreasing my wages. But God has not allowed him to harm me.
\v 8 When Laban said, ‘The speckled animals are the ones that I will give you to be your wages,’ then all the animals gave
birth to young ones that were speckled. When he changed and said, ‘The ones that have black and white stripes on them will be
your wages,’ then all the animals gave birth to young ones that were striped.
\v 9 In that way, God has taken away the livestock that belonged to your father and has given them to me.
\p
\v 10 One time, when the animals were mating, I had a dream. In my dream I looked up and was surprised to see that some of the
male goats that were mating with the female goats had black and white stripes on them, some were speckled, and some were
spotted. 
\v 11 An angel who was sent by God said to me in the dream, ‘Jacob!’ I replied, ‘I am here!’
\v 12 He said to me, ‘Look up and you will see that all the male goats that are mating have black and white stripes on them, or
are speckled or spotted. This is happening because I have seen all that Laban has done to you.
\v 13 I am God who appeared to you at Bethel, where you set up a stone to show that the place was holy, and you poured olive
oil on the stone and made a solemn promise to me. So now leave this land immediately, and return to the land where you were
born.’ ” 
\p
\v 14 Rachel and Leah replied to him, “Our father will not give us anything more when he dies [RHQ].
\v 15 He treats us as though we were foreigners [RHQ]! Your working for him all these years was like a payment that you gave
him as a price for us, but we will not inherit any of that money that he got as a price for us. He has spent it all!
\v 16 Surely all of the wealth that God took away from our father belongs to us and to our children. So do whatever God has
told you to do!” 
\p
\v 17 Then Jacob put his children and his wives on camels. 
\v 18 He made all his livestock go ahead of him. Besides the livestock, he took along all the other things that he had acquired
while living in Paddan-Aram. And they prepared to return to his father Isaac, in Canaan land.
\p
\v 19 Before they left, while Laban was shearing his sheep, Rachel stole the small wooden idols that were in her father's tent.
\v 20 Furthermore, Jacob deceived Laban, who belonged to the Aram people-group, by not telling him that they were planning to
leave. 
\v 21 So Jacob and his family fled with all their possessions, and they crossed the Euphrates River, and then started traveling
south toward the hilly area of Gilead region. 
\s Jacob rebuked Laban after Laban caught up with him 
\p
\v 22 On the third day after they left, someone told Laban that Jacob and his family had left.
\v 23 So he took some of his relatives with him and started to pursue Jacob. They walked for seven days.
\v 24 Then God appeared to Laban in a dream at night. He said to him, “When you catch up to Jacob, be sure that you do not say
anything at all [HYP] to him in an angry manner!” 
\p
\v 25 The next day, by the time Laban caught up with Jacob, Jacob and his household had set up their tents in the hilly Gilead
area. So Laban and his relatives set up their tents there, too. 
\v 26 Then Laban went to Jacob and said to him, “Why have you done this? You have deceived me by carrying away my daughters as
though you had captured them in a war [MTY]! 
\v 27 Why did you run away and deceive me? Why did you not tell me that you were going to leave, so that we could have rejoiced
and sung while people played music on tambourines and harps before I said ‘goodbye’ to you?
\v 28 ◄You did not even let me kiss my grandchildren and my daughters goodbye before they left!/Why did you not allow me to
kiss my grandchildren and daughters goodbye before they left?► [RHQ] What you have done was foolish!
\v 29 My relatives and I have the power to harm you, but last night the God whom your father worships said to me in a dream,
‘Be sure that you do not say anything at all to Laban in an angry way.’
\v 30 Now, I know you have left because you long to go back home. But why did you steal my wooden idols?”
\p
\v 31 Jacob replied to Laban, saying, “I did not tell you that we were planning to leave, because I was afraid. I thought that
\add if I told you\add*, you would forcefully take your daughters away from me.
\v 32 But if you find anyone here who has your wooden idols, we will execute that person. While our relatives are watching,
search for yourself to see if there is anything that belongs to you that is here with me. If you find anything, you can take
it!” When Jacob said that, he did not know that Rachel had stolen the wooden idols.
\p
\v 33 Laban went into Jacob's tent, and then into Leah's tent, and then into the tents of the two female slaves and searched
for the idols, but he did not find them. After he left their tents, he entered Rachel's tent.
\v 34 But Rachel had previously taken the idols and put them in the saddle of a camel, and she was sitting on the saddle. So
when Laban searched all over for them inside Rachel's tent, he did not find them.
\v 35 Rachel said to her father, “Do not be angry with me, sir, but I cannot stand up in your presence
\add to show respect for you\add*, because I am having my monthly menstrual period. [EUP]” So when Laban searched some more, he
did not find the wooden idols. 
\p
\v 36 Then Jacob became angry. He rebuked Laban, saying, “What crime did I commit? For what sin that I committed have you
pursued me? 
\v 37 Now you have searched through all my possessions, and what did you find from all these possessions that belongs to you?
Put it here in front of my relatives and your relatives, so that they can decide who is right, you or me!
\p
\v 38 I was with you for twenty years. In all that time, your sheep and goats have ◄not miscarried/always given birth to
animals safely►. I have not \add killed and\add* eaten any rams from your flocks.
\v 39 When one of your animals was attacked and mauled/killed by a wild animal, I did not bring it to you. I replaced the dead
animal with a living one of my own animals. Whenever one of your animals was stolen, during the day or during the night, you
demanded that I replace it with one of my own animals. 
\v 40 I suffered from the heat during the day and from the cold at night. I was often not even able to sleep [PRS]!
\v 41 I lived in your household for twenty years. I worked for you for fourteen years to buy your two daughters, and for six
more years to buy some of your sheep and goats. During that time, you changed and reduced my wages many times [HYP].
\v 42 If God, the one whom my grandfather Abraham worshiped and before whom my father Isaac trembled in fear, had not been with
me and helped me, you would have sent me away ◄with nothing in my hands/owning nothing►! But God saw how much I was suffering
and how hard I was working, so last night he told you that what you have done to me was wrong.”
\s Jacob and Laban made a solemn promise not to harm each other 
\p
\v 43 Laban replied, “These two women are my daughters, and their children are my grandchildren, and the animals are my
animals. Everything you see here is mine [HYP]! But what can I do today to keep my daughters or the children they have given
birth to [RHQ]? 
\v 44 I cannot do anything in order to keep them, so hey, we should make a peace agreement, you and I, and do something that
will remind us about our agreement.” 
\p
\v 45 So Jacob took a \add large\add* stone and set it on its end.
\v 46 Then Jacob said to his relatives, “Gather some stones.” So they gathered some rocks and put them in a heap, and they ate
some food there near the heap. 
\v 47 Laban gave the heap the Aramaic name Jegar- Sahadutha, \add which means 'rock-pile to remind
us,'\add* but Jacob gave the rock-pile the Hebrew name Galeed, which has the same meaning.
\v 48 Laban said to Jacob, “This pile of rocks we have put here today will help us to remember our agreement.” That is why
Jacob called it Galeed. 
\v 49 They also named the place Mizpah, \add which sounds like the Hebrew word that means
'watchtower,'\add* because Laban said, “We will ask Yahweh to watch you and me while we are separated from each other,
\add so that we do not try to harm each other\add*. 
\v 50 If you mistreat my daughters, or if you take other women to be your wives, even if no one tells me about it, don't forget
that God sees what you and I are doing!” 
\p
\v 51 Laban also said to Jacob, “You see this large stone and this pile of rocks that we have set up to be between us.
\v 52 Both this pile of rocks and this large stone will remind us, that I will not go past these rocks to harm you, and you
will not go past these rocks to harm me. We will ask the God whom Abraham and his father Nahor worshiped to punish [MTY] either
one of us, if we harm the other one.” 
\p
\v 53 So Jacob solemnly promised to do what they said in their peace agreement. And he asked God, the one before whom his
father Isaac trembled, to listen to what they promised. 
\v 54 He offered a sacrifice to God there in the hilly area, and he invited his relatives to eat with him. After they had
eaten, they slept there that night. 
\v 55 The next morning Laban kissed his grandchildren and his daughters and asked God to bless them. Then he
\add and his men\add* left them and returned home.
