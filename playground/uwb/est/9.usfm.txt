\v 1 The first law that their king had commanded was to be made effective on March 7th. On that day the enemies of the Jews
hoped to get rid of them. But instead, on that same day the Jews defeated their enemies.
\v 2 Throughout the empire, the Jews gathered together in their cities to attack those who wanted to get rid of them. No one
could fight against the Jews, because all the other people in the areas where the Jews lived were afraid of the Jews,
\add so they did not want to help anyone who attacked the Jews\add*.
\v 3 All the governors and other officials and important people in all the provinces helped the Jews, because they were afraid
of Mordecai. 
\v 4 They were afraid of him because in all the provinces \add they knew
that\add* Mordecai was now the king's most important official, \add with the authority that Haman previously
had\add*. Mordecai was becoming more famous because \add the king was giving
him\add* more and more power. 
\v 5  \add On March 7th\add*, the Jews attacked and killed with their swords all of their enemies. They did whatever they
wanted to, to the people who hated them. 
\v 6 Just in Susa, the capital city, they killed 500 people. 
\v 7 Among those whom they killed were the ten sons of Haman. \add Their names
were\add* Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha, 
\v 8 Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha, 
\v 9 Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vaizatha. 
\v 10 Those were grandsons of Hammedatha and sons of Haman, the enemy of the Jews. The Jews killed them, but they did not take
the things that belonged to the people whom they killed. 
\v 11  \add At the end of\add* that day someone reported to the king the number of people whom the Jews killed in Susa.
\v 12 Then the king said to Queen Esther, “The Jews have killed 500 people here in Susa, including the ten sons of Haman!
\add So I think that\add* they must have killed many more people in the rest of my empire \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*!
\add But okay\add*, now what else do you want me to do for you. You tell me, and I will do it.”
\v 13 Esther replied, “If it pleases you, allow the Jews here in Susa to do again tomorrow
\add what you commanded them\add* to do today. And command that the bodies of Haman's ten sons be hanged on the gallows\f + \ft Or: poles \f*.”
\v 14 So the king commanded that the Jews be permitted to kill more of their enemies the next day. After he issued another
order in Susa, the bodies of Haman's ten sons were hanged. 
\v 15 On the next day, the Jews in Susa gathered together and killed 300 more people. But again, they did not take away the
things that belonged to the people whom they killed. 
\v 16 That happened on March 8th. On the following day, the Jews
\add in Susa\add* rested and celebrated. In all the other provinces, the Jewish people gathered together to defend themselves,
and they killed 75,000 people who hated them, but they also did not take the things that belonged to the people whom they
killed. 
\v 17 That occurred on March 7th, and on the following day they rested and celebrated.
\v 18 After the Jews in Susa gathered together \add and killed their
enemies\add* on March 7th and 8th, they rested and celebrated on March 9th.
\v 19 That is why \add every year\add*, on March 8th, the Jews who live in villages now celebrate
\add defeating their enemies\add*. They have feasts and give gifts
\add of food\add* to each other. 
\v 20 Mordecai wrote down all the things that had happened. Then he sent letters to the Jews who lived throughout the empire of
King Xerxes. 
\v 21 He told them that every year they should celebrate on the 8th and 9th of March,
\v 22 because those were the days when the Jews got rid of their enemies. He also told them that they should celebrate on those
days by feasting and giving gifts \add of food\add* to each other and to poor people. They would remember it as the month in
which they changed from being very sorrowful to being very joyful, from crying to celebrating.
\v 23 So the Jews agreed to do what Mordecai wrote. They agreed to celebrate on those days
\add every year\add*. 
\v 24  \add They would remember how\add* Haman, son of Hammedatha, a descendant of
\add King\add* Agag, became an enemy of all the Jews. \add They would
remember\add* how he had made an evil plan to kill the Jews, and that he had cast lots\f + \ft Or: thrown small marked stones \f* to choose
the day to kill \f + \ft doublet \f* them. 
\v 25  \add They would remember\add* that when Esther told the king about Haman's plan, the king arranged that the evil plan
that Haman had made to kill the Jews would fail, and that he \add would be
killed\add* instead of the Jews, and that Haman and that his sons were hanged.
\v 26 Because the lot\f + \ft Or: small marked stone \f* that Haman threw was called Pur, the Jews called these days Purim. And, because of
everything that Mordecai wrote\f + \ft Or: was written \f* in that letter, and because of all that happened to them,
\v 27 the Jews \add throughout the empire\add* agreed to celebrate in that manner on those two days every year. They said that
they would tell their descendants and those people who became Jews to be certain to celebrate this festival every year. They
should celebrate just as Mordecai told them to do \add in the letter\add* that he wrote.
\v 28 They said that they would remember and celebrate on those two days every year, in each family, in every city, and in
every province. They solemnly declared that they and their descendants would never stop remembering and celebrating those days
called Purim. 
\v 29 Then Mordecai and Queen Esther, who was the daughter of Abihail, wrote a second letter about the Purim feast. Esther used
the authority that she had because of being the queen to confirm that what Mordecai had written in the first letter was true.
\v 30-31 What they wrote \add in the second letter\add* was, “We wish that all of you will be living peacefully and
safely\f + \ft Or: righteously \f*. We want you and your descendants to celebrate Purim each year on the days that we two established, and to
do the things that we two told you to do.” In that letter, Queen Esther and Mordecai also gave them instructions about
fasting\f + \ft Or: abstaining from eating food \f* and being sorrowful. Then copies of that letter were sent to all the Jews who were living
in the 127 provinces of the empire. 
\v 32 The letter that Esther wrote about the manner in which they should celebrate the Purim feast was also written in an
official record.
