\s Haman planned to kill to the Jews 
\p
\v 1 Some time later, King Xerxes ◄promoted/gave his most important job/work to► Haman, the son of Hammedatha, who was a
descendant of \add King\add* Agag. Haman became more important than all his other officials.
\add Only the king was more important\add*. 
\v 2 Then the king commanded that all the other officials had to bow down in front of Haman to honor him
\add when he walked by\add*. But Mordecai refused to bow down to Haman.
\p
\v 3 The \add other\add* officials \add saw that, and\add* they asked Mordecai, “Why do you disobey what the king commanded?”
\v 4 Mordecai told them that he was a Jew, \add and that Jews would bow down only to
God\add*. Day after day the other officials spoke to Mordecai about that, but he still refused to obey. So they told Haman
about it, to see if Haman would tolerate it. 
\p
\v 5 When Haman saw that Mordecai would not bow down to him, he became extremely angry.
\v 6  \add After he found out that Mordecai was a Jew\add*, he decided that it would not be enough to get rid of only Mordecai.
He decided to kill all the Jews in all the area that Xerxes ruled.
\p
\v 7 So, during the twelfth year that Xerxes was ruling, during the month of April,
\add Haman told his advisors to\add* ◄cast lots/throw small marked stones► to determine the best month and the best day to kill
the Jews. Haman's advisors did that, and the day that was selected was March 7th
\add during the following/next year\add*. 
\p
\v 8 Then Haman \add went to\add* the king and said to him, “\add Your
majesty\add*, there is a certain group of people who live in many areas
\add of your empire\add* whose customs are different from ours. They even refuse to obey your laws. So it would be good for you
to get rid of them. 
\v 9 If it pleases you, command that they should all be killed. \add If you do
that\add*, I will give ◄375 tons/750,000 pounds► of silver to your administrators so that you can use it for your government.”
\p
\v 10 The king liked \add what Haman said, so, and to confirm what he
decided\add*, he gave the ring that had his official seal on it to Haman, who now hated the Jews.
\v 11 The king told Haman, “Keep your money, but do what you want to with those people
\add whom you talked about\add*!” 
\p
\v 12 On April 17th Haman summoned the king's secretaries, and he dictated a letter to them that they
\add translated and\add* wrote to all the governors and administrators and other officials in all the provinces. They wrote
copies of the letter in every language and every kind of writing/alphabet that was used in the empire. They wrote that all the
Jews, \add including\add* young people and old people, women and children, had to be killed on one day. That day was March 7th
\add of the following year\add*. They also wrote that \add those who killed the
Jews\add* could take everything that belonged to the Jews. \add They
signed\add* the king's name \add at the end of\add* the letters. Then they sealed the letters
\add with wax, and stamped the wax by\add* using the king's ring.
\v 13 Then they \add prepared to\add* send the letters to every province in the empire, in order that everyone would be ready.
\p
\v 14 The king \add also commanded that\add* copies of these letters should be
\add nailed up\add* where \add all the people\add* could see them, in every province, so that the people would be ready to do
on the day the king had set \add what was written in the letter\add*.
\v 15 Then, according to what the king commanded, men \add riding
horses\add* took these letter quickly to every province \add in the
empire\add*. And one of the letters was read \add aloud to the people\add* in the capital city, Susa. Then the king and Haman
sat down and drank \add wine\add*, but the people in Susa were very perplexed
\add about why this was going to happen\add*.
