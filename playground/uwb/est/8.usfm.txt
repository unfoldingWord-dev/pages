\c 8  
\s The king issued a decree to save the Jews 
\p
\v 1  \add Later\add* on that same day, King Xerxes \add declared
that\add* everything that Haman, the enemy of the Jews, owned, would now belong to Queen Esther. Esther told the king that
Mordecai was her cousin. When the king \add heard that\add*, \add he sent a message to
tell\add* Mordecai to come in. 
\v 2 When Mordecai came in, the king took off the ring that had his official seal on it, the ring that he had
\add previously\add* given to Haman, and gave it to Mordecai, \add to indicate that Mordecai was now his most important
official\add*. And Esther appointed Mordecai to be in charge of everything that had belonged to Haman.
\p
\v 3 Esther again came to talk to the king. She prostrated herself at his feet, crying. She
\add wanted to\add* plead for him to stop what Haman had planned, to kill all the Jews.
\v 4 The king held out his gold scepter\f + \ft Or: staff \f* toward Esther, so Esther arose and stood in front of him.
\v 5 She said, “Your majesty, if you are pleased with me, and if you think that it is the right thing to do, make a new law to
cancel what Haman decreed, that all the Jews in all the provinces in your empire should be killed.
\v 6 I cannot endure seeing all my family and \add all the rest of\add* my people killed.”
\v 7 King Xerxes replied to Queen Esther and Mordecai, “Because Haman tried to get rid of all the Jews, I have given to Esther
everything that belonged to Haman, and I have ordered \add my soldiers\add* to hang Haman.
\v 8 So now I am also permitting you to write other letters, \add to
save\add* your people. You may put my name on the letters, and use my ring to seal them because no letter that has my name on
it and which is sealed with my ring can ever be changed.” 
\v 9 Then the king summoned his secretaries, on June 25th, and \add Mordecai told them
to\add* write letters to the Jews and to all the governors and other officials in all of the 127 provinces, which extended from
India \add in the east\add* to Ethiopia \add in the west\add*. They wrote these letters in all the languages that the people in
each area spoke. They also wrote letters to the Jewish people, in their language.
\v 10-11 They wrote in those letters that the Jews in every city were permitted by the king to gather together to protect
themselves. They also were permitted to kill any group of soldiers who attacked them. They were also permitted to kill the
women and children of those who attacked them, and to take the possessions of the people whom they killed.
\v 12  \add All this was to be done\add* on March 7th of the following year. Mordecai signed the king's name on the letters,
and sealed them with the seal that was on the king's ring. Then he gave them to messengers, who rode on fast horses that had
been raised especially for the king. 
\v 13 Copies of this law were to be nailed to posts in every province and read to all the people, in order that the Jews would
be ready to get revenge on\f + \ft Or: fight against \f* their enemies on March 7th.
\v 14 The king commanded the men who took these letters \add to all the
provinces\add* to ride quickly on the king's horses. And copies of the letter were also posted and read to the people in
\add the capital city\add*, Susa. 
\v 15  \add Before Mordecai left the palace\add*, he put on the blue and white robe and a large gold crown that the king gave
him. He also put on a coat made of fine purple cloth. When the people in Susa heard the new law, they all shouted and cheered.
\v 16 The Jews in Susa were very happy, and other people honored them.
\v 17 And when the new law arrived in every city and province, the Jews there celebrated and prepared feasts and were very
joyful. And many people throughout the empire \add were circumcised
and\add* became Jews, because they were now afraid of what the Jews
\add would do to them if they were not Jews\add*.
