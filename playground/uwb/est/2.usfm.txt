\s Esther became the new queen 
\p
\v 1 After a while, King Xerxes quit being so angry. He thought about Vashti, and he thought about the law he had made because
of what she \add had done, and he wanted another wife\add*. 
\v 2 So his personal servants said to him, "\add Your majesty\add*, you should send some men to go throughout the empire to
search to find some beautiful young women\f + \ft Or: virgins \f* for you. 
\v 3  \add After they find some\add*, you can appoint some officials in each province to bring them to the place where you keep
your wives\f + \ft Or: the women you sleep with \f* here in Susa. Then Hegai, the man who is in charge of these women, can arrange for
ointments to be put \add on their bodies\add* to make them \add more\add* beautiful.
\v 4 Then the woman who pleases you most can become queen instead of Vashti." The king liked what they suggested, so he did it.
\p
\v 5 At that time there was a Jew \add living\add* in Susa, the capital, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair. Jair was a
descendant of Shimei. Shimei was a descendant of \add King Saul's
father\add* Kish. They were all from the tribe descended from Benjamin.
\v 6  \add Many years before that\add*, King Nebuchadnezzar had taken Mordecai\f + \ft Or: Mordecai's family \f*
\add and brought them from Jerusalem\add* to Babylon, at the same time he brought King Jehoiachin of Judah and many other
people to Babylon. 
\v 7 Mordecai had a cousin whose \add Hebrew\add* name was Hadassah. She had a beautiful face and beautiful body\f + \ft Or: figure \f*. Her
\add Persian\f + \ft Or: Babylonian \f*\add* name was Esther. After her father and mother died, Mordecai took care of Esther as though she were
his own daughter. 
\v 8 After the king commanded \add that they search for some beautiful
women\add*, they brought Esther and many other young women to the king's palace
\add in Susa\add*, and the king put Hegai\f + \ft Or: Hegai was put \f* in charge of them.
\v 9 Hegai was very pleased with Esther, and he treated her well. He immediately arranged for her to be given ointments
\add to make her more beautiful\add*, and \add he ordered\add* that special food
\add would be given to her\add*. \add He arranged that\add* seven maids from the king's palace
\add would take care of her\add*, and arranged that she\f + \ft Or: they \f* would stay in the best rooms.
\p
\v 10 Esther did not tell anyone that she was a Jew, because Mordecai had told her not to tell anyone.
\v 11 Every day Mordecai walked near the courtyard of the place where those women stayed. He asked
\add people who entered the courtyard\add* to find out \add and tell
him\add* what was happening to Esther. 
\p
\v 12 Before these women were taken to the king, for one year they put ointments on
\add the bodies of\add* these women to make them more beautiful. For six months they
\add rubbed olive\add* oil mixed with myrrh \add on their bodies each
day\add*. For \add the next\add* six months they rubbed ointments and perfumes on their bodies.
\v 13 Then, when one of these women \add was summoned to\add* go to the king, she was allowed to wear whatever clothes and
jewelry she chose. 
\v 14 In the evening, they would take her \add to the king's own
room\add*. The next morning, they would take her to another place where the women
\add who had slept with the king\add* stayed. There another official whose name was Shaashgaz was in charge
\add of those women\add*. \add Those women would live there for the rest of their lives,
and\add* one of those women would go back to the king again only if the king very much wanted her to come again, and only if he
told Shaashgaz the name of the woman. 
\p
\v 15-16 Everyone who saw Esther liked her. After King Xerxes had been ruling for seven years, it was Esther's turn to go to
him. When they took her to the king, it was during the middle part of the winter. She wore only the things that Hegai
suggested. 
\v 17 The king liked Esther more than he liked any of the other women
\add that they brought to him\add*. He liked her so much that he put on her head the crown
\add that Vashti wore previously\add*, and he declared that Esther would be the queen instead of Vashti.
\v 18 To celebrate her \add becoming the queen\add*, he had a big banquet\f + \ft Or: feast \f* prepared for all his administrators and
\add other\add* officials. He generously gave \add nice\add* gifts to everyone, and he declared that in all the provinces there
would be a holiday, a time when people did not have to pay taxes.
\p
\v 19 Later all those women who had spent a night with the king were gathered together again. By that time Mordecai had become
an official at the palace. 
\v 20 But Esther still did not tell anyone that she was a Jew. She continued to do what Mordecai had told her to do.
\v 21 One day when Mordecai was doing his work in the palace, two of the king's officials were there. Their names were Bigthana
and Teresh. They were the guards who stood outside the king's own rooms. They became angry
\add with the king\add*, and they were planning how they could assassinate\f + \ft Or: kill \f* him.
\v 22 But Mordecai heard about what they were planning, and he told that to Queen Esther. Then she told the king what Mordecai
had found out. 
\v 23 The king investigated it and found out that Mordecai's report was true. So the king ordered that those two men be hanged.
When that was done, an official wrote a report\f + \ft Or: a report was written \f* about it in a book called 'The book that records what
happened while Xerxes was king.'
