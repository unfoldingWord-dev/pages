\c 4  
\s Mordecai requested help from Esther 
\p
\v 1 When Mordecai found out about \add those letters\add*, he \add was so anguished
that\add* he tore his clothes and put on \add rough\add* sackcloth and
\add threw\add* ashes over himself. Then he went into the city, crying very loudly.
\v 2 He stood outside the gate of the palace, because no one who was wearing sackcloth was allowed to enter the palace.
\v 3 In every province \add of the empire\add*, when the letter from the king was read to the Jewish people, they cried and
mourned. They ◄fasted/abstained from eating food►, and wailed loudly. Many of them also put on sackcloth and threw ashes on
themselves and lay \add on the ground\add*. 
\v 4 When Esther's maids and other officials came to her and told her what Mordecai had done, she was very distressed. So she
sent to Mordecai \add some good\add* clothes to wear instead of the sackcloth, but he refused to take them.
\v 5 Then Esther summoned Hathach, one of the king's officials whom he had appointed to help take care of Esther. She told him
to go \add out and talk\add* to Mordecai to find out what was distressing him and why
\add he was wearing sackcloth to show\add* that he was grieving.
\v 6 Hathach went to Mordecai, who was in the plaza in front of the palace gate.
\v 7 Mordecai told him everything that had happened. He told him how much money Haman had promised to give to the government if
the king commanded that all the Jews be killed. 
\v 8 Mordecai also gave to Hathach a copy of the decree that had been read in Susa,
\add which said\add* that \add all the Jews\add* must be killed.
\add He told Hathach to\add* show the copy to Esther. \add He told
Hathach\add* to explain to Esther what ◄it meant/would happen►. Then he told him to urge her to go to the king and request the
king to act mercifully to her people. 
\v 9 So Hathach returned to Esther and told her what Mordecai said.
\v 10 Then Esther told Hathach to \add return to\add* Mordecai and tell this to him:
\v 11 “There is a law \add about people going to talk to the king\add*. All the king's officials and all the people in the
empire know this law. \add In that law it states that\add* anyone who goes to the king when the king has not held out his gold
scepter/staff toward him must be executed. Only those to whom the king has extended his scepter/staff will not be executed. And
a month has passed since the king has held out his scepter/staff toward me,
\add so I do not think he will let me talk to him now\add*. (OR,
\add what will happen to me if I try to see him and he doesn't want to see
me\add*?)” 
\v 12 So Hathach \add went back to\add* Mordecai and told him what Esther had said.
\v 13 Mordecai \add told Hathach to\add* tell this to Esther: “Do not think that just because you live there in the palace, you
will escape when all the other Jews \add are killed\add*. 
\v 14 If you say nothing now, someone from some other place will rescue
\add some of\add* us Jews, but you and your relatives will be killed. Furthermore, ◄perhaps
\add God\add*/who knows if \add God\add*► has put you here \add as
queen\add* ◄for a situation like this/to prevent this from happening to us►!” \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*
\v 15 Then \add after Hathach told this to Esther\add*, she \add told
him\add* to return to Mordecai and say this to him: 
\v 16 “Gather together all the Jews here in Susa, and tell them to ◄fast/abstain from food► for my sake. Tell them to not eat
or drink anything for three days and nights. My maids and I will also fast. Then, I will go to talk to the king. Even if ◄I am
executed/they execute me► for disobeying the law by \add seeing him when he does not hold out the scepter/staff toward me, I am
willing for that.”\add* 
\v 17 So \add after Hathach told this to Mordecai\add*, Mordecai went and did what Esther told him to do.
