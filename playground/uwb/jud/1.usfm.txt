\v 1  \add I am\add* Jude. I \add serve\add* Jesus Christ \add like\add* a voluntary slave \f + \fr metaphor \f*. I am a
\add younger\add* brother of James, \add the leader of all the congregations. I am
writing\add* to you whom \add God\add* has chosen \add to belong to him. You
are\add* loved by God \add our\add* Father and protected by Jesus Christ (OR, whom
\add God\add* has protected \add to present\add* to Jesus Christ).
\v 2  \add I pray that\add* you will continue to \add experience\add* very much
\add God acting\add* mercifully toward you, \add causing you to have
inner\add* peace, and loving \add you\add*. 
\s Jude 3-4 
\s Proclaim the truth that we believe and strongly defend it against those who oppose it.
\p
\v 3 You whom I love, I ◄was very eager/very much wanted► to write to you about that which we all ◄share/have in common►, which
is how ◄\add God/Jesus Christ\add*► \add has\add* saved \add us\add*. But now I realize that it is necessary
\add for me\add* to write to you in order to exhort you to defend the
\add truth about Christ\add* that we believe. \add Jesus and his
apostles\add* gave that truth once for all to us who belong to God,
\add and we must not let it be changed\add* {\add anyone revise/change
it\add*}. 
\v 4 Some people falsely \add teach that because\add* God kindly does for us what we do not deserve, it ◄does not matter/is all
right► if we continue to sin. \add Those people show by the way that they conduct their
lives\add* that they do not want to admit/accept that Jesus Christ
\add is\add* our only Master and Lord. \add It was written\add* long ago
{\add Someone\add* long ago wrote} that \add God\add* would condemn ◄such ungodly people/people like that whose lives are
displeasing to him►. But some \add of those\add* people have entered \f + \fr metaphor \f*
\add like crawling snakes\add* into your congregations \add and oppose the truth about Christ, so you must resist/oppose
them\add*. 
\s Jude 5-8 
\s How God destroyed three groups illustrates that he will destroy these ungodly people in your midst.
\p
\v 5 Although you previously knew all these things, \add there are certain things
about\add* which I desire to remind you\add . Do not forget that
although\add* the Lord rescued \add his people\add* from Egypt \add country\add*, he later destroyed most of those same people,
ones who did not believe \add in him\add*. 
\v 6 And there were \add many\add* angels to \add whom God assigned/gave positions of authority in
heaven\add*. But they did not continue to rule with authority \add in those
positions\add*. Instead, they abandoned the place that \add God\add* gave them to live
\add in heaven\add*. So God has put those angels in chains forever in the darkness
\add in hell. They will stay there\add* until the great day when
\add God\add* will judge \add and punish\add* them. 
\v 7 Similarly, the people who lived \f + \fr metonymy \f* in Sodom and Gomorrah
\add cities\add* and the nearby cities committed sexual immorality. They sought all kinds of sexual relations that differ
\add from what God permits. So God destroyed their cities. What happened to those people and those
angels\add* shows that \add God will\add* punish \add people, such as the ones who teach false
doctrine\add*, in the eternal fire \add of hell\add*. 
\v 8 Similarly, these \add ungodly people in your midst\add* also defile their own bodies
\add by living immorally\add*, because \add they claim/say that God
revealed\add* in visions \add that they should act that way\add*. They refuse to
\add allow\add* anyone to have authority over them, and they ◄revile/speak evil about►
\add God's\add* glorious/wonderful \add angels\add*. 
\s Jude 9-10 
\s Those teachers of false doctrine revile the spiritual beings that they do not understand. But God will destroy them.
\p
\v 9 When ◄the devil/Satan► argued with the chief angel, Michael, about
\add who would take away\add* the body of \add the prophet\add* Moses
\add to bury it\add*, Michael did not \add do as these teachers of false doctrine do. Even though Michael has much more
authority than they do\add*, he did not disrespectfully ◄revile/say evil things to► Satan and accuse/condemn him. Instead, he
\add only\add* said, “\add I desire that\add* the Lord \add God\add* will rebuke you!”
\v 10 But the \add ones in your midst\add* who teach false doctrine ◄revile/speak evil against► the
\add spiritual\add* beings that they do not understand. They also
\add do the evil things that they desire\add*, things that they know about ◄naturally/without needing to think►, things that
they just do without considering\add the consequences/results\add*, like animals. So they destroy themselves.
\add But they will also be punished by God\add* {\add God will also\add* punish them}.
\s Jude 11-13 
\s Because the teachers of false doctrine do wicked things, God will condemn them to hell. They are dangerous, useless,
spiritually dead, restless, shameless, and unreliable. 
\p
\v 11  \add God will do\add* terrible things to those who teach false doctrine! They conduct their lives
\add wickedly\add* like Cain, \add who murdered his brother because he
was\add* ◄\add jealous/angry because God accepted his brother's sacrifice and did not accept
his\add*►. They ◄devote themselves to \f + \fr metaphor \f* \add doing\add* wrong things
\add like\add* Balaam, who \add tried to induce God's people to sin in order to get the money that was offered to
him\add*. They will perish like Korah, who rebelled \add against the authority that God gave to
Moses\add*►. 
\v 12 Those teachers of false doctrine are \add as dangerous to you
as\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f* ◄hidden rocks on a reef/rocks underneath the surface of the ocean►
\add are to a boat\add*. When you gather together \add to eat the meals
that\add* help you believers to love each other more and have a closer relationship with each other, they
\add join you and\add* carouse shamelessly, caring \add only\add* for themselves
\add and not for others. Because they do not do anything to help
others\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f*, they are \add as useless as\add* clouds that are blown along by the wind {that the wind blows along} but
that do not \add produce/give\add* any rain. \add They are as disappointing
as\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f* trees that do not produce fruit in the autumn \add as we expect them
to\add*. They are not only \add spiritually\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f* dead themselves,
\add but they are\add* not \add able to cause others to be\add* alive
\add spiritually, just like\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f* trees that have been {that
\add someone\add* has} uprooted and \add as a result\add* are unable to produce any fruit.
\v 13 They are \add restless\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f*, \add like\add* the pounding waves of the ocean.
\add Just like\add* waves \add produce foul-smelling\add* foam on the shore,
\add those teachers of false doctrine do\add* shameful \f + \fr metonymy \f* \add deeds. We cannot depend/rely on them to show us how to
conduct our lives\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f*, \add just like we cannot depend/rely
on\add* ◄meteors/falling stars► \add to show us the way when we travel\add*.
\add God\add* has reserved intense darkness for them forever \add in
hell\add*. 
\s Jude 14-16 
\s Enoch prophesied that the Lord will condemn people like the wicked teachers of false doctrine. They grumble, are discontent,
and are arrogant flatterers. 
\p
\v 14 Enoch, the sixth \add person in the line of people who descended\add* from Adam, prophesied this about those
\add teachers of false doctrine\add*: “Listen carefully to this: The Lord will certainly come with a countless number of his
holy \add angels\add* in order 
\v 15 to judge everyone, and to punish all wicked and ◄ungodly people/people whose lives are displeasing to God► for all the
◄ungodly things/things that displease God► that they did in ◄an ungodly way/a way that displeases God►, and for all the harsh
things that ungodly sinful people have spoken against him.” 
\v 16 Those \add teachers\add* of \add false doctrine\add* grumble
\add about\add* the \add things that God does\add*. They complain
\add about what happens to them\add*. They do the sinful things that
their\add bodies\add* desire. They talk boastfully. They ◄flatter/say nice things to► people, only in order to get
\add those people to give them the\add* things that they want. 
\s Jude 17-19 
\s The apostles predicted that wicked people like the teachers of false doctrine would come. They divide believers, are
self-directed, and devoid of God's Spirit. 
\p
\v 17 But you people whom I love need to remember the things that were predicted by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ {that
the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ said would happen}. 
\v 18 They told you, “In the final period of time \add in which we are now
living\add* there will be people who will laugh at \add the truths that God has
revealed\add*. They will do the ◄ungodly things/things that are displeasing to God► that their
\add bodies\add* desire.” 
\v 19  \add That describes\add* the teachers of false doctrine\add well,
because\add* they are the ones who cause \add believers\add* to divide among themselves. They do what their own minds tell them
to do. The Spirit \add of God\add* does not live within them. 
\s Jude 20-21 
\s Believe the truth more firmly, pray by the power of the Spirit, and keep expecting God's mercy.
\p
\v 20 But you people whom I love, ◄establish yourselves/continue to trust► firmly in the very sacred truths that you believe.
Pray by \add letting\add* the Holy Spirit enable/empower you. 
\v 21 Keep conducting your lives in \add a way that is appropriate for those
whom\add* God loves. Keep constantly expecting that our Lord Jesus Christ will
\add act\add* mercifully toward you. Keep expecting that until \add the time when we
begin\add* living eternally \add with him\add*. 
\s Jude 22-23 
\s Mercifully help those who are not certain what to believe, save those who are in danger of being influenced by the teachers
of false doctrine, and pity those completely convinced by them. 
\p
\v 22 Mercifully \add help\add* those who are not certain \add what teaching they should
believe\add*. 
\v 23  \add Rescue\add* others from \add the influence of those who teach what is
false\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f*, \add as you would rescue things by\add* snatching
\add them from\add* a fire. Pity those \add whom the teachers of false doctrine have completely
convinced\add*, but beware that \add you are not influenced by them\add* {that they do not influence you}. Detest
\add doing or even thinking about the sins that those people commit, just like you would
detest\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f* touching not only filthy things but the clothes that were stained by those things {that those things
stained}. 
\s Jude 24-25 
\s God, who is able to keep you from being condemned for your sin and to present you guiltless before him, was great and ruled
before time began, is still like that, and will remain so forever.
\p
\v 24 God is able to keep you from ceasing to trust in him (OR, from sinning), and he is able to present you before his
glorious presence. \add In his presence\add*, there will be nothing
\add for which\add* you \add will\add* be condemned {\add he can\add* condemn you}, and you will be rejoicing greatly.
\v 25 He is the only true God. He has saved us as a result of what Jesus Christ our Lord
\add did for us\add*. God was glorious and great and mighty and he
\add ruled\add* with great authority before time began. \add He is still like
that\add*, and \add he will remain like that\add* forever! ◄Amen!/That is true!►
