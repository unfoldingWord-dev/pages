\c 5  
\s 1 Timothy 5:1-25 
\s I instruct you how to act toward various groups in the church.
\p
\v 1 Do not rebuke/scold older men. Instead, exhort/advise them \add respectfully\add* as you would
\add exhort/advise\add* your father. Exhort/advise younger men \add gently\add* as you would exhort/advise your brothers.
\v 2  \add Exhort/advise\add* older women \add respectfully\add* as
\add you would exhort/advise\add* your mother. \add Exhort/advise\add* younger women
\add gently\add* as \add you would exhort/advise\add* your sisters; but you must act in a completely proper way as you do that.
\p
\v 3  \add Make sure that the congregation\add* respects widows who have no one to care for them.
\add They should respect them by taking care of them\add*. 
\v 4 If a widow has children or grandchildren, these \add children or
grandchildren\add* should learn that they are to respect their own family first. By doing that they can repay their parents and
grandparents for all that they did for them when they were young, because doing that pleases God.
\v 5 The widows who are really alone and have no one \add to help
them\add* confidently expect that God \add will help them\add*. So night and day they pray, earnestly asking [DOU]
\add God that he will help them and others\add*. 
\v 6 But widows who just want to have a lot of pleasure are \add spiritually\add* [MET] dead, although they are
\add physically\add* alive. 
\v 7 And tell \add the congregation\add* that \add the children or grandchildren should
do\add* these things in order that \add no one\add* can ◄criticize the believers/say that the believers are doing anything that
is wrong►. 
\v 8 If anyone does not take care of those who live in his own house, and especially if he does not take care of his own
family, he has ◄denied/quit believing► what we believe and \add we should consider
that\add* he is worse than a person who does not believe \add in
Christ\add*. 
\p
\v 9  \add You have a list of\add* widows \add who will do work for the congregation and receive
money\add*. Put women's names on the list \add only if\add* they are more than sixty years old, and if they were faithful to
their husbands. 
\v 10  \add Put women's names on that list only\add* if it is known that they have zealously/wholeheartedly done every kind of
good deed, if they have helped \add children\add* who were afflicted/suffering, if they have ◄brought up/cared for► their
children \add properly/well\add*, if they have welcomed and cared for guests, and if they have humbly served [MTY] other
believers. 
\v 11 As for younger widows, do not put their names on that list, because they
\add promise to do work for the congregation, but instead of doing that, they
usually\add* want to marry \add again\add* (OR, marry an unbeliever) when they have strong desires.
\v 12 If that happens, they may become guilty of not having done what they had promised
\add to do for the congregation\add* (OR, promised \add Christ that they would
do\add*.) 
\v 13 In addition, they \add generally\add* become lazy. Specifically, as they
\add just\add* go about from house to house they also begin ◄to gossip/to talk about people► and to meddle in other people's
affairs, saying what they should not say. 
\v 14 So I advise that \add instead of putting the names of younger widows on the list,
they\add* marry again, that they bear/have children, that they manage their homes
\add well\add*, and that they do nothing about which an enemy can say bad things about
\add them\add*. 
\v 15  \add I say this\add* because some \add younger widows\add* have stopped
\add obeying Christ\add* in order to obey Satan. 
\p
\v 16 If any woman who believes \add in Christ\add* has widows \add in her
household/family\add*, she should take care of them. The congregation should not be burdened by having {She should not depend
on the congregation} to take care of their \add needs\add*. The congregation should take care of the widows who truly
\add have no one to care for them\add*. 
\p
\v 17  \add Each congregation\add* should pay well the elders who lead
\add well. They should\add* greatly honor them, especially those who preach and those who teach.
\v 18  \add Long ago Moses\add* wrote in the Scriptures, “While an ox is
threshing\add grain\add*, you must not tie its mouth \add so that it cannot eat the
grain\add*,” and \add Jesus said\add*, “\add People\add* should pay those who work
\add for their benefit\add*.” \add So we know that congregations should support their
elders\add*. 
\p
\v 19 When some person accuses an elder \add about doing wrong\add*, accept what he says only if there are
\add at least\add* two or three persons who ◄testify/say \add that\add*►
\add they saw him do that wrong\add*. 
\p
\v 20 But as for any \add elder\add* who repeatedly sins, rebuke him before the whole congregation, in order that the rest
\add of the elders\add* will be afraid \add to sin\add*. 
\p
\v 21 I solemnly tell you that \add as you keep in mind that\add* God and Christ Jesus and the holy angels know everything that
you do, obey these commands \add about elders\add*! \add As you consider what others say about an elder doing
wrong\add*, do not easily/quickly decide that what they say is true. And treat them all equally.
\p
\v 22 Do not be in a hurry to put your hands on a man ◄\add to set him apart/to appoint
him\add*► \add as an elder. Wait until you have examined him to see how he conducts his
life\add*, because \add God will consider\add* that you are responsible if
\add you approve\add* a person who sins, saying that he should \add become an
elder\add*. Keep your life pure in every way. 
\v 23  \add And Timothy\add*, no longer drink \add only\add* water, but instead, drink a little wine
\add also\add*, because \add that may help to cure\add* your stomach's frequent illnesses.
\v 24  \add I tell you not\add* ◄\add to set apart/appoint\add*►
\add elders hastily, without seeing how they conduct their lives,
because\add* some people \add sin secretly\add*, so that it is not known what they have done until after someone examines them
(OR, before God judges them). But some people sin openly, so that people know what they have done before anyone examines them.
\v 25 Similarly, although \add some people\add* do good deeds openly, with the result that people know what they have done,
some people \add do good deeds secretly\add*, yet the good deeds that they have done cannot remain secret either.
