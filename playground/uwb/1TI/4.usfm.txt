\c 4  
\s 1 Timothy 4:1-16 
\s Take heed that you conduct yourself well and that you teach the true doctrine.
\p
\v 1  \add God's\add* Spirit has clearly told us that in later times some people will stop believing the
\add teaching\add* that \add all of us\add* believe. Instead, they will listen to
\add evil\add* spirits who deceive \add people. They will also believe the
false\add* doctrines/teachings that \add they receive from\add* these evil spirits.
\v 2 The people who teach those false doctrines/teachings are liars! And they do not feel at all guilty [MET]
\add when they teach such teachings!\add* 
\v 3  \add For example\add*, they forbid that \add believers\add* marry
\add because they say that it makes us unacceptable to God\add*. They also
\add command\add* that people abstain from \add eating certain\add* foods. But God created such foods in order that we can eat
them! We who believe \add in Christ\add* know the true \add teaching\add*, and we thank
\add God for the food that he gives us. That is why we\add* can eat it.
\v 4  \add We can eat all kinds of food\add* because God has created all
\add food\add*, and it is all good. We should not refuse to eat certain kinds of food if we thank
\add God for it\add* when we eat it. 
\v 5 It is acceptable \add to God\add* because God \add long ago\add* said
\add that all things that he made are good\add*, and because we pray that God will bless it.
\p
\v 6 When you teach these things to your fellow believers, you will be showing that you,
\add whom\add* Christ Jesus \add appointed\add*, serve them well. You will have become strong
\add spiritually\add* ◄by holding fast/by obeying► the true message that
\add we all\add* believe. 
\v 7 You must completely reject godless, silly/foolish stories \add from your ancestors that old people
tell\add*. Keep training yourself so that you have more ◄godly behavior/behavior that pleases God►.
\v 8  \add Some people say\add*, “It helps us in some ways if we exercise our bodies.” But
\add I say that\add* people benefit very much if they live ◄in a godly way/in a way that pleases God►, because
\add if people live in a godly way, that\add* will benefit them both while they live now and when they live in the future life
\add in heaven\add*. 
\v 9 Those are words that are absolutely true, and everybody should accept them!
\v 10 This is the reason why we work so hard [DOU] \add for others\add*, because we confidently expect that God, who is
all-powerful, \add will do the things that he has promised\add*. He is the one who
\add wants to\add* save all people, \add so he protects them\add*. He certainly
\add protects us\add* who believe \add in Christ!\add* 
\v 11 Command these things and teach these things. 
\p
\v 12  \add Timothy\add*, by the way you conduct your life, show the believers
\add in your congregation\add* how they should conduct their lives. Specifically, speak
\add good things\add*, conduct yourself \add well\add*, love \add people\add*, trust
\add God\add*, and be pure in every way. If you do all that, no one will
\add have any reason\add* ◄to belittle/to treat you disrespectfully► because of your being young.
\v 13 Until I come, be sure that you read \add the Scriptures to the
congregation\add* and that you exhort/urge them \add to obey the
Scriptures\add*, and teach them. 
\v 14 Do not neglect \add to use\add* the \add abilities that God\add* gave to you as a result of
\add people/us\add* ◄prophesying/telling what God revealed to them►
\add about you\add* and as a result of the elders putting their hands on you
\add to commission/appoint you to do God's work\add*. 
\v 15 Do these things \add that I have told\add* you to do! ◄Concentrate on them/Do them
\add sincerely and\add* wholeheartedly► in order that everyone may see that you are improving
\add in how you do them\add*. 
\p
\v 16 Be careful that you \add conduct\add* yourself well. By continuing to do that, you will save yourself. And if you
continue \add to teach the good\add* doctrine/teaching, the result of your teaching will be that
\add God\add* will save the people who listen to you.
