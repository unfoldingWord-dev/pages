\s MARK 16:1-8 
\s Two days later several women were astonished to find Jesus' tomb empty.
\p
\v 1  \add On Saturday evening\add* when ◄the Sabbath/the Jewish day of rest► had ended, Mary
\add from\add* Magdala \add village\add*, Mary the mother of the
\add younger\add* James, and Salome bought fragrant ointment. \add The Jews had a custom
of\add* anointing bodies \add before they buried them, and the women wanted to follow this
custom\add*. 
\v 2 So very early on Sunday, \add just after\add* the sun rose, they
\add took the fragrant ointment\add* and started toward the tomb.
\v 3  \add While they were going there\add*, they were saying to each other, “Who will roll away for us the stone
\add that blocks\add* the entrance of the tomb?” 
\v 4  \add After they arrived\add*, they looked up and saw that the stone had
\add already\add* been rolled away {that someone had \add already\add* rolled away the stone}.
\add They were surprised because it\add* would have been difficult to move such a huge stone.
\v 5 They entered the tomb and saw \add an angel who looked like\add* a young man. He was sitting at the right side
\add of the cave\add*. He was wearing a \add shining\add* white robe. As a result, they were astonished.
\v 6 The young man said to them, “Do not be astonished! I \add know
that\add* you are looking for Jesus, the man from Nazareth \add town\add*, who was nailed to a cross {whom they nailed to a
cross}. But he has become alive again! He is not here! Look! \add Here
is\add* the place where they placed his \add body\add*. 
\v 7 But, instead \add of remaining here\add*, go and tell his disciples. Particularly
\add be sure\add* that you tell Peter. Tell them, ‘\add Jesus\add* is going ahead of you to Galilee
\add district\add*, and you will see him there, just like he told you
\add previously’!\add*” 
\v 8 The women went outside and ran from the tomb. They were trembling
\add because they were afraid\add*, and they were astonished. But they did not say anything to anyone
\add about this\add* while they were going, because they were afraid.
\s [The end of Mark's Gospel was lost or destroyed long ago. Then someone wrote verses 9-20 from what he remembered about those
events. That ending is given below.] 
\s MARK 16:9-14 
\s Jesus rebuked the disciples for not believing the reports of his being alive again.
\p [
\v 9 When Jesus became alive \add again\add* early on Sunday morning, he appeared first to Mary
\add from\add* Magdala \add town\add*. She was the woman from whom he had
\add previously\add* expelled seven evil spirits. 
\v 10 She went to those who had been with \add Jesus\add*, while they were mourning and crying. She told them
\add what she had seen\add*. 
\v 11 But when she told them that Jesus was alive again and that she had seen him, they refused to believe it.
\v 12 Later \add that day\add*, Jesus appeared to two of \add his
disciples\add* while they were walking \add from Jerusalem to their homes
in\add* the \add surrounding\add* area. \add But they did not recognize him quickly
because\add* he looked very different. 
\v 13  \add After they recognized him\add*, those two went back \add to Jerusalem. They told his other followers what had
happened\add*, but they did not believe it. 
\v 14 Later he appeared to the eleven \add apostles\add* while they were eating. He rebuked them because they had stubbornly
refused to believe\add the reports of\add* those who saw him after he had become alive again.
\s MARK 16:15-20 
\s Miracles began to happen after Jesus instructed his disciples to preach the gospel everywhere and he told them that miracles
would accompany their ministry. 
\p
\v 15  \add Later\add* he said to them, “Go into the whole world and preach the good message to everyone!
\v 16 Everyone who believes \add your message\add* and who is baptized will be saved
{\add God\add* will save}. But everyone who does not believe it will be condemned
{\add God\add* will condemn}. 
\v 17 Those who believe \add my good message\add* will perform miracles. Specifically, by my power they will expel evil
spirits. They will speak in languages that they have not learned.
\v 18 If they pick up snakes \add accidentally\add* or if they drink any poisonous
\add liquid accidentally\add*, they will not be hurt. \add Whenever\add* they put their hands on sick
\add people in order that God will heal them\add*, those sick people will become well.”
\p
\v 19 After the Lord Jesus had said this to \add the disciples, he was
taken\add* {\add God\add* took him} up into heaven. Then he sat down on his throne beside God
\add to rule with him\add*. 
\v 20  \add As for the disciples\add*, they went out \add from Jerusalem, and then they preached everywhere. Wherever they
went\add*, the Lord enabled them to perform miracles. \add By doing
that\add*, he showed people that God's message is true.]
