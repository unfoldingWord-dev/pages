\s MARK 15:1-5 
\s In the governor Pilate's presence Jesus refused to answer accusations against him.
\p
\v 1 Very early in the morning the chief priests met together with
\add the rest of\add* the Jewish council, \add in order to decide how to accuse Jesus before the Roman governor. Their
guards\add* tied Jesus' hands \add again\add*. They took him to \add the house
of\add* Pilate, \add the governor, and they started to accuse him,
saying\add* “\add Jesus is claiming that he is a king!\add*” 
\v 2 Pilate asked Jesus, “Do you \add claim to be\add* the king of the Jews?” Jesus answered him, “You yourself have said so.”
\v 3 Then the chief priests claimed that Jesus had done many bad things.
\v 4 So Pilate asked him again, “Do you have nothing to reply? Listen to how many bad things they are saying that you
\add have done\add*!” 
\v 5 But \add even though Jesus was not guilty\add*, he did not say anything more. The result was that Pilate was very much
surprised. 
\s MARK 15:6-15 
\s At the crowd's insistence, Pilate released a criminal and gave orders that Jesus should be crucified.
\p
\v 6 It was the governor's custom \add each year\add* during the
\add Passover\add* celebration to release \add one person who was in prison. He customarily
released\add* whichever prisoner the people requested. 
\v 7  \add At that time\add* there was a man called Barabbas who had been {whom
\add the soldiers had\add*} \add put in prison with some other men\add*. Those men had
murdered\add some soldiers\add* when they rebelled \add against the Roman
government\add*. 
\v 8 A crowd approached \add Pilate\add* and asked him \add to release
someone\add*, just like he customarily did for them \add during the Passover
celebration\add*. 
\v 9 Pilate answered them, “Would you like me to release for you the
\add man whom you\add* Jewish \add people say is your\add* king?”
\v 10  \add He asked this\add* because he realized what the chief priests were wanting to do. They were accusing Jesus because
they were jealous of him \add because many people were becoming his
disciples\add*. 
\v 11 But the chief priests urged the crowd \add to request\add* that Pilate release Barabbas for them instead
\add of Jesus\add*. 
\v 12 Pilate said to them again, “\add If I release Barabbas\add*, what do you want me to do with the man whom
\add some of\add* you Jews say is \add your\add* king?” 
\v 13 Then they shouted again, “\add Command that your soldiers\add* crucify him!”
\v 14 Then Pilate said to them, “Why? What crime has he committed?” But they shouted even louder,
“\add Command your soldiers to\add* crucify him!” 
\v 15 So, because Pilate wanted to please the crowd, he released Barabbas for them. Then, after
\add his soldiers\add* had whipped Jesus with leather straps into which they had fastened metal pieces,
\add Pilate told the soldiers to take him away\add* in order that he would be crucified {they would crucify him}.
\s MARK 15:16-20 
\s The soldiers ridiculed Jesus as being a king. 
\p
\v 16 The soldiers took Jesus into the \add courtyard of the\add* palace
\add where Pilate lived\add*. That place was the government headquarters. Then they summoned the whole ◄cohort/group of
soldiers► \add who were on duty there\add*. 
\v 17  \add After the soldiers gathered together\add*, they put a purple robe on Jesus. Then they placed on his head a crown
that they made from \add branches of\add* thornbushes. \add They did those things in order to ridicule him by pretending that
he was a king\add*. 
\v 18 Then they greeted him \add like they would greet a king, in order to ridicule
him\add*, saying, “Hooray for the King \add who rules\add* the Jews!”
\v 19 They repeatedly struck his head with a reed and spat on him. By kneeling down, they
\add pretended to honor\add* him. 
\v 20 When they had finished ridiculing him, they pulled off the purple robe. They put his own clothes on him, and then they
led him outside \add of the city\add* in order to nail him to a cross.
\s MARK 15:21-24 
\s After they crucified Jesus the soldiers gambled for his clothing.
\p
\v 21  \add After Jesus carried his cross a short distance\add*, a man named Simon from Cyrene
\add city came along\add*. He was the father of Alexander and Rufus. He was passing by while he was returning
\add home\add* from outside \add the city. The soldiers\add* compelled Simon to carry the cross
\add for Jesus\add*. 
\v 22 They brought them both to a place that they \add call\add* Golgotha. That name means, ‘a place
\add like\add* a skull’. 
\v 23 Then they tried to give Jesus wine that was {that they} mixed with
\add medicine called\add* myrrh. \add They wanted him to drink it so that he would not feel so much pain when they crucified
him\add*. But he did not drink it. 
\v 24  \add Some\add* of the \add soldiers took his clothes\add*. Then they nailed him to a cross. Afterwards, they divided his
clothes among themselves by gambling with \add something like\add* dice. They did this
\add in order to determine\add* which \add piece of clothing\add* each one would get.
\s MARK 15:25-32 
\s People passing by, as well as the Jewish leaders and two criminals crucified with Jesus, insulted him.
\p
\v 25 It was nine o'clock in the morning when they crucified him.
\v 26 They \add attached to the cross above Jesus' head\add* a sign on which it had been written {someone had written} the
reason why \add they were nailing him to the cross\add*. \add But
all\add* that it said was, “The King of the Jews.” 
\v 27-28 They also nailed to crosses two men who were bandits. They nailed one to a cross at the right side
\add of Jesus\add* and one to a cross at the left side \add of Jesus\add*.
\v 29 The people who were passing by insulted him by shaking their heads as
\add if here were an evil man\add*. They said, “Aha! You said that you would destroy the Temple and then you would build it
again within three days. 
\v 30  \add If you could do that, then\add* rescue yourself by coming down from the cross!”
\v 31 The chief priests, along with the men who taught the \add Jewish\add* laws, also
\add wanted to\add* make fun of Jesus. So they said to each other, “He
\add claims to have\add* saved others \add from their sicknesses\add* [IRO] but he cannot save himself!
\v 32 He said, ‘I am the Messiah, I am the King who \add rules the people
of\add* Israel.’ \add If his words are true\add*, he should come down now from the cross! Then we will believe
\add him!\add*” The \add two\add* men who were crucified beside him also insulted him.
\s MARK 15:33-41 
\s As several women who had accompanied Jesus watched, he died, after which the Temple curtain split into two parts and the
Roman officer pronounced that Jesus was the Son of God. 
\p
\v 33 At noon the whole land became dark, \add and it stayed dark\add* until three o'clock in the afternoon.
\v 34 At three o'clock Jesus shouted loudly, “Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?” That means, “My God, my God, why have you deserted
me?” 
\v 35 When some of the people who were standing there heard \add the word ‘Eloi’, misunderstanding
it\add*, they said, “Listen! He is calling for \add the prophet\add* Elijah!”
\v 36 One of them ran and filled a sponge with sour wine. He placed it on
\add the tip of\add* a reed, and then he\add held it\add* up for
\add Jesus\add* to suck out\add the wine that was in\add* it. \add While he was doing that,
someone\add* said, “Wait! Let's see whether Elijah will come to take him down
\add from the cross!\add*” 
\v 37 And then, after Jesus shouted loudly, he stopped breathing
\add and died\add*. 
\v 38  \add At that moment\add* the \add heavy thick\add* curtain that closed off
\add the most holy place in\add* the Temple split into two pieces from top to bottom.
\add That showed that ordinary people could now go into the presence of
God\add*. 
\v 39 The officer who supervised the soldiers \add who nailed Jesus to the
cross\add* was standing in front of Jesus. When he saw how Jesus died, he exclaimed, “Truly, this man was ◄the Son of God/the
man who was also God►!” 
\v 40-41 There were also some women there, watching these events from a distance. They had accompanied Jesus when he was in
Galilee \add district\add*, and they had provided what he needed. They had come with him to Jerusalem. Among those women was
Mary from Magdala \add town\add*. There was \add another\add* Mary, who was the mother of the younger James and of Joses. There
was also Salome. 
\s MARK 15:42-47 
\s Several women watched as Joseph and others buried Jesus' body in a cave after getting permission from Pilate.
\p
\v 42-43 When evening was near, \add a man named\add* Joseph from Arimathea
\add town came there\add*. He was a member of the \add Jewish\add* council, one whom everyone respected. He was also one of
those who had been waiting expectantly for the \add time when\add*
God\add would send\add* his king to begin to rule. \add He knew that, according to Jewish law, people's bodies had to be
buried\add* {\add someone had to bury people's bodies\add*} \add on the day they died. He also realized
that\add* it was the day when \add people\add* prepared \add things
for\add* ◄\add the Jewish day of rest/the Sabbath\add*►, \add and that the Sabbath would start when the sun
set\add*. So he became courageous and went to Pilate and asked Pilate
\add to permit him to take\add* the body of Jesus \add down from the cross and bury it
immediately\add*. 
\v 44 Pilate was surprised \add when he heard that\add* Jesus was already dead. So he summoned the officer who was in charge of
the soldiers \add who crucified Jesus\add*, and he asked him if \add Jesus\add* had already died.
\v 45 When the officer told \add Pilate that Jesus was dead\add*, Pilate allowed Joseph
\add to take away\add* the body. 
\v 46 After Joseph bought a linen cloth, he \add and others\add* took
\add Jesus' body down from the cross\add*. They wrapped it in the linen cloth and laid it in a tomb that
\add previously\add* had been dug out of the rock \add cliff\add*. Then they rolled a
\add huge flat\add* stone in front of the entrance to the tomb. 
\v 47 Mary \add from\add* Magdala \add village\add* and Mary the mother of Joses were watching where Jesus'
\add body\add* was placed {where they placed Jesus' \add body\add*}.
