\s Philippians 3:1 
\s As for the other matters, continue to rejoice and know that it is not tiresome for me and it is safe for you to mention them
again. 
\p
\v 1  \add Now there are\add* other things \add that I want to write
about\add*. My fellow believers, continue to rejoice because \add you belong
to\add* the Lord. \add Though\add* I will \add now\add* write to you about those same matters
\add that I mentioned to you before, this is\add* not tiresome for me, and it will protect you
\add from those who would harm you spiritually\add*. 
\s Philippians 3:2-4a 
\s Beware of those unholy people who will harm you spiritually by insisting that you must be circumcised in order to become
God's people. 
\p
\v 2 Beware of those \add people who are dangerous\add* [MET] \add like
wild\add* dogs. They are \add dangerous\add* evildoers [DOU]. Beware of them
\add since they are like people who\add* cut \add other people's\add* bodies [MET].
\add They will harm you spiritually by insisting that you must let someone circumcise you in order for you to become God's
people\add* [MTY, MET]. 
\v 3  \add Those people think that they are God's people because someone has circumcised
them\add*. But we, \add not they\add*, are \add truly God's people\add* [MET],
\add whether or not someone has\add* circumcised \add us\add*. God's Spirit
\add enables us to\add* [MTY] worship \add God\add*; we praise Christ Jesus
\add because he has enabled us to become the people of God\add*. We do not believe
\add that God will consider/make us his people as a result of what someone has done to
our\add* bodies [MTY, SYN]. 
\v 4  \add We do not trust in those rituals to make us acceptable to
God\add*, although I could very well do that \add if it would be useful for
me\add*. 
\s Philippians 3:4b-6 
\s Since I was circumcised properly and have a purely Hebrew ancestry, and since I kept the Jewish laws blamelessly, I could
rely upon what I have done and who I am better than anyone else could, if it were beneficial for my salvation.
\p \add In fact\add*, \add if I could benefit from it for my salvation\add*, I could rely upon what I have done and who I am
[MTY, SYN] more than anyone else could. I will tell you why. 
\v 5 I \add was circumcised\add* {\add Someone\add* circumcised me} when I was one week old. I am from the people of Israel. I
am from the tribe of Benjamin. I am completely Hebrew in every way.
\add While I was\add* a member of the Pharisee \add sect\add*, I
\add strictly obeyed\add* the laws \add that God gave Moses\add*.
\v 6 I was \add so\add* zealous \add to make people obey those laws
that\add* I caused the people who believe in Christ to suffer \add because I thought they were trying to abolish those laws.
Indeed\add*, as far as my obeying those laws is concerned, no \add one
could\add* have accused \add me by\add* saying that I had disobeyed any of those laws.
\s Philippians 3:7-11 
\s I now consider all these advantages that I once supposed would help me to be worthless, and I consider everything else as
well to be worthless, because I want to know Christ, to be united with him, and to be made righteous through trusting in Christ
alone. 
\p
\v 7 Nevertheless, all such things as those, which I used to \add consider
to\add* be useful to me, those \add very\add* things I now consider worthless, because I
\add want to know\add* Christ (OR, in order that I \add may know\add* Christ).
\v 8 More than that, I consider all things to be worthless, compared to how great it is to know Christ Jesus my Lord. Because I
\add want to know\add* him \add better\add* (OR, In order that I
\add may know\add* him \add better\add*), I have rejected all things as worthless. I consider them
\add as useless as\add* [MET] rubbish, in order that I may have \add a close relationship
with\add* Christ [MET], 
\v 9 and in order that I may completely belong to him. It was not as a result of
\add my obeying\add* the laws \add he gave Moses\add* that God erased the record of my sins. Instead, it is because I have
trusted in Christ \add that God\add* has declared the guilt for my sins to be ended and he enables me to act righteously.
\add It is\add* God \add himself who\add* has erased the record of my sins, and he enables me to act righteously,
\add only\add* because I have trusted \add in Christ\add*. 
\v 10 I \add want\add* to know Christ \add better and better\add*. Particularly, I
\add want\add* to continually experience \add his working\add* powerfully in ◄me/my life►,
\add just like God worked powerfully when he\add* caused Christ to become alive after he died. I
\add also want to be continually willing\add* to suffer \add in order that I may obey
God\add*, just like Christ suffered \add in order that he might obey God. I also
want\add* to be completely willing to die for \add Christ\add*, even as he died for me,
\v 11  \add because I expect that, as a result of God's goodness\add*, he will cause me to live again after I have died.
\s Philippians 3:12-16 
\s Since you desire to be perfected and since you have my example of not considering that I am already perfect, but of
constantly striving to become more and more like Christ, follow my example.
\p
\v 12 I do not claim that I have already become completely like Christ Jesus; that is, I have not already become all that God
intends me to be [DOU]. But I earnestly try to become \add more and more like
Christ\add*, because he chose me \add in order that I might become like
him\add*. 
\v 13 My fellow believers, I certainly do not consider that I have already become completely like Christ. But I
\add am like a runner. A runner does not look backward\add* [MET]. Instead, he leans/stretches forward as he runs straight
toward the goal \add in order that he might win the race and get the prize.
Similarly\add*, I do not think about what I have already done. 
\v 14 Instead, I concentrate only on \add continuing to become more and more like Christ right up to the end of my
life\add* [MET]. As a result, because of my relationship with Christ Jesus, God will call/summon me to receive a reward from
him \add in heaven\add*. 
\v 15 So, all of us who are \add spiritually\add* mature should think/act this
\add same way\add*. If any \add of you\add* do not think this same way regarding what I
\add have written here\add*, God will reveal this to you. 
\v 16 What is important is that we must conduct our lives according to what
\add God has already revealed to\add* us. 
\s Philippians 3:17-21 
\s Imitate me and those who live as I do. Remember that there are many people who are bad examples, as shown by their lustful
behavior, wanting to do what their bodies desire. But as for us, Christ will transform our weak bodies to be like his glorious
heavenly body. 
\p
\v 17 My fellow believers, \add all of\add* you should unitedly imitate me, and observe those people who act as I do,
\add in order that you may imitate them also\add*. 
\v 18  \add Keep in mind that\add* there are many people \add who say that they believe in Christ,
but\add* who act \add in such a way that shows\add* that they are opposed to
\add the teaching about\add* Christ \add dying on\add* the cross [MTY]. I have told you about those people many times
\add before\add*, and now I am sad, even crying, as I tell you \add about them
again\add*. 
\v 19  \add God\add* will severely punish them. The things their bodies desire [MTY] have become
\add like\add* gods to them [MET]. They are proud of the things they should be ashamed of. They think only about what
unbelievers [MTY] think about. 
\v 20  \add But remember\add* that we are citizens of heaven. And we eagerly wait for our Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ,
\add to return\add* from there. 
\v 21 By the power that enables him to put everything under his own control, he will change our weak bodies to become like his
glorious body.
