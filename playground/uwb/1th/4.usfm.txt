\c 4  
\s 1 Thessalonians 4:1-2 
\s Just like we told you previously, we strongly urge you to increasingly behave in a way that will please God.
\p
\v 1-2 Now, my fellow believers, \add I want to write\add* about some other matters. Because we all have a close relationship
with the Lord Jesus, we(exc) strongly urge you \f + \fr doublet \f* to conduct your lives in a way that pleases God. We taught you to do that,
and you know that we did that as a result of what the Lord Jesus
\add told us to say\add*. We know that you are conducting your lives that way, but
\add we strongly urge\add* that you do that even more. 
\s 1 Thessalonians 4:3-8 
\s God wants you, by your behaving in a sexually pure way, to show that you completely belong to him.
\p
\v 3 God wants you to live pure lives that will show that you completely belong to him. He wants you to avoid doing any
sexually immoral acts (OR, avoid being sexually immoral in any way).
\v 4  \add That is, he wants\add* each one of you to know how to control your own sexual desires \f + \fr euphemism \f*. He wants you to live
pure lives that all people will see as good. 
\v 5 You must not lustfully desire \add to do\add* immoral acts as unbelievers \f + \fr metonymy \f*
\add do\add* who do not obey God. 
\v 6  \add God wants each one of you to control your sexual desires, in order
that\add* no one of you sin against your fellow believer and take advantage of him or her by doing things like that. Remember
that we strongly warned you previously \f + \fr doublet \f* that the Lord \add Jesus\add* will punish all
\add people who do\add* sexually immoral acts. 
\v 7 When God chose us \add believers\add*, he did not want us to
\add be people who\add* behave in a sexually immoral way. On the contrary,
\add he wants us\add* to be \add people who\add* behave in a morally pure way.
\v 8 So I warn you that those who disregard \add this teaching\add* of mine
\add are\add* not just disregarding a human being. On the contrary,
\add they are disregarding\add* God, \add because God commanded it. Remember
that\add* God sent his Spirit, who is holy, \add to live\add* in you!
\s 1 Thessalonians 4:9-12 
\s We urge you to increasingly love each other, to strive to work at your own occupations, and not meddle in others' affairs.
\p
\v 9  \add I want to urge you\add* again\add that you should\add* love
\add your\add* fellow believers \f + \fr metaphor \f*. You do not really need that
\add anyone\add* write to you about that, because God has already taught you
\add how\add* to love each other, 
\v 10 and because you already are \add showing that you love\add* your fellow believers \f + \fr hyperbole \f*
\add who live\add* in other places \add in your province\add* of Macedonia. Nevertheless, my fellow believers, we urge you to
increasingly \add love each other\add*. 
\v 11  \add We urge you\add* also to eagerly strive/try to attend to your own affairs and to not meddle/interfere with the
affairs of others. We urge you also to work at your own occupations/jobs
\add to earn what you need to live\add*. Remember that we taught you previously to live like that.
\v 12 If you do these things, unbelievers will acknowledge/see that you behave decently/properly, and you will not have to
depend on others \add to\add* ◄\add supply/give to you\add*► \add what you
need\add*. 
\s 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18 
\s God will cause to live again those believers who died and will bring them to the sky with Jesus. Encourage each other by
telling this message. 
\p
\v 13 My fellow believers, we also want you to understand well \f + \fr litotes \f*
\add what will happen\add* to our fellow believers \add who now\add* are dead \f + \fr euphemism \f*.
\add You must not be/do like\add* the unbelievers. They \add grieve deeply for people who die
because\add* they do not confidently expect \add people to live again after they
die\add*. 
\v 14 We \add believers\add* know that it is true that Jesus died and that he rose
\add to live\add* again. So \add we also know well that\add* God
\add will cause\add* those \add believers\add* who died \f + \fr euphemism \f* \add to live
again\add*. \add We know that he\add* will cause them to go \add to
heaven\add* (OR, come) with Jesus as a result of God's \add commanding them to arise
and\add* ◄\add go to/come with\add*► \add Jesus\add*. 
\v 15  \add I write this\add* because the Lord \add Jesus\add* revealed
\add to me\add* what I am now telling you. \add Some of you may think
that\add* when the Lord \add Jesus\add* comes back, he will consider that we
\add believers\add* who are still living will be superior to those
\add believers\add* who have died \f + \fr euphemism \f*, because \add we will meet Jesus first. That is certainly not
true!\add* 
\v 16 It is the Lord \add Jesus\add* himself who will descend from heaven.
\add When he comes down, he\add* will command all of \add us believers to
rise\add*. The chief angel will shout\add with a loud\add* voice, and
\add another angel\add* will blow a trumpet for God. Then (OR, As a result), the first thing that will happen is that the
people who \add trusted\add* in Christ before they died will live again.
\v 17 After that, \add God\add* will powerfully take up into the clouds all of us
\add believers\add* who are still living \add on this earth\add*.
\add He will take us\add* and those \add other believers who have
died\add*, in order that \add we all\add* might together meet/welcome the Lord
\add Jesus\add* in the sky. As a result of that, we \add all\add* will be with him forever.
\v 18 Because \add all this is true\add*, encourage/comfort each other by ◄sharing this teaching with each other/reminding each
other of this teaching►.
