\c 3  
\s 1 Thessalonians 3:1-5 
\s When I could no longer endure worrying about you, I sent Timothy to you in order to find out whether or not you were still
trusting in God. 
\p
\v 1 As a result of that, when I could no longer endure \add worrying about
you\add*, I decided that \add Silas and I\add* would stay behind alone in Athens
\add city\add*, 
\v 2 and we two sent Timothy \add to you. You know that he is\add* our close associate and also works for God by
\add proclaiming\add* the message about Christ. \add Silas and I sent
him\add* in order that he would urge you to continue to strongly trust
\add in Christ\add*. 
\v 3 We wanted that none \add of you\add* would consider turning away from Christ as a result of
\add people\add* causing you to suffer. You know that \add God has\add* planned that
\add we who trust in him will suffer like that when people do that to us who trust in
him\add*. 
\v 4 Remember that when we were present with you, we kept telling you that we would be persecuted {that
\add people\add* would cause us to suffer}. And because that is what happened, you know that
\add what we said\add* was true! 
\v 5  \add I was\add* afraid that \add Satan\add*, the one who tempts us, had caused you
\add to stop trusting in Christ. If that had happened\add*, we would have worked uselessly
\add while we were present with you! So\add* I sent \add Timothy to
you\add* in order to find out whether or not you were \add still\add* trusting
\add in Christ\add*. I sent him because I could no longer endure
\add not knowing ◄about your spiritual condition\f + \ft Or: whether \f* or not you were still trusting in
Christ\add*►. 
\s 1 Thessalonians 3:6-10 
\s Now Timothy has just returned and has told us the good news that you still trust in Christ. As a result, we have been
cheered up, and we cannot thank God adequately for what he has done for you. Very frequently we ask God that we will be able to
visit you and help you to trust him more strongly. 
\p
\v 6 Now Timothy has just returned to Silas and me from \add being
with\add* you, and he has told us the good news that you \add still\add* trust
\add in Christ\add* and that you love \add him\add* \f + \ft Or: \add each
other\add*). He told us also that you always happily remember us
\add and that\add* you strongly desire that we visit you, just like we strongly desire to visit you.
\v 7 My fellow believers, \add even though\add* we are suffering very much \f + \ft doublet \f* because of what people are doing to us here,
we have been cheered up because \add Timothy told us about\add* your
\add still\add* trusting \add in Christ\add*. 
\v 8 Now we feel very encouraged \f + \ft idiom \f* that you continue to strongly
\add trust\add* in the Lord \add Jesus\add*. 
\v 9 ◄We cannot thank God adequately for \add what he has done for\add* you!\f + \ft Or: How \f* can we thank God enough for
\add what he has done for\add* you?► \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* We greatly rejoice concerning you
\add when we pray to\add* our God! 
\v 10 We constantly \f + \ft hyperbole \f* and fervently\f + \ft Or: earnestly \f* ask \add God\add* that
\add we will be able\add* to visit you \f + \ft synecdoche \f* and that \add we will be
able\add* to help you to trust \add in Christ\f + \ft Or: God \f*\add* more strongly!
\s 1 Thessalonians 3:11-13 
\s We pray that God will help us to return to you and that the Lord Jesus will help you to love each other and other people
more and more, just like we love you more and more. 
\p
\v 11 We pray to God, our Father, and to our Lord Jesus, that they will clear the way\f + \ft Or: make it possible \f* so that we can return
to you. 
\v 12 As for you, we pray that the Lord Jesus will help you to love each other and other people more and more, just like we
continue loving you more and more. 
\v 13 We pray that our Lord Jesus will strengthen your purpose\f + \ft Or: desire \f* to do what pleases God (OR, strengthen you spiritually \f*.
We pray that God our Father will enable you to conduct your lives in a way that is pure and that no one can justly criticize so
that when Jesus comes back to earth accompanied by all those who belong to him, he will be pleased with you.
