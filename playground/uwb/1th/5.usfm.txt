\c 5  
\s 1 Thessalonians 5:1-8 
\s We believers should be prepared for the time when the Lord Jesus returns and not be as unbelievers who will be unprepared.
We must not be like them. On the contrary, we must be vigilant and self-controlled.
\p
\v 1 My fellow believers, \add I want to tell you more\add* about the time or period
\add when the Lord Jesus will come back. Really\add*, you do not need that I write to you about that,
\v 2 because you yourselves know accurately \add about it already! You
know\add* that the Lord \add Jesus will return\add* [MTY] \add unexpectedly\add* (OR,
\add when some people are unprepared\add*). \add People will not expect him, just like no one knows
when\add* a thief \add comes unexpectedly\add* at night [SIM]. 
\v 3  \add At a future time\add* many people will say, “\add All
is\add* peaceful and \add we are\add* safe!” Then suddenly he will come to punish them severely! Just like a pregnant woman who
\add experiences\add* birth pains \add cannot stop those pains\add*, those people will definitely not
\add have any way to\add* escape \add their punishment\add*. 
\v 4-5  \add Just like people\add* in darkness \add are unaware of what is happening around them, most people are not aware of
what is about to happen to them\add* [MET, PRS]. Just like a thief
\add comes unexpectedly for people who are unaware, that time of punishment will come on people when they are not expecting
it\add* [SIM]. But you, my fellow believers, are people who are very much aware [LIT] of what is going to happen. As a result,
you will be expecting [LIT] those things [MTY] to happen [PRS] All of us
\add believers\add* are people [IDM] \add who do what is right, as people usually do when it
is\add* daytime [MET]. We are not \add people who do evil things, as some people do when it
is\add* dark [MET]. 
\v 6 So we believers must be aware of what is happening. We must be watching carefully,
\add as people who are awake are watchful for a thief\add* [MET]. We must be self-controlled, as people who are ◄sober/not
drunk► are able to control what they do [MET]. People who sleep [MET]
\add are unaware of what is happening, and unbelievers are like that\add*.
\v 7 It is at night when people \add are unaware of what is happening because
they\add* are asleep, and it is at night when people become drunk
\add and they do very wrong actions/things\add*. 
\v 8 But we believers are people who \add should do what is right\add* [MET], so we must be self-controlled,
\add as people\add* in the daytime \add are usually not drunk and are able to control what they
do\add* [MET]. \add As Roman soldiers protect themselves by\add* putting on breastplates and helmets [MET], we
\add believers\add* must \add protect ourselves by continuing to\add* trust and love
\add the Lord Jesus\add* and by continuing to confidently expect that he will save
\add us from God's punishing us at the time when he will punish other
people\add*. 
\s 1 Thessalonians 5:9-11 
\s God has destined us believers to be saved from future punishment and to be able to live together with our Lord Jesus after
he returns. Since this is true, encourage each other. 
\p
\v 9 When God chose us, he did not plan for us to \add be people whom he will
severely\add* punish [MTY]. On the contrary, \add he decided\add* that he would save us because of
\add our trusting in what\add* our Lord Jesus Christ \add has done for
us\add*. 
\v 10 Jesus died \add to atone/pay\add* for our \add sins\add* in order that we might be able to live together with him,
whether we are alive [MET] or whether we are dead [EUP] \add when he returns to
earth\add*. 
\v 11 Because \add you know that this is true\add*, continue to encourage/comfort each other, as indeed you now are doing.
\s 1 Thessalonians 5:12-13 
\s Recognize as leaders those people who care for and instruct you; highly esteem and love them. Live peacefully with each
other. 
\p
\v 12 My fellow believers, we \add three\add* ask that you recognize/honor
\add as leaders\add* those people who work hard for you. \add Specifically\add*, respect those who lead you as fellow believers
who ◄have a close relationship with/are united to► the Lord \add Jesus\add*. They warn you
\add to stop doing what is wrong\add* (OR, they teach you \add to do what is
right\add*). 
\v 13 That is, we \add ask that you\add* consider those leaders to be very important and that you love them, because they work
\add hard to help you\add*. We also urge you to live peacefully with each other.
\s 1 Thessalonians 5:14-15 
\s Warn believers who will not work, and encourage and help those who need it. Be patient with all people. Do good deeds to
them all, including those who do evil deeds to you. 
\p
\v 14 My fellow believers, we urge that you warn \add believers\add* who will not work
\add in order to\add* ◄\add obtain/earn the money to buy\add*► \add things that they need to live. Tell them that they are
behaving wrongly\add*. We urge you that you encourage \add believers\add* who are fearful (OR, discouraged), and that you help
all people who are weak \add in any way\add*. We also urge you to be patient with everyone.
\v 15 Make sure that none \add of you\add* does evil deeds to anyone
\add who has done\add* evil to you. On the contrary, you must always try to do good
\add deeds\add* to each other (OR, to fellow believers) and to everyone else.
\s 1 Thessalonians 5:16-18 
\s Always rejoice, pray, and thank God. 
\p
\v 16 Be joyful ◄at all times/always►, 
\v 17 pray continually, 
\v 18 and thank \add God\add* ◄in all \add circumstances/\add*regardless
\add of what happens\add*►. God wants you \add to behave\add* like that
\add because of what\add* Christ Jesus \add has done for you\add* (OR, because you have a close relationship with Christ
Jesus). 
\s 1 Thessalonians 5:19-22 
\s Evaluate all messages that people claim that the Holy Spirit gave them. Accept authentic messages and obey them.
\p
\v 19 Do not \add refuse the urging from God's\add* Spirit \add when he is
working\add* [MTY] \add among you. That would be like\add* throwing water on
\add a fire\add* [MET]! 
\v 20  \add Specifically\add*, do not despise messages that the Holy Spirit reveals to someone
\add and reject them automatically\add*. 
\v 21 On the contrary, evaluate all \add such messages\add*. Accept the
\add messages that are truly from God, and obey them\add*. 
\v 22 Do not obey any kind of evil \add message\add*. 
\s 1 Thessalonians 5:23-24 
\s We pray that God will cause you to be distinct people who behave right in every way, and I am sure that he will do this.
\p
\v 23  \add We pray to\add* God that he will change you to become more and more like his people should be. He is the one who
causes \add his people\add* to have \add inner\add* peace. \add That is, we
pray\add* that he will help you so that in all that you think, in all that you desire, and in all that you do, you will be
without fault. We ask him that he will keep doing that \add until\add* our Lord Jesus Christ comes back
\add to earth\add*. 
\v 24  \add Because God\add* has invited you \add to be his people, you
can\add* certainly trust him to keep on helping you in that way.
\s 1 Thessalonians 5:25-28 
\s Pray for us. Affectionately greet all your fellow believers, and make certain that someone reads this letter aloud to all of
them. May the Lord bless you. 
\p
\v 25 My fellow believers, pray for me and for Silas and for Timothy.
\v 26  \add When you gather together as believers\add*, greet each other affectionately, as fellow believers
\add should\add*. 
\v 27 Make certain that you read this letter to all the believers who may be absent when you read it at
first\add , knowing that\add* the Lord \add Jesus wants you to do
it\add*. 
\v 28  \add I pray that\add* our Lord Jesus Christ \add will continue to
act\add* kindly toward you all.
