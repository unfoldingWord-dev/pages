\c 28  
\s Matthew 28:1-10 
\s After an angel appeared to several women and showed them the tomb was empty, Jesus appeared to them.
\p
\v 1 After ◄the Sabbath/the Jewish day of rest► \add ended\add*, on Sunday morning at dawn, Mary from Magdala
\add town\add* and the other Mary went to look at the tomb. 
\v 2 Suddenly there was a strong earthquake. \add At the same time\add* an angel from God came down from heaven. He
\add went to the tomb and\add* rolled the stone away \add from the entrance so that everyone could see that the tomb was
empty\add*. Then he sat on the stone. 
\v 3 His appearance was \add as bright\add* \f + \fr simile \f* as lightning, and his clothes were as white as snow.
\v 4 The guards shook because they were very afraid. Then they became
\add completely motionless\add*, as though they were dead. 
\p
\v 5 The angel said to the two women, “You should not be afraid! I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was {whom they}
◄nailed to a cross/crucified►. 
\v 6 He is not here! \add God\add* has ◄caused him to be alive again/raised him
\add from the dead\add*►, just like \add Jesus\add* told you \add would
happen!\add* Come and see the place where his body lay! 
\v 7 Then go quickly and tell his disciples, ‘He has risen from the dead! He will go ahead of you to Galilee
\add district\add*. You will see him there.’ \add Pay attention to
what\add* I have told you!” 
\p
\v 8 So the women left the tomb quickly. They were afraid, but they were
\add also\add* very joyful. They ran to tell us disciples \add what had
happened\add*. 
\v 9 Suddenly, \add as they were running\add*, Jesus appeared to them. He said, “Greetings!” The women came close to him. They
knelt down and clasped his feet and worshipped him. 
\v 10 Then Jesus said to them, “Do not be afraid! Go and tell ◄all my disciples/all those who have been accompanying me► that
they should go to Galilee. They will see me there.” 
\s Matthew 28:11-15 
\s What the guards were told to tell people about why Jesus' body was gone.
\p
\v 11 While the women were going, some of the soldiers who had been guarding
\add the tomb\add* went into the city. They reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.
\v 12 So the chief priests and Jewish elders met together. They made a plan
\add to explain why the tomb was empty\add*. They gave the soldiers a lot of money
\add as a bribe\add*. 
\v 13 They said, “Tell people, ‘His disciples came during the night and stole his
\add body\add* while we were sleeping.’ 
\v 14 If the governor hears \f + \fr metonymy \f* about this, we ourselves will make sure that he does not get angry
\add and punish you\add*. \add So you will not have to worry\add*.”
\v 15 So the soldiers took the money and did as they were told {as
\add the chief priests and elders\add* told them}. And this story has been told {People have told this story} among the Jews to
the very day \add that I am writing\add* this. 
\s Matthew 28:16-20 
\s Jesus appeared to the apostles in Galilee and gave them final instructions.
\p
\v 16  \add Later we\add* eleven \add disciples\add* went to Galilee
\add district\add*. We went to the mountain where Jesus had told\add us\add* to go.
\v 17 We saw him \add there\add* and worshipped him. But some of\add us\add* doubted
\add that it was really Jesus, and that he had become alive again\add*.
\v 18 Then Jesus came \add close\add* to \add us\add* and said, “\add My
Father\add* has given me all authority over everything and everyone in heaven and on earth.
\v 19 So go, and \add using my authority, teach my message to\add* people of all ethnic groups so that they may become my
disciples. Baptize them \add to be under the authority of\add* \f + \fr metonymy \f* my Father, and of me, his Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
\v 20 Teach them to obey everything that I have commanded you. And remember that I will be with you always, until the end of
\add this\add* age.”
