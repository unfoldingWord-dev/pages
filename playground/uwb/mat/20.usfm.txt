\c 20  
\s Matthew 20:1-16 
\s Jesus told a parable to illustrate how God will reward those who serve him.
\p
\v 1 “\add In order to illustrate how God rewards people\add*, I will compare
\add the way\add* God [MTY/EUP] rules his people with what the owner of an estate
\add did\add*. Early in the morning the ruler of the estate went to where
\add people who wanted work gathered\add*. He went there to hire laborers to work in his vineyard.
\v 2 He promised the men whom he hired that he would pay them the standard wage
\add for working\add* one day. Then he sent them to his vineyards.
\v 3 At nine o'clock \add that same morning\add* he went back \add to the
market\add*. There he saw more men who did not have work. 
\v 4 He said to them, ‘Go to my vineyard as other men have done,
\add and work there\add*. I will pay you whatever is a just \add wage\add*.’
\add So they also went to his vineyard and began to work\add*. 
\v 5 At noon and at three o'clock he again went \add to the market\add* and found
\add other laborers whom he promised to pay a fair wage\add*. 
\v 6 At five o'clock he went \add to the market again\add* and saw other
\add men\add* standing \add there who were not working\add*. He said to them, ‘Why are you standing here all day and not
working?’ 
\v 7 They said to him, ‘Because no one has hired us.’ He said to them,
‘\add I will hire you\add*. Go to my vineyard as other men have done,
\add and work there.’ So they went\add*. 
\p
\v 8 When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his manager, ‘Tell the men to come so that you can give them their
wages. First, pay the men who started working last, and pay the men last who started working first.’
\v 9 The \add manager\add* paid that standard wage to each of the men who did not start working until five o'clock
\add in the afternoon\add*. 
\v 10 When the men who had begun working early \add in the morning\add* went
\add to get their wages\add*, they thought that they would receive more than the standard wage. But they also received only the
standard wage. 
\v 11 So they complained to the owner of the vineyard \add because they thought their payment was
unfair\add*. 
\v 12 They said \add to him\add*, ‘\add You are not being fair!\add* The men who started working after
\add all of the rest of us started\add* worked for \add only\add* one hour! You
have\add paid\add* them the same \add wage\add* as \add you paid\add* us! But we worked
hard\add all\add* day \f + \fr idiom \f*, \add including working in the\add* hottest part of the day!’
\v 13 The owner of the vineyard said to one of those \add who complained\add*, ‘Friend, I did not treat you unfairly. You
agreed with me \add to work the whole day\add* for the standard wage \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*.
\v 14  \add Stop complaining to me\add*! Take your wage and go! I desire to give the same wage that I gave you to the men who
began working after all of you \add had begun working\add*. 
\v 15 I certainly have a right to \add spend my money\add* as I desire \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*,
\add including paying those laborers what I desire to pay them\add*. ◄You should not be envious about my being generous!/Are
you angry \f + \fr metaphor \f* because I am generous?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*’” 
\v 16  \add Then Jesus said to us\add*, “Similarly, \add God will
reward\add* well \add some\add* people who \add seem to be\add* less important now, and he will not reward
\add some\add* people who \add seem to be\add* more important \add now\add*.”
\s Matthew 20:17-19 
\s For the third time Jesus predicted his death and resurrection.
\p
\v 17 When Jesus was walking \add on the road\add* up to Jerusalem,
\add along with us\add* twelve \add disciples\add*, he took us to a place by ourselves
\add in order that he could talk to us privately\add*. Then he said to us,
\v 18 “Listen carefully! We are \add now\add* going up to Jerusalem.
\add While we are there, someone\add* will enable the chief priests and the men who teach the
\add Jewish\add* laws to seize \add me\add*, the one who came from heaven,
\add and they will put me on trial\add*. They will condemn me \add and
say\add* that I should be killed {the authorities should kill me}.
\v 19  \add Then they\add* will put me in the hands of non-Jews so that they can make fun of me, whip me,
\add and kill me by\add* nailing me to a cross. But on the third day
\add after that\add*, \add God\add* will cause me to live again.”
\s Matthew 20:20-28 
\s Jesus taught that greatness in God's sight means humbly serving others as Jesus did.
\p
\v 20 Then the mother of James and John brought her two sons to Jesus. She bowed down before Jesus and asked him to do her a
favor. 
\v 21 Jesus said to her, “What do you want \add me to do for you\add*?” She said to him, “Permit these two sons of mine to sit
next to you \f + \fr (OR, Permit these two sons of mine to sit next to you at your right side and at your left side) \f*
\add and rule with you\add* \f + \fr metonymy \f* when you become king.” 
\v 22 Jesus said to \add her and her sons\add*, “You do not understand what you are asking for. Can you suffer like I am about
to suffer \f + \fr idiom \f*?” \add James and John\add* answered him, “Yes, we are able
\add to do that\add*.” 
\v 23 Then Jesus said to them, “Yes, you will suffer as I will suffer \f + \fr idiom \f*. But I am not the one who chooses the ones who
\add will\add* sit next to me \add and rule with me\add*. \add God\add*, my Father, will give those places \f + \fr metonymy \f* to the ones
whom he appoints.” 
\p
\v 24 When we ten \add other disciples\add* heard \add what James and John had
requested\add*, we became angry with them \add because we also wanted to rule with Jesus in the highest
positions\add*. 
\v 25  \add So\add* Jesus called all of us together and said \add to
us\add*, “You know that those who rule the non-Jews \add enjoy\add* showing them that they are powerful. Their chief rulers
\add enjoy\add* commanding the people under them. 
\v 26 You \add should\add* not be like them. On the contrary, everyone among you who wants
\add God to consider\add* him great must become\add like\add* a servant for
\add the rest of\add* you. 
\v 27 And everyone among you who wants \add God to consider him\add* to be the most important must
become\add like\add* a slave for \add the rest of\add* you. 
\v 28  \add You should imitate me\add*. \add Even though I am\add* the one who came from heaven, I did not come to be served
{in order that people would serve me}. On the contrary, I \add came in
order\add* to serve \add others\add* and to \f + \fr idiom \f* allow myself to be killed {other people to kill me}, so
that\add my dying would be like\add* a payment to rescue many \add people from being punished for their
sins\add*.” \f + \fr metonymy \f* 
\s Matthew 20:29-34 
\s Jesus healed two blind men. 
\p
\v 29 As we were leaving Jericho \add city\add*, a large crowd of people followed
\add us\add*. 
\v 30  \add As we walked along, we saw\add* two blind men sitting alongside the road. When they heard that Jesus was passing
by, they yelled \add to him\add*, “Lord, Descendant of \add King\add* David,
\add you are the Messiah\add*! Take pity on us!” 
\v 31  \add People in\add* the crowd scolded them \add and\add* told them to be quiet. But the blind men yelled even louder,
“Lord, Descendant of \add King\add* David, \add you are the Messiah\add*! Have pity on us!”
\v 32 Jesus stopped and called them \add to come to him\add*. \add Then\add* he said
\add to them\add*, “What do you want me to do for you?” 
\v 33 They said to him, “Lord, heal our eyes \f + \fr idiom \f* \add so that we can
see!\add*” 
\v 34 Jesus \add felt\add* sorry \add for them and\add* touched their eyes. Immediately they were able to see, and they went
with Jesus.
