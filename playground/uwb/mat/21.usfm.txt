\c 21  
\s Matthew 21:1-11 
\s Jesus entered Jerusalem humbly on a donkey, but with great acclaim by the crowd.
\p
\v 1-2 As \add we\add* approached Jerusalem, we came near Bethphage
\add village\add*, near Olive \add Tree\add* Hill. Jesus said to two
\add of his\add* disciples, "Go to the village just ahead of you. As soon as you enter
\add it\add*, you will see a donkey and her foal that are {someone has} tied
\add up\add*. Untie them and bring them \add here\add* to me. 
\v 3 If anyone says anything to you \add about your doing that\add*, tell
\add him\add*, 'The Lord needs them.' He will \add then allow you
to\add* lead them away." 
\v 4-5 When all this happened, what was written by a prophet {what a prophet wrote about} was fulfilled {happened}. The prophet
wrote, "Tell the people who live in Jerusalem \f + \ft synecdoche \f*, 'Look! Your king is coming to you! He will come humbly. He
\add will show that he is humble, because he will be\add* riding on a colt, the offspring of a donkey.'"
\p
\v 6 So the \add two\add* disciples went and did what Jesus told them to do.
\v 7 They brought the donkey and its colt \add to Jesus\add*. They placed their cloaks on them
\add to make something for him to sit on\add*. Then Jesus \add mounted the
colt\add* and sat on the cloaks. 
\v 8 Then a large crowd spread\add some of\add* their clothing on the road, and other
\add people\add* cut off branches from \add palm\add* trees and spread them on the road.
\add They did those things to decorate the road in order to honor
Jesus\add*. 
\v 9 The crowds that walked in front of him and those who walked behind him were shouting things like, "Praise the
\add Messiah\add*, the descendant of \add King\add* David!" "May the Lord
\add God\add* bless \add this one\add* who comes as \add God's\add* representative and with
\add God's\add* authority \f + \ft metonymy \f*." "Praise God, who is in the highest\add heaven\add*!"
\v 10 As Jesus entered Jerusalem, a crowd of people \f + \ft metonymy \f* from all
\add over the city\add* became excited and were saying, "Why \add are they
honoring\add* this man \add like that\add*?" 
\v 11 The crowd \add that was already following him\add* said, "This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee!"
\s Matthew 21:12-17 
\s Jesus chased buyers and sellers from the temple, and he rebuked the Jewish leaders for objecting to children praising him.
\p
\v 12 Then Jesus went into the Temple \add courtyard\add* and chased out all of those who were buying and selling things there.
He also overturned the tables of those who were giving \add Temple tax money in exchange for
Roman\add* coins, and he overturned the seats of those who were selling pigeons
\add for sacrifices\add*. 
\v 13 Then he said to them, "It is {\add Jeremiah\f + \ft Or: A prophet\add* \f* has} written
\add in the Scriptures that God said\add*, '\add I want\add* my house to be called a place
where\add people\add* pray', but you bandits have made it \f + \ft metaphor \f* your hideout!"
\p
\v 14 After that, \add many\add* blind \add people\add* and lame
\add people\add* came to Jesus in the temple \add in order that he would heal
them\add*, and he healed them. 
\v 15 The high priests and the men who taught the people the \add Jewish\add* laws saw the wonderful deeds that Jesus did.
\add They also saw and\add* heard the children shouting in the Temple, "We praise the
\add Messiah\add*, the descendant of \add King\add* David!" They were indignant
\add because they did not believe that Jesus was the Messiah\add*.
\v 16  \add They thought that Jesus should not be allowing the children to say
that\add*, so they asked him, "\add How can you tolerate\add* this \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*? Do you hear what these
\add children\add* are shouting?" Then Jesus said to them, "Yes, I
\add hear them, but\add* if you \add remembered what\add* you have read
\add in the Scriptures about children praising me, you would know that God is
pleased\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add with them\add*. \add The psalmist\add* wrote,
\add saying to God\add*, 'You have taught infants and other children to praise you perfectly.'"
\p
\v 17 Then Jesus left the city. We \add disciples\add* went \add with
him\add* to Bethany \add town\add*, and we slept there \add that
night\add*. 
\s Matthew 21:18-22 
\s Jesus taught the disciples a lesson from what happened to a fig tree.
\p
\v 18 Early \add the next morning\add* when we were returning to the city,
\add Jesus\add* was hungry. 
\v 19 He saw a fig tree near the road. \add So he went over to it to pick some figs to
eat\add*. But when he got close, he saw that there were no \add figs on the
tree\add*. There were only leaves on it. So \add to illustrate how God would punish the nation of
Israel\add*, he said to the fig tree, "May you never again produce figs!" As a result, the fig tree withered that night.
\v 20  \add The next day\add* when we disciples saw \add what had happened to the
tree\add*, we marveled, and we said \add to Jesus\add*, "It is astonishing that the fig tree withered so quickly!\f + \ft Or: How is it
that the fig tree dried up so quickly? \f*" \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* 
\v 21 Jesus said to us, "Think about this: If you believe \add that God has power to do what you ask him
to\add* and you do not doubt \add that\add*, you will be able to do
\add things like what I have\add* done to this fig tree. You will even be able to do
\add marvelous deeds like\add* saying to a nearby hill, 'Uproot yourself and throw yourself into the sea', and it will happen!
\v 22 In addition \add to that\add*, whenever you ask \add God for
something\add* when you pray \add to him, if you\add* believe \add that he will give it to
you\add*, you will receive\add it from him\add*." 
\s Matthew 21:23-27 
\s Jesus refused to state the basis for his authority because the Jewish leaders refused to admit where John the Baptizer's
authority came from. 
\p
\v 23 After that, Jesus went into the Temple \add courtyard\add*. While he was teaching
\add the people\add*, the chief priests and the elders of the Jewish Council approached him. They asked, "By what authority are
you doing these things? Who authorized you to do what you did \add here
yesterday\add* \f + \ft doublet \f*?" 
\v 24 Jesus said to them, "I also will ask you a question, and if you answer me, I will tell you who authorized me to do these
things. 
\v 25 Where did John \add the Baptizer\add* get \add his authority
to\add* baptize \add those who came to him\add*? \add Did he get
it\add* from God or from people? [MTY\f + \ft Or: EUP \f*]" The chief priests and elders debated among themselves
\add about what they should answer\add*. \add They said to each other\add*, "If we say,
'\add It was\add* [MTY\f + \ft Or: EUP \f*] from God', he will say to us, 'Then you should have believed his
\add message\add*!\f + \ft Or: why did you not believe \add John's message\add*? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*'
\v 26 If we say, 'It was from people', we are afraid that the crowd
\add will react violently\add*, because all \add the people\add* believe that John was a prophet
\add sent by God\add*." 
\v 27 So they answered Jesus, "We do not know \add where John got his
authority\add*." Then he said to them, "\add Because you did not answer my
question\add*, I will not tell you who authorized me to do the things I did
\add here yesterday\add*." 
\s Matthew 21:28-32 
\s Jesus rebuked the religious leaders and said that it is more likely that God would accept notorious sinners than that he
would accept them. 
\p
\v 28  \add Then Jesus said to the chief priests and elders\add*, "Tell me \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* what you think
\add about what I am about to tell you\add*. There was a man who had two sons. He went to his older son and said, 'My son, go
and work in my vineyard today!' 
\v 29 But the son said \add to his father\add*, 'I do not want to
\add go and work in the vineyard today\add*!' But later he changed his mind, and he went to the vineyard
\add and worked\add*. 
\v 30 Then the father approached his younger son and said what he had said to his older son. That son said, 'Sir, I will
\add go and work in the vineyard today.'\add* But he did not go there.
\v 31 So which of the man's two sons did what their father desired?" They answered, "The older son." Jesus
\add explained to them what that parable meant\add* by saying, "Think about this:
\add It is more likely that other people, including\add* tax collectors and prostitutes,
\add whom you think are very sinful\add*, will enter where God rules, than it is that you
\add Jewish leaders\add* will enter. 
\v 32 I \add say this to you\add* because, even though John\add the
Baptizer\add* explained to you how to live righteously, you did not believe his message. But tax collectors and prostitutes
believed his \add message, and they turned away from their sinful
behavior\add*. In contrast, you, even though you saw what they did, refused to turn away from your sinful behavior, and you did
not believe \add John's message\add*." 
\s Matthew 21:33-46 
\s Jesus told a parable about the Jewish religious leaders rejecting him as Messiah.
\p
\v 33 "Listen to another parable \add that I will tell you\add*. There was a landowner who planted a vineyard. He built a fence
around it. He dug a hole in the ground \add inside the fence\add*. He placed
\add in the hole\add* a stone tank to \add collect the juice that would
be\add* pressed out of the grapes. He also built a tower \add inside that fence that someone would sit in to guard that
vineyard\add*. He arranged for some men\add to care for\add* the vineyard
\add and to give him some of the grapes in return\add*. Then he went away to another country.
\v 34 When it was time to harvest the grapes, the landowner sent some of his servants to the men who were caring for the
vineyard to get his share of the grapes \add that the vineyard had
produced\add*. 
\v 35 But the renters seized the servants. They beat one of them, they killed another one, and
\add killed\add* another one of them \add by throwing\add* stones at him.
\v 36  \add So the landowner\add* sent more servants than \add he had
sent\add* the first \add time\add*. The renters treated those servants the same way that
\add they had treated the other servants\add*. 
\v 37 Later, \add knowing this\add*, \add the landowner\add* sent his son to
\add the renters to get his share of the grapes\add*. When he sent him, he said
\add to himself\add*, 'They will certainly respect my son \add and give him some of the
grapes\add*.' 
\v 38 But when the renters saw his son \add arriving\add*, they said to each other, 'This is the man who will inherit
\add this vineyard!\add* Let's join together and kill him and divide the property
\add among ourselves\add*.' 
\v 39 So they grabbed him, dragged him outside the vineyard, and killed him.
\v 40  \add Now I ask you\add*, when the landowner returns to his vineyard, what
\add do you think\add* he will do to those renters?" 
\v 41  \add The chief priests and elders\add* replied, "He will thoroughly destroy those wicked
\add renters\add*! Then he will rent the vineyard to others. They will give him
\add his share of\add* the grapes when they are ripe." 
\v 42 Jesus said to them, "\add That is right, so you need to think carefully about these words
which\add* you have read \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* in the Scriptures: 
\q The builders rejected a certain stone\add . But others put\add* that same stone
\add in its proper place, and it\add* has become the most important
stone\add of the\add* building \f + \ft metaphor \f*. The Lord has done this, and we marvel as we look at it.
\p
\v 43 So, \add because you reject me\add*, I am going to tell you this: God will no longer let you
\add Jews\add* be the people over whom he rules. Instead, he will
let\add non-Jews\add* be the people over whom he rules, and they will do \f + \ft idiom \f* what he asks them to do.
\v 44  \add The important stone in the building represents me, the Messiah, and those who reject me are like people who fall on
this stone\add*. Anyone who falls on this stone will be broken into pieces {This cornerstone will break into pieces anyone who
falls on it}, and it will crush anyone on whom it falls." 
\p
\v 45 When the chief priests and the \add elders who were\add* Pharisees heard this parable, they realized that he was accusing
them \add because they did not believe that he was the Messiah\add*.
\v 46 They wanted to seize him, but \add they did not do so\add* because they were afraid of what the crowds
\add would do if they did that\add*, because \add the crowds\add* considered that Jesus was a prophet.
