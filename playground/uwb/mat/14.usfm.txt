\c 14  
\s Matthew 14:1-13 
\s Herod had John the Baptizer imprisoned and then killed because John criticized Herod for marrying his brother's wife.
\p
\v 1 During that time Herod \add Antipas\add*, the ruler, heard reports about Jesus
\add performing miracles\add*. 
\v 2 He said to his servants: “That must be John the Baptizer. He must have risen from the dead, and that is why he has power
to perform miracles.” 
\v 3-4 The reason \add Herod thought that was this: Herod had married\add* Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip,
\add while Philip was still living. So\add* John had been saying to him,
“\add What\add* you \add did by\add* marrying \add your brother's wife while your brother is still alive is against
God's\add* law!” Then, to \add please\add* Herodias, Herod \add told his
soldiers\add* to arrest John. They bound him with chains and put him in prison.
\v 5 Herod wanted to have John executed, but he was afraid that the people
\add who had accepted what John taught would riot if he did that\add*, because they believed that John was a prophet.
\p
\v 6 But when Herod \add gave a party to celebrate\add* his birthday, the daughter of Herodias danced for
\add his guests\add*. This pleased Herod. 
\v 7 So he promised to give her whatever she asked, and he asked God to punish him if he did not do what he had promised.
\v 8  \add So Herodias' daughter went and asked her mother what to ask
for\add*. Her mother told her to ask for John the Baptizer's head.
\add So\add* her daughter \add went back and\add* said \add to Herod\add*:
“\add Cut off\add* the head of John the Baptizer and \add please\add* bring it here on a platter
\add so that my mother can know for sure that he is dead!\add*” 
\v 9 The king was distressed because he now knew he should not have made that promise to
her\add . But\add* because he had made an oath \add in front of\add* his
guests\add when he made that promise\add*, and \add he did not want\add* them
\add to think that he would not do what he had promised\add*, he commanded that
\add the girl\add* be given \add what she requested\add*. 
\v 10 He sent \add the executioner to go to\add* the prison and to cut off John's head.
\v 11  \add The executioner did that, and\add* put John's head on a platter and gave it to the girl. Then the girl took it to
her mother. 
\v 12 John's disciples then went \add to the prison\add*, took John's body and buried it, and they reported to Jesus
\add what had happened\add*. 
\v 13 After Jesus heard that, he took \add just us disciples\add* with him and we went by boat
\add on Galilee lake to an uninhabited place\add*. 
\s Matthew 14:13-21 
\s Jesus miraculously fed more than 5000 people. 
\p After the crowds heard \add that we had gone to an uninhabited
place\add*, they \add left their towns and\add* followed him, walking along the shore.
\v 14 When Jesus came \add to the shore\add*, he saw a large crowd of people
\add who had gathered there, waiting for him\add*. He felt sorry for them, and he healed those
\add among them who were\add* sick. 
\p
\v 15 When it was \add nearly\add* evening, we disciples came to him and said, “This is a place where nobody lives, and it is
very late. Dismiss the crowds so that they can go into the \add nearby\add*
towns\add . Have them do that so that they can\add* buy food for themselves.”
\v 16 But Jesus said to us, “They do not need to leave \add to get food.
Instead\add*, you \add yourselves\add* give them something to eat!”
\v 17 We said to him, “But we have only five loaves of bread and two
\add cooked\add* fish here!” 
\v 18 He said \add to us\add*, “Bring them to me!” 
\v 19 He told the people \add who had gathered there\add* to sit on the grass. Then he took the five flat loaves and the two
fish. He looked up toward heaven, thanked \add God for them\add*, and broke
\add them into pieces\add*. Then he gave them to us disciples, and we distributed them to the crowd.
\v 20 All \add the people in the crowd\add* ate until they had enough to eat. Then we
\add disciples\add* gathered the pieces that were left over, \add and
we\add* filled twelve baskets with them. 
\v 21 Those who ate were about five thousand men. \add We did\add* not
\add count the\add* women and children! 
\s Matthew 14:22-33 
\s Jesus walked on Galilee lake, and then Peter tried to do the same.
\p
\v 22 Right after that happened, Jesus told us disciples to get in the boat and to go ahead of him further around
\add the lake\add* while he dismissed the crowds. 
\v 23 After he dismissed them, he went up into the hills to pray by himself. When it was evening, he was
\add still\add* there alone. 
\v 24  \add By this time\add* we were already many hundred meters from the shore. The boat was being severely tossed by the
waves {The waves were severely tossing the boat} because the wind was
\add blowing\add* against \add it\add*. 
\v 25  \add Then Jesus came down from the hills to the lake\add*. Some time between three and six o'clock in the morning he
walked on the water toward our \add boat\add*. 
\v 26 When we disciples saw him walking on the water, we thought that he must be a ghost. We were terrified, and we screamed
out because we were afraid. 
\v 27 Immediately Jesus said to us, “Cheer up! It is I. Do not be afraid!”
\v 28 Peter said to him, “Lord, if it is you, tell me to walk on the water to you!”
\v 29 Jesus said, “Come!” So Peter got out of the boat. He walked on the water toward Jesus.
\v 30 But when Peter saw the \add tossing waves which\add* the strong wind
\add caused\add*, he became afraid. He began to sink, and cried out, “Lord, save me!”
\v 31 Immediately Jesus stretched out his hand and grabbed him. He said to Peter, “You only trust a little bit
\add in my power\add*! ◄Why did you doubt \add that I could keep you from
sinking\add*?/You should not have doubted \add that I could keep you from
sinking\add*!► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*” 
\v 32 Then Jesus and Peter got in the boat, and the wind \add immediately\add* stopped blowing.
\v 33 All \add of us disciples\add* who were in the boat worshipped Jesus and said, “Truly you are the Son of God!”
\s Matthew 14:34-36 
\s Jesus healed many sick people in the Gennesaret region. 
\p
\v 34 When we had gone further around\add the lake in the boat\add*, we came to the shore at Gennesaret
\add town\add*. 
\v 35 The men of that area recognized Jesus. So they sent \add people to inform those who
lived\add* in that whole surrounding region \f + \fr metonymy \f* \add that Jesus was in their
area\add*. \add So the people\add* brought to Jesus all the sick people
\add who lived in that region\add*. 
\v 36  \add The sick people\add* kept begging him to allow them to touch
\add him or\add* just to touch the edge of his robe \add so that they would be
healed\add*. And all who touched \add him or his robe\add* were healed {he healed all who touched
\add him or his clothing\add*}.
