\s Matthew 7:1-5 
\s Jesus taught that we should not condemn others for their faults since we have faults ourselves.
\p
\v 1 “Do not talk about how sinfully others have acted, in order that God will not say how sinfully you have acted.
\v 2 If you condemn \add other people\add*, \add God\add* will condemn you. To the same extent that you condemn others, you
will be condemned {\add God\add* will condemn you}. 
\v 3 ◄None of you should be concerned \add about someone else's small
faults\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*!\f + \ft Or: Why \f* should any of you be concerned \add about someone else's small
faults\add*?► [MET, RHQ] \add That would be like noticing\add* a speck in that person's eye. But you should
\add be concerned about your own big faults. They are like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* planks in your own eye, which you do not notice.
\v 4 ◄You should not say to other people \add about their minor faults\add*, ‘Let me remove the specks from your eyes!’\f + \ft Or: Why \f* do
you say to other people \add about their minor faults\add*, ‘Let me remove the specks from your eyes?’► \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\add You should not say that\add* if a plank is still in your own eye \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\v 5 You hypocrite, \add stop committing your own sins! That will be
like\add* removing the plank from your own eye \f + \ft metaphor \f*. Then, as a result, you will be able to perceive things spiritually so
that you can help other people get rid of the \add faults\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*
\add that are like\add* specks in their eyes.” 
\s Matthew 7:6 
\s Jesus taught that we should not teach spiritual truth to those who will not appreciate it.
\p
\v 6 “You do not give holy things to dogs \add that would ignore those
things\add* and attack you \f + \ft chiasmus \f*. You do not throw pearls in front of hogs,
\add because they would just ignore them\add* and trample them. \add Similarly\add*, do not give
\add precious spiritual truth to people you know will not value it but instead will do evil things to
you\add*.” 
\s Matthew 7:7-11 
\s Jesus taught that God is ready to give good things to us if we persist in prayer.
\p
\v 7 “Keep asking \add God for what you need\add*. If you do that,
\add he\add* will give it to you. Confidently keep \add expecting God to give you the things that you need, and he will give
them to you. It will be like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* looking for what you need and finding it. Keep on
\add praying persistently to God. Then God will answer you. It will be
like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* knocking \add on a door in order to enter a room\add*. And the way will be opened
{\add God\add* will open the way} for you \add to get what you pray
for\add*. 
\v 8 Remember that \add God\add* will give things to everyone who continues to ask
\add him for them\add*. \add He\add* will give things to whoever confidently keeps
asking\add . He\add* will open \add the way\add* for people \add to get the things that they keep persistently praying
for\add*. 
\p
\v 9 ◄No man among you would give a stone to his son if his son were to ask for bread.\f + \ft Or: Would \f* anyone among you give a stone to
his son if his son were to ask for bread?► \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* 
\v 10 Likewise, ◄no man would give a \add poisonous\add* snake to his son if his son would ask for a fish.\f + \ft Or: would \f* anyone give a
\add poisonous\add* snake to his son if his son would ask for a fish?► \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 11 You, who are evil, know how to give good things to your children. So
\add God\add*, your Father who is in heaven, will certainly give good things to the people who ask him.”
\s Matthew 7:12 
\s Jesus taught that we should treat others as we would like them to treat us.
\p
\v 12 “So in whatever way you want others to act toward you\add (pl)\add*, that is the way
you\add (pl)\add* should act toward them, because that \add sums up what Moses wrote
in\add* the laws \add that God gave him\add* and \add also what\add* the prophets
\add wrote long ago\add*.” 
\s Matthew 7:13-14 
\s Jesus taught that we should try to walk on the narrow road that leads to heaven.
\p
\v 13-14 “\add Going to\add* where people live eternally \add with God in
heaven\add* is difficult. \add It is like\add* going along a narrow road [PRS, MET] that leads to a narrow gate. Not many
people find that way. \add The way\add* that most \add people take\add* is easy,
\add but it results in their being punished\add* {\add God punishing
them\add*} \add in hell. That way is like a\add* wide road that people walk on [PRS, MET] until they reach the wide gate, but
that road and that gate lead to where \add they\add* will be destroyed
{\add God\add* will destroy them}. Many people enter that gate. So I
\add am telling you to leave the wide road and\add* enter the narrow gate
\add to heaven\add*.” 
\s Matthew 7:15-20 
\s Jesus taught about how to recognize false prophets. 
\p
\v 15 “Beware of people who come to you and say falsely that they are telling you
\add what God has said\add*. \add They seem to be harmless, but they are extremely harmful. They are
like\add* wolves that have covered themselves with sheepskins \add to make people believe that they are
sheep\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, but they actually are wolves that attack people \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\v 16  \add So how will you know that they are false?\add* Well, by seeing what plants produce, you know
\add what kind of plants\add* they are \f + \ft metaphor \f*. \add For example, thornbushes cannot produce
grapes\add*, so no one can pick grapes from thornbushes.\f + \ft Or: can anyone pick grapes from thornbushes? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* And
\add thistles cannot produce figs\add*, so no one can pick figs from thistles.\f + \ft Or: can anyone pick figs from thistles? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 17  \add Here is another example\add*: All good fruit trees produce good fruit, but all rotten trees produce worthless
fruit. 
\v 18 No good fruit tree is able to produce worthless fruit, and no rotten tree is able to produce good fruit.
\v 19  \add And\add* all the trees that do not produce good fruit are chopped down and burned in the fire {people chop them
down and burn them in the fire} \add to get rid of them\add*. \add Similarly\add*, those who falsely claim to be
prophets\add will be thrown\add* {\add God will throw false prophets\add*}
\add into the fires of hell\add*. 
\v 20 By seeing \add what plants\add* produce, you know \add what kind of
plants\add* they are. \add Similarly, when you see what the people who come to you
do\add*, \add you will know if they are false prophets\add*.” 
\s Matthew 7:21-23 
\s Jesus warned that he will reject those who do not do what God desires.
\p
\v 21 “\add Even though many\add* people \add habitually\add* call me ‘Lord’,
\add pretending that they have my authority\add*, some of them will not go to heaven where God rules,
\add because they do not do what he desires\add*. \add Only\add* those people who do what my Father, who is in heaven, desires
\add will go there\add*. 
\v 22 On the day \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add that God judges everyone\add*, many \add people, trying to tell me that they deserve to go to
heaven\add*, will say to me, ‘Lord, we(exc) spoke God's message as your representatives [MTY, RHQ]! As your representatives
we(exc) expelled demons from \add people\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*! And as your representatives, many times we(exc) performed miracles \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*!’
\v 23 Then I will declare to them, ‘I have never said that you belonged to me. Go away from me, you who do what is evil!’ ”
\s Matthew 7:24-27 
\s Jesus warned that undesirable things would happen to those who did not obey his teaching.
\p
\v 24 “So then, anyone who hears what I say and does what I command, will be like a wise man who built his house on rock.
\v 25  \add Even though\add* the rain came down and the river flooded, and the winds blew and beat against that house, it did
not fall down because it had been built {he built it} on a solid foundation.
\v 26 On the other hand, anyone who hears what I say but does not obey what I say will be like a foolish man who built his
house on the sand. 
\v 27 When the rain fell and the river flooded, and the winds blew and beat against that house, it crashed down and broke
completely apart, \add because it was built on the sand. So it is important for you to obey what I teach
you\add*.” 
\s Matthew 7:28-29 
\s The crowds were amazed at Jesus, because he taught with his own authority.
\p
\v 28 When Jesus finished saying all those things, the crowd \add who had heard him
was\add* amazed at the \add new\add* teaching that he had taught them.
\v 29 The reason they were amazed was that he was teaching as a person does who has
\add his own\add* authority. He was not teaching like the men who taught the
\add Jewish\add* laws, \add who just repeated what other people had taught
them\add*.
