\s Matthew 17:1-8 
\s Jesus' appearance changed while Moses and Elijah talked with him on a mountain.
\p
\v 1 A week after Jesus\add said that\add*, he took Peter, James, and John, the
\add younger\add* brother of James, and led them up a high mountain where they were away from other people.
\v 2  \add While they were there, the three disciples\add* saw that Jesus' appearance was changed. His face shone like the sun,
and his clothing \add shone and\add* became as brilliant as light.
\v 3 Suddenly Moses and Elijah, \add who were important prophets many years
ago\add*, appeared and started talking with him. 
\v 4 Peter \add saw them and\add* said to Jesus, "Lord, it is wonderful for us to be here! If you want
\add me to\add*, I will make three shelters, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
\v 5 While Peter was speaking, a bright cloud \add appeared and\add* covered them.
\add They heard God\add* speaking \add about Jesus from\add* inside the cloud. He said
\add to them\add*, "This is my Son. I love him. He pleases me very much.
\add So\add* you must listen to him!" 
\v 6 When the three disciples heard \add God speaking\add*, they were exceedingly afraid.
\add As a result\add*, they fell prostrate on the ground. 
\v 7 But Jesus went to them and touched them \add and\add* said \add to
them\add*, "Stand up! Do not be afraid anymore!" 
\v 8 And when they looked up \f + \ft metonymy \f*, they saw that Jesus was the only one
\add who was still there\add*. 
\s Matthew 17:9-13 
\s Jesus explained that John the Baptizer fulfilled the prophecy about Elijah returning.
\p
\v 9 When they were walking down the mountain, Jesus commanded them, "Do not tell anyone what you saw
\add on the mountain top\add* until \add God has caused me\add*, the one who has come from heaven, to become alive again after
I die." 
\v 10  \add Those three disciples had just seen Elijah and he did not do anything to prepare people for the coming of the
Messiah\add*, so they asked Jesus, "If \add what you say is true\add*, why do the men who teach the
\add Jewish\add* laws say that it is necessary for Elijah to come
\add back to earth\add* before \add the Messiah comes\add*?" 
\v 11 Jesus answered \add them\add*, "It is true that \add God promised
that\add* Elijah would come to prepare many \f + \ft hyperbole \f* \add people for the Messiah's
coming\add*. 
\v 12 But note this: Elijah's \add representative\add* has already come
\add and our leaders have seen him\add*, but they did not recognize him
\add as the one who would come before the Messiah\add*. Instead, they treated him
\add badly\add*, just like they desired. And those same rulers will soon treat
\add me\add*, the one who came from heaven, in the same manner."
\v 13 Then the three disciples understood that \add when he was talking about
Elijah\add*, he was referring to John the Baptizer. 
\s Matthew 17:14-21 
\s Jesus healed an epileptic boy, and he rebuked his disciples for not having enough faith to do miracles.
\p
\v 14 When \add Jesus and the three disciples\add* returned to the
\add rest of us disciples\add* and to the crowd \add that had gathered\add*, a man approached Jesus and knelt before him.
\v 15 He said \add to him\add*, "Sir\f + \ft Or: Lord \f*, have mercy on my son and
\add heal him!\add* He has epilepsy and suffers very much. \add Because of this
illness\add*, he has fallen in the fire and in the water many times.
\v 16 I brought him to your disciples \add in order that they might heal
him\add*, but they were not able to heal him." 
\v 17 Jesus responded \add by saying to everyone who had gathered
there\add*, "\add You who have seen how I help people\add* do not believe
\add that you can do anything! Your minds\add* are distorted. How long do I have to be with you
\add before you\add* are \add able to do what I do\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*? How long
\add do\add* I have to endure your \add not believing\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*? Bring the boy here to me!"
\v 18 When \add they brought the boy to Jesus\add*, Jesus rebuked the demon
\add that was causing the epilepsy\add*. \add As a result\add*, the demon came out of the boy, and the boy was healed from that
time onward. 
\v 19  \add Later, some of us\add* disciples approached Jesus. We asked him privately, "Why were
\bd we\bd*\add (exc)\add* not able to expel the demon?" 
\v 20-21 He answered us, "It is because you did not believe very much
\add in God's power\add*. Think about this: Mustard seeds \add are very small, but in this area they grow and produce
large\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add plants\add*. \add Similarly\add*, if your faith grows until you truly believe
\add that God will do what you ask him to\add*, you will be able to do anything \f + \ft litotes \f*!
You\add could even\add* say to this hill, 'Move from here to there!' and it would go
\add where you told it to go\add*." 
\s Matthew 17:22-23 
\s Jesus again predicted his death and resurrection. 
\p
\v 22 When \add we disciples\add* had gathered together in Galilee
\add district\add*, Jesus said to us, "\add I\add*, the one who came from heaven, will soon be handed over
{\add Someone\add* will soon hand me, the one who came from heaven, over} to the authorities \f + \ft synecdoche \f*.
\v 23 They will kill me. But \add God\add* will cause me to become alive again on the third day
\add after I am killed\add*." \add When we heard that\add*, we became very sad.
\s Matthew 17:24-27 
\s Jesus arranged for a miracle so that Peter could pay the Temple tax.
\p
\v 24 When we came to Capernaum \add city\add*, the men who collect taxes
\add for the Temple approached Peter and said to him\add*, "Your teacher pays the
\add Temple tax\add*, does he not?" 
\v 25 He answered \add them\add*, "Yes, \add he does pay it\add*." When we came into
\add Jesus'\add* house, \add before Peter began to talk about paying
taxes\add*, Jesus said \add to him\add*, "Simon, from whom do you think rulers collect revenue or taxes?
\add Do they collect taxes\add* from the citizens of their own \add country\add*, or from citizens of countries
\add they have conquered\add*?" 
\v 26 Peter answered \add him\add*, "From \add citizens of\add* other
\add countries\add*." Then Jesus said to him, "So citizens of their own
\add country\add* do not need to \add pay taxes\add*. 
\v 27 But\add even though the Temple is mine, pay the tax for us so that the Temple tax collectors will not become angry with
us. In order to get the money to pay it\add*, go to the lake. Cast your
\add fish line and\add* hook, and take the first fish that you catch. When you open its mouth, you will find a silver coin
\add that is worth enough to pay the tax\add* for you and me. Take that coin and give
\add it\add* to the Temple tax collectors."
