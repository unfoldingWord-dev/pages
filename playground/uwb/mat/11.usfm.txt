\c 11  
\p
\v 1 When Jesus had finished instructing \add us\add* twelve disciples
\add about what we should do, he sent us to various Israelite towns\add*. Then he went to teach and preach in
\add other Israelite\add* towns \add in that area\add*. 
\s Matthew 11:2-15 
\s Jesus showed the messengers from John the Baptizer that he was the Messiah, and he told the people that John was the man
like Elijah who was to prepare the way for the Messiah. 
\p
\v 2 While John \add the Baptizer\add* was in prison, he heard what
\add the man whom he thought was\add* the Messiah was doing. So he sent
\add some of\add* his disciples \add to him\add* in order 
\v 3 to ask him, “Are you the \add Messiah\add* who \add the prophets
prophesied\add* would come, or is it someone else that we should expect
\add to come\add*?” 
\v 4  \add After they asked\add* Jesus \add that question\add*, he answered them, “Go back and report to John what you hear
\add me telling people\add* and what you see \add me doing\add*.
\v 5 I \add am enabling\add* blind people to see and lame people to walk. I
\add am\add* healing\add people\add* who have leprosy. I \add am
enabling\add* deaf people to hear and dead people to become alive again. I
\add am\add* telling poor people \add God's\add* good message. 
\v 6  \add Also tell John that God\add* is pleased with people who do not stop believing in me
\add because what I do is not what they expected the Messiah to do\add*.”
\p
\v 7 When John's disciples had gone away, Jesus began to talk to the crowd of people about John. He said to them,
“\add Think about\add* what sort of person you went to see in the desolate area
\add when you went there to see John\add*. ◄\add You did not go there to listen to a man who constantly changed his message,
like\add* a reed that is blown {blows} back and forth in the wind \f + \fr metaphor \f*!/Did you go
there\add to listen to a man whose message changes continually like\add* long grass that is blown {blows} back and forth in the
wind \add changes its direction\add*?► [MET, RHQ] 
\v 8 Then what \add kind of person\add* did you go \add there\add* to see \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*?
◄\add You did not go there to see\add* a man who was wearing expensive
clothes.\add /Did you go there to see\add* a man who was wearing expensive clothes?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*
\add No! You know very well that\add* people who wear beautiful clothes reside in kings' palaces
\add and not in desolate areas\add*. 
\v 9 Then what \add kind of person\add* did you go to see \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*?
\add Did you go there\add* \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* \add to see John because he was\add* ◄a prophet/a person who speaks what God tells him to
say►? Yes! But I will tell you that \add John\add* is more \add important\add* than an
\add ordinary\add* prophet. 
\v 10 He is the one \add to whom God was referring when he said to the Messiah these
words\add* that are written {about whom \add the prophet Malachi\add* wrote}
\add in the Scriptures:\add* 
\q Listen! I am going to send my messenger \add to go\add* before you \f + \fr synecdoche \f* to
prepare\add the people\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f* for your coming. 
\p
\v 11 Note this: Of all the people who have ever lived, \add God does not
consider\add* that any of them are greater than John the Baptizer. However,
\add God considers that all\add* those people who have let God rule their lives are greater than
\add John, even if they are insignificant people\add*. 
\v 12 From the time that John the Baptizer\add preached\add* until now,
\add other people\add* have violently attacked the people who have
\add allowed\add* God [MTY/EUP] to rule their lives and they have suffered (OR, people have very eagerly been asking God to
take control of their lives, OR, Israelite people \add who have thought that I would become their
king\add* have been extremely eager to be included in my kingdom) (OR, have been violently attacked and made to suffer).
\v 13  \add All this that I am saying about John is confirmed by the fact
that\add* all the men who wrote the Scriptures [MTY, SYN] foretold
\add about God ruling people's lives\add*, until John \add the Baptizer
came\add*. 
\v 14  \add Even though most of you are unwilling to believe what I am saying, I will tell this truth
to\add* anyone who is willing to believe \add it:\add* John is \add the man who is
like\add* Elijah \f + \fr metaphor \f*. He is the one who \add one of the prophets
said\add* would come \add in order to prepare the people to welcome the
Messiah\add*. 
\v 15 If you want to understand this, you must think \add carefully\add* \f + \fr metonymy \f*
\add about what I have just said\add* \f + \fr metonymy \f*.” 
\s Matthew 11:16-19 
\s Jesus rebuked the people who refused to believe both him and John the Baptizer.
\p
\v 16 “◄I will illustrate what \add you\add* people who have heard what John
\add the Baptizer\add* and I have taught are like./Do you know what
\add you\add* people who have heard what John and I have taught are like?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* You are like children who are
\add playing games\add* in an open area. \add Some of the children\add* are calling to the others, saying,
\v 17 ‘We played \add happy music\add* on the flute for you, but you did not dance! Then we sang sad funeral songs for you, but
you did not cry \f + \fr metaphor \f*!’ 
\v 18  \add Similarly, you are dissatisfied with both John and me!\add* When John came
\add and preached to you\add*, he did not eat \add good food\add* and did not drink
\add wine, like most people do\add*. But you \add rejected him\add* saying, ‘A demon is controlling him!’
\v 19  \add In contrast\add*, \add I\add*, the one who came from heaven, eat
\add the same\add* food and drink \add wine as other people do\add*. But you
\add reject me\add*, saying, ‘Look! \add This man\add* eats too much food and drinks too much wine, and he associates with tax
collectors and \add other\add* sinners!’ But people \add who really think
about\add* what \add John\add* and I have done will realize that what we do is truly wise [MET, PRS].”
\s Matthew 11:20-24 
\s Jesus explained why the people of Corazin, Bethsaida, and Capernaum would be punished more severely than the people of Tyre,
Sidon, and Sodom. 
\p
\v 20  \add The people, who lived in\add* the towns \f + \fr metonymy \f* \add in the area where Jesus was, saw
him\add* perform many miracles. But they did not turn away from their sinful behavior. So Jesus began to reproach them
\add by saying to them\add*, 
\v 21 “You \add people who live in\add* Chorazin \add city\add* \f + \fr metonymy \f* and you
\add people who live in\add* Bethsaida \add city\add* \f + \fr metonymy \f* will suffer terribly in hell!
\add I\add* did great miracles in your \add cities, but you did not turn from your sinful
behavior\add*. If the miracles that I performed in your \add cities\add* had been done in
\add the ancient cities of\add* Tyre and Sidon, the \add wicked people who lived
there\add* long ago would have sat in ashes, wearing coarse cloth
\add to show that they were sorry for their sins\add*. 
\v 22 So note this: \add God will punish the wicked people who lived in the cities
of\add* Tyre and Sidon \f + \fr metonymy \f*, but he will punish you even more severely on the final day when he judges
\add all people\add*. 
\v 23 I \add also have something to say to\add* you \add people who live
in\add* Capernaum \add city\add* \f + \fr metonymy \f*. ◄Do not \add think that\add* you will be honored
{that\add God\add* will honor you} in heaven!/Do you think that you will be honored
{that\add God\add* will honor you} in heaven?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* \add That will not happen! On the
contrary\add*, \add after you die, you will be sent\add* {\add God\add* will send you} down into the place where
\add sinful people\add* will be punished {he will punish sinful people}
\add forever\add*! \add God destroyed the ancient city of\add* Sodom
\add because the people who lived in that city were extremely wicked\add*. If I had performed in
\add Sodom the miracles that I performed in your city, the people there would have turned away from their wicked behavior
and\add* their \add city\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f* would still exist now \f + \fr metonymy \f*. But you,
\add although I did miracles in your city, did not turn from your wicked
behavior\add*. 
\v 24 So note this: \add God\add* will punish \add the people who lived
in\add* Sodom \add city\add* \f + \fr metonymy \f*, but he will punish you \add even\add* more severely on the final day when
\add he\add* judges \add all people\add*.” 
\s Matthew 11:25-30 
\s Jesus thanked God for revealing his truth to uneducated people, and he urged the people to come to him to get rid of the
burden of trying to obey religious laws. 
\p
\v 25 At that time Jesus prayed, “Father, you rule over \add everything
in\add* heaven and \add on\add* the earth. I thank you that you have prevented
\add people who think that they\add* are wise \f + \fr irony \f* because they are well-educated from
\add knowing\add* these things. \add Instead\add*, you have revealed them to
\add people who accept your truth as readily as\add* little children \f + \fr metaphor \f*
\add do\add*. 
\v 26 Yes, Father, \add you have done that\add* because it seemed good to you
\add to do\add* so.” 
\p
\v 27  \add Then Jesus said to the people there who wanted him to teach
them\add*, “\add God\add*, my Father, has revealed to me all the
things\add that I need to know in order to do my work\add*. Only my Father knows
\add who\add* I \add really am\add*. Furthermore, only I and those
\add people\add* to whom I wish to reveal him know \add what God\add* my Father
\add is like\add*. 
\v 28 Come to me, all you people who are very weary \add of trying to obey all the many laws that your religious teachers tell
you to obey\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f*. I will enable you to quit\add trying to obey all those
laws\add*. 
\v 29-30 Let me \add help\add* you \add carry those loads, just like two oxen who
have\add* a yoke \add on their necks\add* [MET, DOU] \add help each other pull a heavy
load\add*. It will not be difficult for you to do the things that I ask you to do for me \f + \fr doublet \f*. Because I am gentle and humble
\f + \fr doublet \f*, accept what I teach \add about what God wants you to do\add*.
\add And as a result, you will quit worrying about obeying all the religious laws,
and\add* your spirits will be at peace.”
