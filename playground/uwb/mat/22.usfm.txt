\s Matthew 22:1-14 
\s Jesus told a parable about a wedding feast to illustrate what will happen to people who do not accept him as the Messiah.
\p
\v 1 Then Jesus told \add the Jewish leaders\add* other parables
\add in order to illustrate what will happen to the people who do not accept him as the King God promised to
send\add*. \add This is one of those parables:\add* 
\v 2 “\add God\add* [MTY/EUP] \add is like\add* a king \f + \fk simile \f* who
\add told his servants that they should\add* make a wedding feast for his son.
\v 3  \add When\add* the feast\add was ready\add*, the king sent his servants to tell the people who had been {whom he had}
invited that it was time for them to come to the wedding feast. \add The servants did
that\add*. But the people who had been invited did not want to come.
\v 4 So he sent other servants \add to\add* again\add tell the people whom he had invited that they should come to the
feast\add*. He said \add to those servants\add*, ‘Say to the people whom I invited
\add to come to the feast\add*, “This is what the king says to you, ‘I inform you that I have prepared the meal. The oxen and
the fattened calves have been butchered \add and cooked\add*. Everything is ready. It is time
\add now for you to\add* come to the wedding feast!’”’ 
\v 5  \add But when the servants told them that, they\add* disregarded
\add what the servants said\add*. Some of them went to their own fields. Others went to their places of business.
\v 6 The rest of them seized the king's servants, mistreated them, and killed them.
\v 7  \add When the king heard what had happened\add*, he became furious. He commanded his soldiers to go and kill those
murderers and burn their cities. 
\v 8  \add After his soldiers had done that\add*, the king said to his other servants, ‘I have prepared the
\add wedding\add* feast, but the people who were {whom I} invited do not deserve to
\add come to it because they did not consider it an honor to have been
invited\add*. 
\v 9 So, go to the intersections of the main streets. Tell whomever you find that they should come to the
\add wedding\add* feast.’ 
\v 10 So the servants went there, and they gathered everyone they saw
\add who wanted to come to the feast\add*. They gathered \add both people that were
considered\add* to be evil and \add those that were considered to
be\add* good. They brought them into the hall where the wedding \add feast took
place\add*. The hall was filled with people. 
\v 11 But when the king went \add into the hall\add* to see the guests who were there, he saw someone who was not wearing
clothes \add that had been provided for the guests to wear\add* at a wedding
\add feast\add*. 
\v 12 The king said to him, ‘Friend, ◄you should never have entered this hall, because you are not wearing the clothes
\add that guests wear\add* at wedding \add feasts\add*!/how did you enter this hall, because you are not wearing the clothes
\add that are appropriate for guests to wear\add* at a wedding \add feast\add*?► \f + \fk rhetorical question \f*’ The man did not say anything,
\add because he did not know what to say\add*. 
\v 13 Then the king said to his attendants, ‘Tie this person's feet and hands and throw him outside where there is total
darkness. People who are there cry out \add because they are suffering\add* and they gnash their teeth
\add because of their severe pain\add*.’” 
\v 14  \add Then Jesus said, “The point of this story is that God\add* has invited many
\add to come to him\add*, but only a few people are the ones whom he has chosen
\add to be there\add*.” 
\s Matthew 22:15-22 
\s Jesus taught his critics that they needed to give to God and to the government what they each required.
\p
\v 15 After Jesus said that, the Pharisees met together in order to plan how they could cause him to say something that would
enable them to accuse him. 
\v 16 They sent to him some of their disciples, \add who thought that the Israelites should pay only the tax that the Jewish
authorities required them to pay\add*. They also sent some members of the party that supported Herod.
\add The members of that party thought that the Israelites should pay only the tax that the Roman government required them to
pay\add*. \add Those who were sent came and\add* said to Jesus, “Teacher, we know that you are truthful and that you teach the
truth about what God wants\add us to do\add*. We also know that you do not change what you teach because of what someone says
about you, even if it is an important person who does not like what you \f + \fk idiom \f* teach.
\v 17 So tell us what you think \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* \add about this matter\add*: Is it right that we pay taxes to the Roman government \f + \fk metonymy \f*,
or not?” 
\v 18 But Jesus knew that what they really wanted to do was evil.
\add They were wanting him to say something that would get him in trouble with either the Jewish authorities or the Roman
authorities. So he said to them\add*, “You are ◄hypocrites/pretending to ask a legitimate question►, but you are just wanting
\f + \fk rhetorical question \f* me to say something for which you can accuse me. 
\v 19 Show me \add one of\add* the coins with \add which people pay\add*
the\add Roman\add* tax.” So they showed him \add a coin called\add* a denarius.
\v 20 He said to them, “Whose picture is \add on\add* this \add coin\add*? And
\add whose\add* name \add is on it\add*?” 
\v 21 They answered, “\add It has the picture and name of\add* Caesar,
\add the head of the Roman government\add*.” Then he said to them, “Okay, give to the government what they
\add require\add*, and give to God what he \add requires\add*.” 
\v 22 When those men heard Jesus say that, they marveled \add that his answer did not enable anyone to accuse
him\add*. Then they left Jesus. 
\s Matthew 22:23-33 
\s Jesus showed from the Scriptures that the spirits of God's people are alive after death.
\p
\v 23 During that same day, some Sadducees came to Jesus. \add They are a Jewish sect who do
not\add* believe that people will become alive again after they die. They
\add wanted to\add* ask \add Jesus\add* a question. 
\v 24  \add In order to discredit the idea that dead people will live
again\add*, they said \add to him\add*, “Teacher, Moses wrote \add in the
Scriptures\add*, ‘If a man dies who did not have any children, his brother must marry the
\add dead man's\add* widow in order that she can have a child by him. The child
\add will be considered\add* the descendant of the man \add who died\add*,
\add and in that way the dead man will have descendants\add*.’ 
\v 25 Well, there were seven boys in a family\add living\add* near us. The oldest one married someone. He
\add and his wife\add* did not have any children, and he died. So the second brother married the widow.
\add But he also died without having a child\add*. 
\v 26 The same thing \add happened to\add* the third \add brother\add*, and also to the other four
\add brothers, who one by one married this same woman\add*. 
\v 27 Last of all, the widow also died. 
\v 28 So, at the time when people are raised from the dead, which of the seven
\add brothers do you think\add* will be her husband? Keep in mind that they had all been married to her.”
\v 29 Jesus replied to them, “You are certainly wrong \add in what you are
thinking\add*. You do not know \add what is written in\add* the Scriptures.
\add You\add* also do not know \add that\add* God has \add the\add* power
\add to make people alive again\add*. 
\v 30 The fact is that \add the woman will not be the wife of any of them,
because\add* after \add God causes all dead\add* people\add to\add* live again, no one will be married. Instead,
\add people\add* will be like the angels in heaven. \add They do not
marry\add*. 
\v 31 But as to dead people becoming alive again, God said something about that. ◄I'm sure you have read it./Have you not read
it?► \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* \add Long after Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob had died, God said to
Moses\add*, 
\v 32 ‘I am the God whom Abraham \add worships\add* and the God whom Isaac
\add worships\add* and the God whom Jacob worships.’ It is not dead people who worship God. It is living people who worship
him. \add Abraham, Isaac and Jacob died long before Moses lived, but God said that they were still worshipping him, so we know
their spirits were still alive!\add*” 
\p
\v 33 When the crowds of people heard \add Jesus teach\add* that, they were amazed.
\s Matthew 22:34-40 
\s Jesus told his critics that the greatest commandments are to love God and to love others.
\p
\v 34 But when the Pharisees heard that Jesus had answered the Sadducees in such a way that the Sadducees could not
\add think of anything that they might say to\add* respond to him, the Pharisees gathered together to
\add plan what they would say to him\add*. \add Then they approached
him\add*. 
\v 35 One of them was a man who had studied well the laws \add that God gave
Moses\add*. He wanted to see if Jesus \add could answer\add* his question well
\add or if he would say something wrong\add*. He asked him, 
\v 36 “Teacher, which commandment in the laws \add that God gave
Moses\add* is the most important?” 
\v 37 Jesus \add quoted the Scriptures as he replied\add*, “‘You must love the Lord your God with all \f + \fk idiom \f* your ◄inner
being/heart►. \add Show that you love him\add* in all that you desire, in all that you feel, and in all that you think.’
\v 38 That is the most important commandment \add in the laws that God gave
Moses\add*. 
\v 39 The next most important commandment \add that everyone must surely
obey\add* is: ‘You must love the people you come in contact with as much as
\add you love\add* yourself.’ 
\v 40 These two commandments are the basis of every law \add that Moses wrote in the
Scriptures\add* and also of all that the prophets \add wrote\add*.”
\s Matthew 22:41-46 
\s Jesus showed that the Messiah must be greater than King David, and not just his descendant.
\p
\v 41 While the Pharisees were still gathered together \add near\add* Jesus, he asked them,
\v 42 “What do you think about the Messiah? Whose descendant is he?” They said to him,
“\add He is\add* the descendant of \add King\add* David.” 
\v 43 Jesus said to them, “\add If the Messiah is King David's descendant\add*, then ◄David should not have called him ‘Lord’
when David was saying \add what\add* the \add Holy\add* Spirit \add prompted him
to\add* say./Why did David call the Messiah ‘Lord’ when David was speaking
\add what\add* the \add Holy\add* Spirit \add prompted him to\add* say?► \f + \fk rhetorical question \f*
\v 44  \add David wrote this in the Scriptures about the Messiah\add*: ‘God said to my Lord, “Sit
\add here beside me\add* on my right, \add where I will greatly honor
you\add* \f + \fk metonymy \f*. \add Sit here\add* while I completely defeat your enemies \f + \fk metonymy \f*.”’
\v 45 So, since \add King\add* David called \add the Messiah\add* ‘my Lord’,
◄\add the Messiah\add* cannot be \add just someone\add* descended from David!/how can he be
\add only\add* the descendant of \add King\add* David?► \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* \add He must be much greater than
David\add*!” 
\v 46 No one \add who heard what Jesus said\add* was able to think of even one word to say to him
\add in response\add*. And after that, no one else ever dared to ask him another question
\add to try to trap him\add*.
