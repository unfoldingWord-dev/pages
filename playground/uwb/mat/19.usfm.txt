\c 19  
\s Matthew 19:1-12 
\s Jesus taught them God's view of divorce, and about abstaining from marriage to give more time to serve God.
\p
\v 1 After Jesus had said that, he \add took us\add* and left Galilee
\add district\add* and went to the part of Judea \add district that is
located\add* on the \add east\add* side of the Jordan \add River\add*.
\v 2 Large crowds followed him there, and he healed \add the sick
among\add* them there. 
\p
\v 3  \add Some\add* Pharisees approached him and said to him, "Does
\add our Jewish\add* law permit \add a man\add* to divorce his wife for any reason whatever?"
\add They asked that\add* in order to be able to criticize him, \add whether he answered "Yes" or
"No\add*." 
\v 4 Jesus said \add to them\add*, "\add Because\add* you have read \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\add the Scriptures\add*, \add you should know\add* that at the time
\add God first\add* created \add people\add*, 'he made \add one\add* man, and he made
\add one\add* woman \add to be that man's wife\add*.' 
\v 5 That explains why \add God said\add*, '\add When\add* a man
\add and woman marry\add*, they should no longer live with their fathers and mothers.
\add Instead\add*, the two of them shall live together, and they shall become
\add so closely united that they are like\add* one person \f + \ft metaphor \f*.'
\v 6 Consequently, \add although they functioned as\add* two \add separate people
before\add*, they now \add become as if they were\add* one person \f + \ft metaphor \f*. Since that is true, a man must not separate
\add from his wife\add* whom God has joined to him, \add because it is God's plan for them to remain
together\add*." 
\p
\v 7 The Pharisees then said to him, "If that is true, why did Moses command that
\add a man who wanted to divorce\add* his wife should give her a paper
\add stating his reason for\add* divorcing her, and then send her away?"
\v 8 He said to them, "It was because\add your ancestors\add* stubbornly
\add wanted their own ways\add* that Moses allowed them to divorce their wives,
\add and you are no different from them\add*. But when God first \f + \ft metonymy \f* created a man and a woman,
\add he did not intend for them to separate\add*. 
\v 9 I am telling you emphatically that \add because God considers that a marriage lasts until either the husband or the wife
dies, he considers that\add* any man who divorces his wife and marries another woman is committing adultery,
unless\add his first wife\add* has committed adultery." 
\v 10 We disciples said to him, "If that is true, it is better for men never to marry!"
\v 11 Then he said to us, "Not every man is able to accept this teaching. Only the men whom
\add God\add* enables \add to accept it are able to do so\add*. 
\v 12 There are men who \add do not marry because they are not able to have sexual relations because
they\add* have been sexually defective ever since they were born. There are other men
\add who do not marry because they are unable to have sexual relations\add* because they have been castrated \f + \ft Or:other men have
made them that way \f*. There are other \add men who decide not to marry\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* in order that they can serve God better
\add and spend more time telling people about how\add* God [MTY\f + \ft Or: EUP \f*] wants to rule people's lives. You who are able to
understand \add what I have said about marriage\add* should accept it
\add and obey it\add*." 
\s Matthew 19:13-15 
\s Jesus rebuked the disciples for trying to prevent children from coming to him.
\p
\v 13 Then \add some\add* children were brought \f + \ft Or:\add some people\add* brought their children \f* to Jesus in order that he might
lay his hands on them and pray \add for them\add*. But we disciples scolded the people
\add for bringing their children to Jesus because we thought that Jesus did not want to take the time to be with
children\add*. 
\v 14 But\add when Jesus saw us scolding them\add*, he said to us, "Let the children come to me, and do not stop them! It is
people who are \add humble and trusting\add* like they are, who can experience [MTY\f + \ft Or: EUP \f*] God's rule
\add in their lives\add*." 
\v 15 Jesus then laid his hands on the children \add and asked God to bless
them\add*. Then he left there. 
\s Matthew 19:16-22 
\s A rich young man went away sad because Jesus told him to sell all his possessions.
\p
\v 16  \add As Jesus was walking along, a young\add* man approached him and said
\add to him\add*, "Teacher, what good \add deeds\add* must I do in order to live
\add with God\add* eternally?" 
\v 17 Jesus said to him, "Consider \add what you are implying about who I am
when\add* you ask me about what is good.\f + \ft Or: Do you realize \add what you are implying about who I am
when\add* you ask me about that which is good? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* Only one being is good and
\add really knows what is good. That being is God. But in order to answer your
question\add* about \add desiring to\add* live \add with God eternally\add*, I
\add will say to you\add*, 'Keep the commandments \add that God gave
Moses'\add*." 
\v 18 The man asked Jesus, "Which \add commandments must I keep\add*?" Jesus answered
\add him\add*, "Do not murder \add anyone\add*, do not commit adultery, do not steal things, do not testify falsely,
\v 19 honor your father and your mother, and love people you come in contact with as
\add much as you love\add* yourself." 
\v 20  \add Thinking that he might not be able to live with God eternally even though he had kept those
commandments\add*, the young man said to Jesus, "I have always obeyed all those commandments. What else must I do
\add in order to live with God eternally\add*?" 
\v 21 Jesus said to him, "If you desire to be all that God intends you to be, go
\add home\add*, sell everything that you have and give \add the money\add* to poor people.
\add The result will be that\add* you will have \add spiritual\add* riches in heaven. Then come and be my disciple!"
\v 22 When the young man heard those words, he went away feeling sad, because he was very rich
\add and did not want to give away everything he owned\add*. 
\s Matthew 19:23-30 
\s Jesus taught how difficult it is for rich people to let God rule their lives, but there are rewards for those who leave
family and possessions for his sake. 
\p
\v 23 Then Jesus said to \add us\add* disciples, "Keep this in mind: It is very difficult for rich people
\add to decide\add* to let God [MTY\f + \ft Or: EUP \f*] rule their \add lives\add*.
\v 24 Note this also: It is impossible for a camel to go through the eye of a needle. It is
\add almost\add* as difficult \f + \ft hyperbole \f* for rich people \add to decide\add* to let God rule their
\add lives\add*." 
\v 25 When \add we\add* disciples heard this, we became exceedingly astounded.
\add We thought that rich people were the ones whom God blesses the most. So we said to
him\add*, "If that is so, it does not seem likely that anyone will be saved!\f + \ft Or: Who then will God will save? \f*" \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 26  \add When Jesus heard us say that\add*, he looked intently at us, and
\add then\add* he said to us, "\add Yes\add*, it is impossible for people
\add to save themselves\add*. But \add God can save them, because\add* God is able to do
\add anything\add*!" 
\v 27 Then Peter said to him, "You know that we\add \f + \ft exclusive \f*\add* have left everything behind and we have become your disciples.
So what benefit will we get \add for doing that\add*?" 
\v 28 Jesus said to us, "Keep this in mind: \add You will get many
benefits\add*. When \add God\add* makes \add the\add* new \add earth\add* and when
\add I\add*, the one who came from heaven, sit on my magnificent throne, those of you who have accompanied me will each sit on
a throne, and you will judge \add the people of\add* the twelve tribes of Israel.
\v 29  \add God will reward\add* those who, because of being my \add disciples\add*, have left
\add behind\add* a house or plot of ground, \add their\add* brothers,
\add their\add* sisters, their father, their mother, their children,
\add or any other family\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add members\add*. \add God\add* will give them a hundred times
\add as many benefits as they have given up\add*. And they will live
\add with God\add* eternally. 
\v 30 But many \add people who consider themselves to\add* be important
\add now\add* will be unimportant \add at that future time\add*, and many
\add people who consider themselves to be\add* unimportant \add now will
be\add* important \add at that future time\add*."
