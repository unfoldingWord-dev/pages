\s Matthew 2:1-12 
\s After some astrologers saw an unusual star, they traveled westwards to find the place where the infant Jesus was. King Herod
helped direct them, but then an angel told them not to go back to King Herod.
\p
\v 1 Jesus was born in Bethlehem \add town\add* in Judea \add province\add* during the time \f + \fk metonymy \f* that King Herod
\add the Great ruled there. Some time\add* after Jesus was born, some men who studied the stars and who lived in a
\add country\add* east \add of Judea\add* came to Jerusalem \add city\add*.
\v 2 They asked \add people\add*, “Where is the one who has been born
\add in order that he might be\add* the king of \add you\add* Jews?
\add We believe that your new king\add* has been born, because we have seen the star
\add that we believe indicated that\add* he has been \add born\add*.
\add We saw it while we were in our country\add* east \add of here\add*. So we have come to worship him.”
\p
\v 3 When King Herod heard \add what those men were asking\add*, he became worried
\add that someone else might be proclaimed\add* {\add people might proclaim someone
else\add*} \add king of the Jews to replace him\add*. Many \add of the
people\add* of Jerusalem \add city\add* [MTY, HYP] \add also\add* became worried
\add because they were afraid of what King Herod might do\add*. 
\v 4 Then Herod gathered together all the ruling priests and men who taught the people the
\add Jewish\add* laws and he asked them where \add the prophets had predicted
that\add* the Messiah was to be born. 
\v 5 They said to him, “\add He will be born\add* in Bethlehem \add town,
here\add* in Judea \add province\add*, because it was written by the prophet
\add Micah\add* {the prophet \add Micah\add* wrote} \add long ago what God
said\add*: 
\v 6 ‘You \add who live in\add* Bethlehem \add town\add* \f + \fk apostrophe \f*, in Judea
\add province\add*, your town is certainly very important \f + \fk litotes \f*, because a man from your
\add town\add* will become a ruler. He will guide my people \add who live
in\add* Israel.’” 
\p
\v 7 Then \add King\add* Herod secretly summoned those men who studied the stars. He asked them exactly when the star
\add first\add* appeared. \add By what they told him, he was able to know the approximate age of the
baby\add*. 
\v 8 Then he \add concealed what he really planned to do and\add* said to them, “Go to Bethlehem and inquire thoroughly
\add where\add* the infant is. When you have found him, \add come back
and\add* report to me so that I, myself, can go\add there and\add* worship him, too.”
\p
\v 9 After the men heard what the king \add told them\add*, they went
\add toward Bethlehem town\add*. To their surprise, the star that they had seen while they were in the eastern
\add country\add* went ahead of them \add again\add* until it stood
above\add the house\add* where the child was. 
\v 10 When they saw the star, they rejoiced greatly \add and followed
it\add*. 
\v 11 They \add found\add* the house and entered it and saw the child and his mother, Mary. They bowed down and worshipped him.
Then they opened their treasure \add boxes\add* \f + \fk metonymy \f* and they gave gold,
\add costly\add* frankincense, and myrrh to him. 
\v 12  \add Because\add* God \add knew that King Herod planned to kill
Jesus\add*, in a dream the men who studied the stars were warned {he warned the men who studied the stars} that they should not
return to \add King\add* Herod. So they returned to their country,
\add but instead of traveling back on the same road, they\add* went on a different road.
\s Matthew 2:13-21 
\s Following an angel's instructions, Joseph took his family to country of Egypt to escape from Herod.
\p
\v 13 After the men who studied the stars left \add Bethlehem\add*, an angel
\add from\add* the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream. He said, “Get up, take the child and his mother, and flee into
\add the country of\add* Egypt. Stay there until I tell you\add (sg) that you should
leave\add*, because\add King\add* Herod is about \add to send soldiers\add* to look for the child so that they can kill him.”
\v 14 So Joseph got up, he took the child and his mother \add that\add* night, and they fled into Egypt.
\v 15 They stayed there until \add King\add* Herod died, \add and then they left
Egypt\add*. By doing that, it was {they} fulfilled what the prophet
\add Hosea\add* wrote, which had been said by the Lord {which the Lord had said},
\q I have told my son to come out of Egypt. 
\m
\v 16  \add While King\add* Herod \add was still living\add*, because he realized that he had been tricked by the men who
studied the stars {the men who studied the stars had tricked him}, he became furious. Then,
\add assuming that Jesus was still in Bethlehem or the surrounding
regions\add*, Herod sent \add soldiers there\add* to kill all the boy babies two years old and younger.
\add Herod calculated how old the baby was\add*, according to what the men who studied the stars told him
\add about when the star first appeared\add*. 
\v 17  \add Because Bethlehem and Ramah towns were in the area where the descendants of Jacob's wife Rachel lived, when
soldiers killed the infant boys\add*, they fulfilled what Jeremiah the prophet wrote,
\q
\v 18  \add Women\add* in Ramah were weeping and wailing loudly.
\add Women who were the descendants\add* of Rachel, \add the ancestor of the women
there\add* \f + \fk synecdoche \f*, were grieving for \add what happened to\add* their children.
\add Even though people tried to comfort them\add*, they would not be comforted {stop mourning} because their children were
dead \f + \fk euphemism \f*. 
\p
\v 19 After Herod died \add and while Joseph and his family were still in
Egypt\add*, an angel that the Lord \add had sent\add* appeared to Joseph in Egypt in a dream.
\v 20 He said to Joseph, “Take the child and his mother and go back to
\add the country of\add* Israel \add to live\add*, because the people who were looking for the child \f + \fk euphemism \f*
\add in order to kill him\add* have died.” 
\v 21 So Joseph took the child and his mother, and they went back to Israel.
\s Matthew 2:22-23 
\s Following an angel's warning, Joseph and his family returned to Nazareth, and thus a prophecy about the Messiah was
fulfilled. 
\p
\v 22 When Joseph heard that Archaelaus now ruled in Judea \add district\add* instead of his father,
\add King\add* Herod \add the Great\add*, he was afraid to go there. Because he was warned
{\add God\add* warned Joseph} in a dream \add that it was still dangerous for them to live in
Judea\add*, he \add and Mary and Jesus\add* went into Galilee \add District\add*
\v 23 to the town called Nazareth \add to live there\add*. The result was that what had been said by the ancient prophets {what
the ancient prophets had said} \add about the Messiah\add*, that he would be called {people would call him} a Nazareth-man, was
fulfilled {came true}.
