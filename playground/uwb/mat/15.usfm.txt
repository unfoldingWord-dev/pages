\c 15  
\s Matthew 15:1-9 
\s Jesus rebuked the religious leaders for ignoring God's commands in order to uphold their own religious traditions.
\p
\v 1 Then \add some\add* Pharisees and men who taught the \add Jewish\add* laws came from Jerusalem
\add to talk to\add* Jesus. They said, 
\v 2 "We think it is disgusting that your disciples disobey the traditions of our ancestors!\f + \ft Or: Why do your disciples disobey
\add what our ancestors wrote down and\add* our \add elders taught
us\add*? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* They do not perform the proper ritual of washing their hands before they eat!"
\v 3 Jesus answered them, "What is really disgusting is that \bd you\bd* refuse to obey God's
commands\add just\add* so that you can follow what your ancestors taught you!\f + \ft Or: Why do you refuse to obey what God commanded
\add people to do, just\add* so that you can follow your own traditions? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 4 God gave these \add two\add* commands: 'Honor your father and your mother,' and 'People who speak evil about their father
or mother must be executed.' 
\v 5 But you tell people, 'You can say to your father or mother, "What I was going to give to you
\add to help provide for you\add*, \add I have now promised\add* to
give\add to God\add*."' 
\v 6 And if you do that, you think that you do not need to give anything to your parents. In
\add that way\add*, \add by teaching people\add* your traditions, you disregard what God commanded.
\v 7 You only pretend to be good! Isaiah prophesied accurately about you
\add also when he quoted what God said about your ancestors. God
said\add*, 
\v 8 'These people talk \add as if they\add* honor me \f + \ft metonymy \f*, but they do not think about honoring me at all \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\v 9 It is useless for them to worship me, because they teach what people thought up
\add as if I myself had commanded it\add*.'" 
\s Matthew 15:10-11 
\s Jesus said that people are defiled by the words that come out of their mouths, rather than by any kind of food that they
eat. 
\p
\v 10 Then Jesus\add again\add* summoned the crowd to come \add nearer\add* to him. Then he said to them, "Listen to
\add what I am about to tell you\add*, and\add try to\add* understand it.
\v 11 Nothing that a person puts into his mouth \add to eat\add* causes
\add God to consider\add* that person to be unacceptable. Instead, it is
\add the words\add* that come out of people's mouths \f + \ft synecdoche \f* that cause
\add God to reject them\add*." 
\s Matthew 15:12-20 
\s Jesus explained that people's inner thoughts are what make them unacceptable to God.
\p
\v 12 Later we disciples went to Jesus and said, "Do you know that the Pharisees heard what you said, and as a result they felt
offended \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*?" 
\v 13 Then, \add to teach us what God would do to the Pharisees\add*, Jesus told
\add us this parable\add*: "My Father in heaven \add will\add* get rid of all
\add those who teach things that are contrary to his truth, just like a
farmer\add* gets rid of plants that he did not plant by pulling them up along with their roots \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\v 14 Do not pay any attention to \add the Pharisees\add*. They \add do not help people who do not know God's
truth\add* to \add understand it, just like\add* blind guides \add do not
help\add* blind \add people to perceive where they should go\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. If a blind person
\add tries to\add* lead \add another\add* blind person, they will both fall into a hole \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\add Similarly, both the Pharisees and their disciples will end up in
hell\add*." 
\p
\v 15 Peter said to Jesus, "Explain to us the parable \add about what a person
eats\add*." 
\v 16 He replied \add to them\add*, "I am disappointed that even you,
\add who should understand what I teach\add*, still do not understand!\f + \ft Or: Why is it that even you
\add who should understand what I teach\add*, still do not understand? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\v 17 You ought to understand that all \add food that people\add* eat enters their stomachs, and later the refuse passes out
of their \add bodies\add*.\f + \ft Or: Cannot you understand that all \add food that
people\add* eat enters their stomachs and later the refuse passes out
\add of their bodies\add*? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add Because food does not alter what we think and desire, what we eat does not cause God to
consider that we are unacceptable to him\add*. 
\v 18  \add You should know that\add* what comes out of \add people's\add* mouths,
\add meaning everything that they say\add* \f + \ft synecdoche \f*, comes from their inner beings\f + \ft Or: hearts \f*. Many of the
\add things that they say\add* cause \add God to consider\add* them to be unacceptable
\add to him\add*. 
\v 19 It is people's innermost beings that \add cause them\add* to think things that are evil, to murder people, to
\add commit\add* adultery, to commit other sexual sins, to steal things, to testify falsely, and to speak evil about
\add others\add*. 
\v 20 It is these actions that cause \add God to consider\add* people to be unacceptable
\add to him\add*. To eat with unwashed hands does not cause\add God to
consider\add* people unacceptable to him." 
\s Matthew 15:21-28 
\s Jesus healed a non-Jewish woman's daughter after testing the mother's faith in him.
\p
\v 21 After Jesus \add took us and\add* left \add Galilee district\add*, we went into the region
\add where the cities of\add* Tyre and Sidon \add are located\add*.
\v 22 A woman \add from the group of people called\add* Canaanites who live in that region came
\add to the place where Jesus was staying\add*. She kept shouting
\add to him\add*, "Lord, you are the descendant of \add King\add* David,
\add you are the Messiah!\add* Have pity on me \add and my daughter!\add* She is suffering very much because a demon controls
her." 
\v 23 But Jesus did not answer her at all. \add We\add* disciples came to him, and
\add knowing that the woman was not a Jew\add*, we said to him, "Tell her to leave because she keeps
\add bothering us\add* by yelling behind us!" 
\v 24 But Jesus said \add to her\add*, "I have been sent \f + \ft Or:\add God\add* has sent me \f* to
\add help\add* only the Israelite people \add at this time\add* \f + \ft synecdoche \f*.
\add They are like\add* sheep that have gotten lost \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add because they do not know the way to
heaven\add*." 
\v 25 But she came \add closer\add* to Jesus and knelt down in front of him
\add to worship him\add*. She pled, "Lord\f + \ft Or: Sir \f*, help me!" 
\v 26 Then, \add to suggest to her that he needed to help the Jews first and not the non-Jews, whom the Jews called
dogs\add*, he told her, "It is not good \add for someone\add* to take food
\add that has been prepared for\add* the children and throw it to the
\add little\add* dogs." 
\v 27  \add But to show that she believed that non-Jews could also receive help from
God\add*, the woman said \add to Jesus\add*, "Lord\f + \ft Or: Sir \f*, what you
\add say is\add* correct, but even the \add little\add* dogs eat the crumbs that fall to the floor
\add when\add* their masters\add sit at\add* their tables \add and
eat\add*!" 
\v 28 Then Jesus said to her, "O woman, \add because\add* you believe firmly
\add in me, I\add* will \add heal your daughter\add* as you desire!" At that moment
\add the demon left\add* her daughter, \add and she\add* became well.
\s Matthew 15:29-31 
\s Jesus healed many people on a hillside near Galilee lake. 
\p
\v 29 After Jesus, \add along with us disciples\add*, departed from that area, we went
\add back\add* to Galilee lake \add and walked\add* along it. Then Jesus climbed the hill
\add near there\add* and sat down \add to teach the people\add*.
\v 30 Crowds kept coming to him for the next two days and brought lame, crippled, and blind people, those who were unable to
talk, and many others \add who had various sicknesses\add*. They laid them in front of Jesus
\add so that he would heal them\add* \f + \ft synecdoche \f*. And he healed them. 
\v 31 The crowd saw \add him heal\add* people who could not talk, crippled people, lame people, and blind people, and they were
amazed. They said, "Praise God \add who rules over us who live in\add* Israel!"
\s Matthew 15:32-39 
\s Jesus miraculously fed over 4,000 people. 
\p
\v 32 Then Jesus called us disciples to him and said \add to us\add*, "This crowd
\add of people\add* has been with me for three days and have nothing
\add left\add* to eat. I feel sorry for them. I do not want to send them away
\add while they are still\add* hungry, \add because if I did that\add*, they might faint on the
way\add home\add*." 
\v 33 We disciples said to him, "In this place where nobody lives, we cannot possibly obtain enough food to feed such a large
crowd!\f + \ft Or: how can we obtain a large enough amount of food to feed such a large crowd? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*"
\v 34 Jesus asked us, "How many small loaves do you have?" We said to him,
"\add We have\add* seven small loaves and a few \add cooked\add* fish."
\v 35 He told the people to sit on the ground. 
\v 36 Then he took the seven small loaves and the fish. After he thanked
\add God for them\add*, he broke them\add into pieces\add*, and he kept giving
\add them\add* to us. Then we \add kept distributing\add* them to the crowd.
\v 37-38  \add Because Jesus made the food multiply miraculously\add*, all
\add those people\add* ate and had \add plenty to\add* satisfy \add them\add*. There were four thousand men
\add who ate\add*, but no\add one counted\add* the women and the children
\add who also ate\add*. Then we \add disciples\add* collected the pieces of food that were left over, and we filled seven large
baskets \add with them\add*. 
\p
\v 39 After Jesus dismissed the crowd, he, \add along with us\add*, got in the boat, and we sailed
\add around the lake\add* to the region called Magadan.
