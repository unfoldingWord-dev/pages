\c 6  
\s Matthew 6:1-13 
\s Jesus taught how we should give to needy people. He also taught his disciples how to pray.
\p
\v 1 “When you do your good deeds, make certain that you do not do them when other people are watching so that they may see you
\add and think highly of you\add*. If \add you do good deeds merely in order that other people may think highly of you,
God\add*, your Father who is in heaven, will not give you any reward.
\v 2 So, whenever you give something to the poor, do not \add announce it as people announce something that they want other
people to know about\add* by playing a \add fanfare\add* on a trumpet \f + \fr metaphor \f*. That is what the hypocrites do ◄in the
synagogues/in the Jewish meeting places► and on the main roads in order that people might
\add see what they do and\add* praise them. Keep this in mind: \add People praise those
hypocrites\add*, \add but\add* that is the \add only\add* reward they will receive!
\v 3 Instead \add of doing as they do\add*, when you give something to the poor, do not let other people know that you are
doing that \f + \fr metaphor \f*. 
\v 4 In that way, you will be giving to the poor secretly. \add As a result
God\add*, your Father who observes \add you\add* while no one else sees
\add you\add*, will reward you. 
\p
\v 5 “Also when you pray, do not do what the hypocrites do. They like to stand in the Jewish meeting places and on the corners
of the main streets to pray, in order that other people will see them
\add and think highly of them\add*. Keep this in mind: \add People praise them,
but\add* that is the\add only\add* reward they will get. 
\v 6 But as for you, when you pray, go into your private room and close the door in order to pray to
\add God\add*, your Father, whom no one can see. He observes you where no one else observes you, and he will reward you.
\v 7 When you pray, do not repeat words many times as the people who do not know God do
\add when they pray. They repeat meaningless words\add* because they think that if they use many words, their gods will listen
to them and give them \add what they ask for\add*. 
\v 8 Do not \add repeat words\add* as they do, because \add God\add* your Father knows what you need before you ask him.
\v 9 So pray \add things\add* like this: Father, \add you who are\add* in heaven,
we\add (exc)\add* desire that you be honored/revered {that people honor/revere you}.
\v 10 We\add (exc)\add* desire that people let you rule \add over their
lives\add*. We(exc) want \add people who live\add* on the earth to do what you desire, as those who live in heaven
\add do what you want them to do\add*. 
\v 11 Give us\add (exc)\add* each day the food \f + \fr synecdoche \f* that we\add (exc) need
for\add* that day. 
\v 12 Forgive our sins just like we\add (exc)\add* have forgiven the people who sin against
us\add (exc)\add*. 
\v 13 Do not let us(exc) do wrong things when we(exc) are tempted {someone or something tempts us}, and rescue
us\add (exc)\add* when \bd Satan\bd* the evil one tempts us to do evil
things.\f +  \fqa people should praise you forever.”\f*” 
\s Matthew 6:14-15 
\s Jesus taught more about forgiving others. 
\p
\v 14 “\add Forgive the people who sin against you\add*, because, if you forgive other people,
\add God\add*, your Father who is in heaven, will forgive your \add sins\add*.
\v 15 But if you do not forgive other people, neither will God forgive your sins.”
\s Matthew 6:16-18 
\s Jesus taught about abstaining from food. 
\p
\v 16 “When you abstain from eating food \add in order to please
God\add*, do not look sad as the hypocrites look. They make their faces appear sad in order that people will see that they are
abstaining from food \add and will think highly of them\add*. Keep this in mind:
\add People will think highly of those people for that\add*, but\add that is the
only\add* reward those people will get! 
\v 17 Instead, \add each of\add* you, when you abstain from food, should comb your hair and wash your face
\add as usual\add*, 
\v 18 in order that other people will not notice that you are fasting\add because you will look as you always
do\add*. But \add God\add*, your Father, whom no one can see, \add will observe that you are abstaining from food.
God\add* your Father sees \add you\add* even though no one else sees
\add you\add*, and he will reward you.” 
\s Matthew 6:19-21 
\s Jesus taught that we should do deeds that please God. That will be like putting treasures in heaven.
\p
\v 19 “Do not \add selfishly\add* accumulate large quantities of money and material goods for yourselves on
\add this\add* earth, because \add the earth is where everything perishes. For
example\add*, on earth termites ruin things, and things rust, and thieves enter
\add buildings\add* and steal things. 
\v 20 Instead, do \add deeds that will please God. Your doing such deeds will be
like\add* storing treasures in heaven \f + \fr metaphor \f*. \add Nothing perishes in
heaven\add*. In heaven no termites ruin \add things\add*, nothing rusts, and thieves do not enter buildings and steal.
\v 21  \add Remember that\add* the things \add that you think are the
most\add* valuable are \add the things that\add* you will be constantly concerned about \f + \fr metaphor \f*.
\add So if you want to be storing treasures in heaven\add*, you \add need to
be\add* constantly thinking \add about God and heaven\add*, \add instead of your earthly
possessions\add*.” 
\s Matthew 6:22-23 
\s Jesus taught that we should be generous with what we possess.
\p
\v 22 “Your eyes are \add like\add* a lamp \f + \fr metaphor \f* for your body, because they enable you to see things. So if your eyes are
healthy, you are able to see everything well \f + \fr metaphor \f*. \add Similarly, if you are generous with your money and other possessions,
you will be able to know much of what God wants you to know\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f*.
\v 23 But if your eyes are bad, you are not able to see things well. And if that continues, the time will come when you will
not be able to see at all. You will be in complete darkness \f + \fr metaphor \f*.
\add Similarly, if you continue to be greedy, you will be in spiritual darkness. If all that your eyes can see and your mind
can think about involves your greedily desiring material possessions, all that you do will be
evil\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f*.” 
\s Matthew 6:24 
\s Jesus taught that we should not try to serve God and accumulate money at the same time.
\p
\v 24 “No one is able to serve two \add different\add* bosses \add at the same
time\add*. If \add he tried to do that\add*, he would hate one of them and love the other one, or he would be loyal to one of
them and despise the other one \f + \fr doublet \f*. \add Similarly\add*, you cannot
\add devote your life to\add* worshipping God and \add worshipping\add* money and material goods
\add at the same time\add*.” 
\s Matthew 6:25-34 
\s Jesus taught that we should not worry about having enough food and clothes.
\p
\v 25 “Because\add you should be concerned about what God thinks is important and not about material goods,
I\add* tell you that you should not worry about \add things that you need in order
to\add* live. \add Do not worry\add* about whether you will have
\add enough food\add* to eat, and \add things\add* to drink, or \add enough\add* clothes to wear. It is important to have
\add sufficient\add* food \add and drink\add* and clothing, but the way you conduct your lives is much more important \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*.
\v 26 Look at the birds. They do not plant \add seeds, and they do
not\add* harvest \add crops\add* and gather \add produce\add* into barns.
\add They always have food to eat because God\add*, your Father who is in heaven, provides food for them. And you are certainly
worth a lot more than birds \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*! \add So you can be assured that God will supply what you
need!\add* 
\v 27 ◄None of you can, just by worrying, \add add time to your life\add*./Can any of you, just by worrying,
\add add time to your life\add*?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* \add You cannot\add* add
\add even\add* one minute to your life! \add So you should not worry about things such as food and
clothing!\add* 
\p
\v 28 You should also not worry about \add whether you will have
enough\add* clothes \add to wear\add* \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*. Think about the way flowers
\add grow\add* in the fields. They do not work \add to earn money\add*, and they do not make their own clothes.
\v 29 But I tell you that even though \add King\add* Solomon, who
\add lived long ago\add*, \add wore very beautiful clothes\add*, his clothes were not as beautiful as one of those
\add flowers\add*. 
\v 30 God makes the wild plants very beautiful, \add but they grow\add* in the field
\add for only a short time\add*. One day they grow, and the next day they are thrown into an oven {someone
\add cuts them and\add* throws them into an oven} \add to be burned to make heat for baking bread. But you are more important
to God than wild plants are, and you live much longer\add*. So ◄God will certainly provide clothes for you
who\add live a long time but\add* trust him so little!/will not God surely very adequately clothe you,
\add who live a long time but\add* trust him so little?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* 
\v 31 Because of God's caring for you, do not worry and say, ‘Will we have anything to eat?’ or ‘Will we have anything to
drink?’ or ‘Will we have clothes to wear?’ \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* 
\v 32 Those who do not know God are always worrying about things like that. But God, your Father who is in heaven, knows that
you need all those things, \add so you should not worry about them\add*.
\v 33 Instead, the most important thing you should be concerned about is to let
\add God\add* completely direct your life, and to strive \add to
live\add* righteously. \add If you do that\add*, all the things that you
\add need\add* will be given to you {God will give you all the things
\add that you need\add*}. 
\v 34 So \add each day\add* do not be worried about what will happen to you the next day, because
\add when\add* that day \f + \fr personification \f* comes, \add you\add* will be concerned about
\add what happens during\add* that day. You will have enough to be concerned about each day.
\add So do not worry ahead of time\add*.”
