\c 9  
\s Matthew 9:1-8 
\s Jesus showed that he had power to forgive sins as well as to heal a paralyzed man.
\p
\v 1 Jesus and his disciples got into the boat. They skirted around
\add the lake\add* and went to \add Capernaum, the city where he was
living\add*. 
\v 2  \add Some men\add* brought to him a man who was paralyzed and who was lying on a sleeping pad. When Jesus perceived that
they believed \add that he could heal the paralyzed man\add*, he said to him, "Young man, be encouraged! I forgive your sins."
\v 3 Some of the men who taught the \add Jewish\add* laws said among themselves,
"\add He claims that he can forgive sins! That means that he claims to be equal with
God\add*! He is insulting God!" 
\v 4 Jesus knew what they were thinking. So he said, "You should not think evil
\add thoughts\add*, \add accusing me because I claim that I am God\add*!\f + \ft Or: Why do you think evil
\add thoughts\add*, \add saying that it is wrong for me to claim that I am
God\add*? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* 
\v 5 It would \add not\add* be risky \add for someone\add* to say
\add to this man\add*, '\add I\add* forgive your sins', \add because no one could see whether or not it really
happened\add*. But \add no one, without having the power to heal\add*, would say
\add to him\add*, '\add Get\add* up and walk!', \add because people could easily see whether it happened or
not!\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* 
\v 6  \add So I am going to do something\add* in order that you may know that
\add God\add* has authorized \add me\add*, the one who came from heaven, to forgive the sins
\add of people while I am\add* on the earth, \add as well as to heal
people\add*." Then he said to the paralyzed man, "Get up, pick up your sleeping pad, and go home!"
\v 7 And \add immediately\add* the man got up, \add picked up his sleeping
pad\add*, and went home! 
\v 8 When the crowds saw this, they were awestruck. They praised God for giving authority to a human being
\add to do\add* such \add things\add*. 
\s Matthew 9:9-13 
\s Jesus invited Matthew to go with him, and he told the Pharisees that they needed to repent.
\p
\v 9 As Jesus was going away from there, he saw me, a man named Matthew. I was sitting at a table where I collected taxes
\add for the Roman government\add*. He said to me, "Come with me
\add and become my disciple\add*!" So I got up and went with him.
\v 10  \add Then I invited\add* Jesus and his disciples to my home for a meal. While
\add they\add* were sitting and eating in my home, many tax collectors and
\add other people who were\add* {whom \add the Pharisees\add*} \add considered to be
habitual\add* sinners came unexpectedly to eat with us. 
\v 11 When the Pharisees saw \add that, they came\add* to us disciples and said,
"\add It is disgusting that\add* your teacher, \add who claims to be
righteous\add*, eats \add and associates\add* with tax collectors and
\add other\add* sinners!\f + \ft Or: Why is it that your teacher, \add who claims to be
righteous\add*, eats \add and associates\add* with tax collectors and
\add other\add* sinners? \f*" \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* 
\v 12 Jesus heard what \add they said\add*, so he told them \add this
parable\add*: "\add It is\add* people who are sick who need a \add doctor\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, not people who are well."
\add What he meant by that was that it was people who knew that they were sinners who were coming to him in order to be helped
spiritually\add*. 
\v 13 He continued by saying, "You need to learn what these words that
\add God said\add* mean: 'I want you to \add act\add* mercifully to people and not
\add just to offer\add* sacrifices.' Keep in mind that I came \add from heaven,
not\add* to invite \add people who think\add* \f + \ft irony \f* \add that they
are\add* righteous \add to turn away from their sinful lives and come to me, but to invite people who know they
are\add* sinners \add to turn from their sins and come to me\add*."
\s Matthew 9:14-17 
\s Jesus illustrated why it was not appropriate for his disciples to fast, and that living according to his new message was
better than following the old traditions like fasting. 
\p
\v 14 Later, the disciples of John \add the Baptizer\add* came to Jesus and asked him,
"We\add (exc)\add* and the Pharisees \add often\add* abstain from food
\add to show that we want to please God\add*, but your disciples do not do that.
Why\add do they not\add*?" 
\v 15  \add Jesus wanted to show them and the Pharisees that it was not appropriate for his disciples to abstain from food and
mourn while he was still with them\add*. So he \add gave them this
illustration\add*: "When the bridegroom is with \add his friends at the time of the
wedding\add*, the groom's friends certainly do not mourn, do they?\f + \ft Or: do the groom's friends mourn? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\add No, they do not mourn, because they are not sad at that time. But
when\add* the bridegroom is taken {\add someone\add* takes the groom\add \f + \ft Or: his \f*
enemies\add* take the groom} from them, they will abstain from food,
\add because then they will be sad\add*." 
\p
\v 16  \add Jesus wanted to show them that people who desire to live in accordance with his new message should not try to
continue to obey the old religious traditions like\add* \add abstaining from
food\f + \ft Or: fasting\add* \f* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. \add So he said to them\add*, "People do not sew a patch of unshrunken cloth on an old garment
\add to mend a hole\add*. If they did that, \add when they washed the
garment\add*, the patch would \add shrink\add* and tear the garment, and the hole would become bigger.
\v 17 Neither does anyone pour freshly-\add squeezed\add* grape juice into old skin bags
\add to store it\add*. If anyone did that, those skin bags would tear
\add because they would not stretch when the grape juice ferments and expands.
They\add* would be ruined, and the wine would be spilled {spill}
\add on the ground\add*. Instead, \add people\add* put new wine into new skin bags,
\add and the bags will stretch when the wine ferments\add*. As a result, both
\add the wine and the bags\add* are preserved." 
\s Matthew 9:18-26 
\s Jesus healed a woman who had constant hemorrhaging. He also caused a young girl to become alive again.
\p
\v 18 While Jesus was saying that, a leader of the Jewish meeting place came and bowed down before him
\add to show respect\add*. Then he said, "My daughter just died! But if you come and lay your hand on her, she will live
\add again\add*!" 
\v 19 So Jesus got up, and he and \add we\add* disciples went with the man.
\v 20-21 Then a woman who \add had been suffering constant vaginal\add* bleeding \f + \ft euphemism \f* for twelve years came near Jesus. She
was saying to herself, "\add I want Jesus to heal me without anyone finding out that I have this problem of
bleeding\add*. So if I \add touch him\add* or even if I just touch his garment, I will be healed
\add without anyone finding out about it\add*." So she came behind him and touched the tassel of his garment.
\v 22 Then Jesus turned around \add to see who had touched him\add*. And when he saw the woman, he said to her, "Be encouraged,
dear woman. Because you believed \f + \ft personification \f* \add that I could heal you,
I\add* have healed you." The woman was healed at that very moment.
\p
\v 23 Then Jesus \add and some of us disciples\add* came to Jairus' house. Jesus heard the flute players
\add playing funeral music\add* and the crowd \add that had gathered\add* wailing loudly
\add because the girl had died\add*. 
\v 24  \add Knowing that he would cause her to live again\add*, he said
\add to them\add*, "Go away \add and stop the funeral music and wailing\add*, because the girl is not dead! She is
\add just\add* sleeping!" \f + \ft euphemism \f* \add The people laughed at him, because they knew that she was
dead\add*. 
\v 25 But Jesus told them to get out of the house. Then he went into
\add the room where the girl was lying\add*. He took hold of her hand and she
\add became alive again and\add* got up. 
\v 26 And the\add people of that\add* whole region heard \f + \ft personification \f* about it.
\s Matthew 9:27-31 
\s Jesus healed two blind men. 
\p
\v 27 As Jesus went away from there, two blind men followed him and shouted, "Have mercy on us
\add and heal our eyes, you who are the Messiah\add*, the Descendant of
\add King\add* David!" 
\v 28 Jesus went into his own house, and then the blind men went in, too. Jesus said to them, "Do you believe that I am able
\add to heal your eyes\add*?" They said to him, "Yes, Lord!" 
\v 29 Then he touched their eyes and he said \add to them\add*, "Because you believe
\add that I can heal your eyes\add*, I am healing them \add right
now\add*!" 
\v 30 And they were able to see \f + \ft idiom \f*! Then Jesus told them sternly, "Be sure \f + \ft idiom \f* that you do not tell anybody
\add what I did for you\add*!" 
\v 31 But they went out and reported it throughout that whole region.
\s Matthew 9:32-34 
\s Jesus expelled a demon, but the Pharisees accused him of doing such things by Satan's power.
\p
\v 32 When \add Jesus and we disciples\add* left \add his house\add*, some people brought to Jesus a man who was unable to
speak because he was controlled by a demon {a demon controlled him}.
\v 33 After Jesus had expelled the demon, the man who had been unable to speak began to speak! The crowd
\add who saw this\add* marveled. They said, "Never before have \add we
seen\add* anything as \add marvelous\add* as this happen in Israel!"
\v 34 But the Pharisees said, "It is \add Satan\add*, who rules the demons, who
\add enables this man to\add* expel demons \add from people\add*."
\s Matthew 9:35-38 
\s Jesus told his disciples to pray that God would send more workers to tell his message to those who were ready to respond.
\p
\v 35 Then \add we\add* went \add with\add* Jesus through many of \f + \ft hyperbole \f* the cities and towns
\add in Galilee district. He was teaching in the synagogues\f + \ft Or: in the Jewish meeting
places \f*\add*, and preaching the good message about how God rules
\add over people's lives\add*. He also was healing the \add people who
had\add* various diseases and illnesses. 
\v 36 When he saw the crowd of people, he pitied them because they were harassed and dejected.
\add They were\add* like sheep that do not have a shepherd \f + \ft simile \f*.
\v 37 Then he gave \add this illustration\add* to us disciples: "\add The people who are ready to receive my message are like
a\add* field that is ready to be harvested {for people to harvest}. But there are only a few
\add of you who are teaching people my message\add*. 
\v 38 So pray and ask the Lord \add God\add* to send \add more\add* workers
\add who will gather people together and teach them my message, just like a landowner sends
workers\add* into his \add field to gather\add* the \f + \ft metaphor \f* harvest."
