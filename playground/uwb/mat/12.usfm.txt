\s Matthew 12:1-8 
\s Jesus showed the religious leaders that the Scriptures indicated that God permitted some people to disobey religious laws
when they needed food. He also showed them that he had the authority from God to tell people what was right to do on the
Sabbath. 
\p
\v 1 During that period of time, on a Sabbath\f + \ft Or: Jewish day of rest \f*, Jesus
\add and we\add* disciples were walking through some grain fields. And because we were hungry, we began to pick some of the
heads of grain and eat them. \add The laws of Moses permitted people to do that if they were
hungry\add*. 
\v 2 Some Pharisees saw us \add do what they considered to be work\add*. So they said to Jesus,
\add accusing him\add*, "Look! Your disciples are doing \add work\add* that is not permitted
\add in our\add* laws \f + \ft personification \f* \add for us\add* to do on our day of rest!"
\v 3  \add Jesus wanted to show them that the record in the Scriptures indicated that God permitted people to disobey certain
religious laws when they needed food\add*. \add So\add* he said to them,
"\add It is written\add* {\add Someone wrote\add*} \add in the Scriptures\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* what
\add our revered ancestor King\add* David did when he and the men with him were hungry. You have read about that,
\add but you do not think about what it implies!\f + \ft Or: so why do you not think about what it
implies\add*? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* 
\v 4 David entered the big tent \add where they worshipped\add* God
\add and asked for some food. The high priest gave him\add* the bread that had been {they had} presented
\add to God\add*. According to the laws \add of Moses\add*, only priests were permitted to eat that bread, but David and the
men who were with him ate it. And\add God did not consider that what they did was
wrong\add*! 
\v 5 Also, think about the laws that \add Moses wrote\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*. He said that
\add even though\add* the priests, \add by working\add* in the Temple on our Jewish day of rest, are not obeying the Jewish day
of rest \add laws\add*, they are not guilty. You have surely read that,
\add but you do not understand what it means\add*. 
\v 6 Note this: \add God allows men to work in\add* the Temple \add on our rest day because that work must be done. But in
addition, I\add* tell you that\add I have\add* more \add authority than the authority
of\add* the Temple. So, it is more important for you to obey my teachings than to obey your traditions about our rest day.
\v 7  \add You should think about\add* these words\add of God in the
Scriptures:\add* 'I want you to \add act\add* mercifully toward people, and not
\add just\add* offer sacrifices.' If you understood what that means, you would not condemn
\add my disciples\add*, who have done no wrong. 
\v 8  \add I want you to know that\add* I, the one who came from heaven, have
\add the\add* authority \add to determine what is right for my disciples to do
on\add* the days of rest." 
\s Matthew 12:9-14 
\s Jesus healed a man on the Sabbath. At the same time, he told the Pharisees that they were mistaken in thinking that it was
wrong to heal a person on the Sabbath. 
\p
\v 9 After Jesus left there \add that day\add*, he went into a building where we Jews worship God.
\v 10  \add He saw\add* a man with a shriveled hand there. \add The Pharisees thought that Jesus would be disobeying the
tradition about not working on the day of rest if he healed the man, so one
of\add* them asked him, "Does \add God\add* permit \add us\add* to heal
\add people\add* on our day of rest?" \add They asked that question\add* so that they might accuse him
\add if he healed someone\add* on the Sabbath\f + \ft Or: on the Jewish rest day \f*.
\v 11 He replied to them, "Would anyone among you who has \add only\add* one sheep that falls into a hole on the Sabbath\f + \ft Or: on
the Jewish rest day \f* \add just leave it there\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*? \add Certainly
not!\add* You would take hold of it and lift it out right away, \add and that would be acceptable work on our day of rest,
too\add*! 
\v 12  \add Because\add* sheep are valuable, \add their owners may work on our day of rest in order to rescue them. So,
because\add* people are more valuable than sheep, it is certainly right for us to do something
good\add by healing another person any day, including\add* our day of rest!"
\v 13 Then he said to the man, "Stretch out your \add withered\add* hand!" The man stretched it out, and it became normal like
the other hand! 
\v 14 Then the Pharisees left \add the meeting house. They were worried that the people would reject their traditions and would
accept Jesus' teaching instead. So\add* they met together to plan how they could kill him.
\s Matthew 12:15-21 
\s Jesus explained that his acting humbly when he healed people was a fulfillment of prophecy.
\p
\v 15 Because Jesus knew \add that the Pharisees were plotting to kill
him\add*, he \add took us disciples and\add* went away from there. Crowds,
\add including many sick people\add*, followed him, \add wanting him to heal
them\add*, and he healed them all. 
\v 16 But he told them firmly that they should not tell \add other people
yet\add* who he was. 
\v 17  \add By acting humbly like that\add* he fulfilled what was written by Isaiah the prophet {what Isaiah the prophet wrote}
\add long ago about the Messiah\add*. \add Isaiah wrote\add* that God said:
\q
\v 18 Take note of my servant whom I have chosen, the one whom I love and with whom I am pleased. I will put my Spirit in him,
and he will proclaim that \add God\add* will judge the non-Jews justly.
\v 19 He will not quarrel \add with people\add*, neither will he shout. He will not
\add teach with\add* a loud voice in the \add main\add* streets.
\v 20 Until he has justly judged \add the people who trust in him
and\add* has declared them not guilty, he will not destroy \add anyone who is weak
like\add* a smashed stalk \f + \ft metaphor \f*, nor will he silence \add anyone who is helpless
like\add* a smoldering \add linen\add* wick \f + \ft metaphor, doublet \f*. 
\v 21 As a result, the non-Jews will confidently expect \add that he will do great things for
them\add*. 
\s Matthew 12:22-32 
\s Jesus refuted the argument that he was expelling demons by Satan's power, and he warned that making such statements is an
unforgivable sin against the Holy Spirit. 
\p
\v 22 One day when Jesus was at home, \add some men\add* brought to
\add Jesus\add* a man \add who, because of being\add* controlled by a demon {a demon controlled him}, was blind and unable to
speak. \add Jesus\add* healed him \add by expelling the demon\add*. As a result, the
man\add began to\add* talk and \add was able to\add* see. 
\v 23 All the crowd \add who saw it\add* marveled. They began asking
\add each other\add*, "Could this man be the \add Messiah, the\add* descendant of
\add King\add* David\add , whom we have been expecting\add*?" 
\v 24 Because the Pharisees \add and the men who taught the Jewish
laws\add* heard \add that the people thought that Jesus might be the Messiah because he had expelled the
demon\add*, they said, "\add It is not God, but\add* Beelzebub, the ruler of the demons, who
enables\add this man\add* to expel demons \add from people!\add*"
\v 25 But Jesus knew what\add the Pharisees\add* were thinking \add and
saying\add*. So, \add in order to show them that what they said did not make
sense\add*, he said to them, "If \add the people in\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* one nation fight against each other,
\add they\add* will destroy their nation {their nation will be destroyed}. If
\add people who live in\add* the same city or house fight each other, they will certainly not remain
\add as one group or family\add*. 
\v 26  \add Similarly\add*, if Satan were expelling his own \add demons\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*,
\add it would be as though\add* he was fighting against himself. His kingdom would not continue!\f + \ft Or: How could his kingdom
continue? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* His rule over them would \add certainly\add* not last!
\v 27 Furthermore, if \add it is true that\add* Satan enables me to expel demons, is it also true that your disciples
\add who\add* expel demons\add do so\add* by\add Satan's\add* power \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*?
\add No\add*! So they will show you that you \add are not thinking
logically\add*. 
\v 28 But because it is God's Spirit who \add enables\add* me to expel demons,
\add that proves that the power of\add* God to rule \add people's
lives\add* has come to you. 
\p
\v 29  \add I will illustrate why I am able to expel demons\add*. A person cannot go into the house of a strong man \f + \ft metaphor \f*
\add like Satan\add* and carry off his possessions if he does not first bind the strong man.\f + \ft Or: How can someone go into the house
of a strong man ( metaphor ) \add like Satan\add* and carry off his possessions if he does not first bind the strong man? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\add But if he binds the strong man\add*, then he will be able to steal
\add the things in that man's\add* house. 
\p
\v 30  \add No one can be neutral\add*. Those who do not acknowledge
\add that the Holy Spirit enables\add* me \add to expel demons\add* are opposing me, and those who do not gather
\add people to become\add* my\add disciples\add* are causing\add those
people\add* to \f + \ft doublet \f* go away \add from me\add*. 
\p
\v 31 You \add are saying that it is not the Holy Spirit who is enabling me to expel
demons\add*. So I will say this to you: \add If\add* those who offend and slander other people in any way
are\add then sorry and ask God to forgive them, God\add* will forgive them. But people who discredit what the Holy Spirit does
will not be forgiven {\add God\add* will not forgive \add people\add* who discredit what the Holy Spirit does}.
\v 32  \add God is willing to\add* forgive people who criticize \add me\add*, the One who came from heaven. But I
\add warn you that\add* those who say evil things about what the Holy Spirit
\add does\add* will not be forgiven {\add God\add* will not forgive people who speak evil words about what the Holy Spirit
\add does\add*}. They will not be forgiven {\add He\add* will not forgive them} now, and they will never be forgiven
{\add he\add* will never forgive them}." 
\s Matthew 12:33-37 
\s Jesus said that we can judge what people are like by seeing what they do.
\p
\v 33 "Think about this: You can know whether \add a person is good and what that person says is good, in the same way that
you\add* can know whether a tree \f + \ft metaphor \f* and the fruit it produces \f + \ft metaphor \f* are good.
\add You can also know whether a person and what that person says is evil in the same way that you can
know\add* whether a tree \f + \ft metaphor \f* and its fruit \f + \ft metaphor \f* are blighted. You can know whether a tree is good by
\add seeing\add* its fruit, and similarly \add people can know the evil character of you Pharisees by listening to your
accusations against me\add*. 
\v 34  \add What\add* you \add teach harms people spiritually like
poisonous\add* snakes \add harm them physically\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*! You are not able to speak good things because you are evil \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*.
Evil people \f + \ft synecdoche \f* \add like you\add* speak what comes from all that is in their inner beings\f + \ft Or: hearts \f*.
\v 35 Good people \add speak good things. That is like\add* taking good things out of buildings where they are stored. But evil
people \add speak evil things. That is like\add* taking evil things out of buildings where they are stored.
\v 36 I tell you that on the day when God judges \f + \ft metonymy \f*, he will make people recall every useless word they have spoken,
\add and he will judge them accordingly\add*. 
\v 37  \add God\add* will \add either\add* declare that you are righteous based on the words that you have spoken, or
\add else\add* he will condemn you based on what you have said."
\s Matthew 12:38-42 
\s Jesus told the Jewish leaders that the only miracle that they would see him do would be one like God did for Jonah.
\p
\v 38 Then some of the Pharisees and men who taught the \add Jewish\add* laws responded
\add to what Jesus was teaching\add* by saying to him, "Teacher, we want to see you
\add perform\add* a miracle \add that would prove to us that God sent
you\add*." 
\v 39 Then Jesus said to them, "\add You\add* people \add have already seen me perform
miracles\add*, but you are evil, and you do not faithfully worship God \f + \ft metaphor \f*! You want
\add me to perform\add* a miracle \add that would prove to you that God sent
me\add*, but \add God will enable\add* you to see only one miracle. It will be
\add like\add* what happened to Jonah the prophet \f + \ft metaphor \f*. 
\v 40 Jonah was in the stomach of a huge fish for three days and nights
\add before God caused him to live again\add*. Similarly, for three days and nights I, the one who came from heaven, will be in
a place \add where dead people are, and then God will cause me to live
again\add*. 
\v 41 When \add God\add* judges \add all people\add*, the people who lived in Nineveh will stand
\add in front of him\add* with \add you\add* people who \add have seen me perform
miracles\add*. The \add people of Nineveh turned from their sinful ways as a result of hearing
what\add* Jonah preached. \add Jonah was important, but I\add*, who am more important than Jonah,
\add have come and preached to you, but you have not turned from your sinful ways.
So\add* when \add God\add* judges \add all people, he\add* will condemn you.
\v 42 The queen from \add Sheba, South of Israel, who lived long ago, came from a distant region in order to listen to King
Solomon teach\add* many wise things. But now \add I\add*, \add a
man\add* who \add is much\add* greater \add and wiser\add* than Solomon, am here,
\add but you have not listened to what I have told you\add*. So at the time when
\add God\add* judges \add all people\add*, the queen from \add Sheba will stand in front of him,
along\add* with you people, and will condemn you." 
\s Matthew 12:43-45 
\s Jesus taught that those who have had evil spirits expelled from them need to have their lives controlled by the Holy Spirit.
\p
\v 43 "\add Sometimes\add* when an evil spirit leaves a person, it wanders around in desolate areas, seeking
\add someone in whom it can\add* rest. If it does not find anyone,
\v 44 it says \add to itself\add*, 'I will return to the person \f + \ft metaphor \f* in whom I used to live.' So it goes back
\add and finds that the Spirit of God is not in control of that\add* person's
\add life. The person's life is like\add* a house that has been swept clean and everything put in order \f + \ft metaphor \f*,
\add but it is\add* empty. 
\v 45 Then \add this evil spirit\add* goes and gets seven other spirits that are
\add even\add* more evil, and they \add all\add* enter \add that
person\add* and \add begin\add* living there. \add So, although\add* that person's condition
\add was bad\add* before, it becomes much worse. That is what \add you\add* wicked people who
\add have heard me teach\add* will experience." 
\s Matthew 12:46-50 
\s Jesus said that those who do God's will are as important to Jesus as his own relatives are.
\p
\v 46 While Jesus was still speaking to the crowds, his mother and his
\add younger\add* brothers \add arrived\add*. They stood outside
\add the house\add*, wanting to speak with him. 
\v 47 Someone said to him, "Your mother and your \add younger\add* brothers are standing outside
\add the house\add*, wanting to talk to you." 
\v 48 Then Jesus said to the person who told him\add that\add*, "\add I will tell you something
about\add* my mother and brothers \f + \ft metaphor \f*.\add \f + \ft Or: Do you know\add* who I
\add consider to be like\add* my mother and my brothers? \f*" \f + \ft metaphor, rhetorical question \f*
\v 49 He then pointed toward \add us\add* disciples and said, "These are ones
\add whom I love as much as I love\add* my mother and my brothers \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\v 50 Those who do what \add God\add* my Father \add who is\add* in heaven wants, are
\add as dear to me\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add as\add* my brother, my sister, or my mother."
