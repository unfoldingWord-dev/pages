\c 24  
\s Matthew 24:1-2 
\s Jesus told his disciples that Jerusalem would be destroyed. 
\p
\v 1 Jesus left the Temple \add courtyard\add*. As he was walking along,
\add we\add* disciples came to him to ask him to note \add how beautiful\add* the Temple
buildings\add were\add*. 
\v 2 He said to us, “These buildings that you are looking at \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\add are wonderful, but\add* I want to tell you \add something about them. They will be completely
destroyed\add* {\add Foreign invaders will completely destroy them\add*}. Every stone
\add in these buildings\add* will be thrown down {they will throw down every stone in these buildings}. Not one stone will be
left {They will not leave one stone} on top of another stone.” 
\s Matthew 24:3-14 
\s Jesus told his disciples about the distressing things that would happen before his return.
\p
\v 3  \add Later\add*, as Jesus was sitting alone on \add the slope
of\add* Olive \add Tree\add* Hill, \add we\add* disciples went to him and asked him, “When will this happen
\add to the buildings of the Temple? Also, tell us what will happen to indicate that you are about
to\add* come again, and \add to indicate\add* that this world is ending?”
\p
\v 4 Jesus replied, “\add All that I will say is\add*, be sure that no one deceives you
\add about what will happen\add*! 
\v 5 Many \add people\add* will come and say that I sent them\f + \ft Or: that they have my authority \f* \f + \ft metonymy \f*. They will say, ‘I am the
Messiah’, and they will deceive many \add people\add*. 
\v 6 You will hear about wars \add that are close\add* and wars that are far away, but do not let that trouble you. Keep in
mind that \add God has said that\add* those things must happen. But
\add when they happen\add*, it will not mean that the end \add of the
world\add* has come! 
\v 7  \add Groups in various\add* countries will fight each other, and
\add various\add* governments \add will also fight\add* against each other. There will be famines and earthquakes in various
places. 
\v 8 These things will happen first. Then there will be other things that
\add will happen before I return. What will happen will be as painful
as\add* birth pains \f + \ft metaphor \f*. 
\p
\v 9 “At that time \add people who oppose you\add* will take you to
\add the authorities, who\add* will mistreat you and kill you. You will be hated by
\add people who live in\add* all nations \f + \ft personification \f* {\add People who live
in\add* all nations \f + \ft personification \f* will hate you} because \add you believe in me
\f + \ft metonymy \f*\add*. 
\v 10 Also, many \add people\add* will stop believing \add in me because of the way they will
suffer\add*. They will betray each other and will hate each other.
\v 11 Many will come saying that they are prophets, but they will be lying, and they will deceive many people.
\v 12 Because there will be more and more \add people\add* who will disobey
\add God's\add* laws \f + \ft personification \f*, many \add people\add* will no longer \f + \ft metaphor \f* love
\add their fellow believers\add* \f + \ft personification \f*. 
\v 13 But \add all\add* those who keep on \add believing in me\add* \f + \ft euphemism \f* to the end
\add of their lives\add* will be saved. 
\v 14 Furthermore, the good message about my ruling over people's lives will be preached in every part of the world, in order
that people of all ethnic groups may hear it. Then the end \add of the
world\add* will come.” 
\s Matthew 24:15-22 
\s Jesus told his disciples about the suffering that would come when Jerusalem was about to be destroyed.
\p
\v 15 “\add But before the world ends\add*, the disgusting person who will defile
\add the\add* holy\add Temple and cause people to abandon it will stand in the Temple. Daniel the prophet spoke and
wrote\add* about that \add long ago\add*. May everyone who reads
\add this\add* pay attention \add to the following warning from me:\add*
\v 16 When you see that happen\add in the Temple, those of you\add* who are in Judea
\add district\add* must flee to the \add higher\add* hills! 
\v 17 Those who are outside their houses must not go back into their houses to get things
\add before they flee\add*. 
\v 18 Those who are \add working\add* in a field should not turn back to get their outer clothing
\add before they flee\add*. 
\v 19 I \add feel\add* very sorry for women who will be pregnant and women who will be nursing
\add their babies\add* in those days, \add because it will be very difficult for them to run
away\add*! 
\v 20 Pray that you will not have to flee in the winter\f + \ft Or: in the rainy season \f*
\add when it will be hard to travel\add*. \add People who think that God never allows anyone to do any work
on\add* our day of rest\add will not help you as you flee, so\add* pray also that you will not have to flee on such a day,
\v 21 because people will suffer very severely \add when those things
happen\add*. People have never suffered that severely since \add God\add* created the world until now, and no one will ever
\add suffer like that again\add*. 
\v 22 If \add God had not decided to\add* shorten that time \f + \ft metonymy \f*
\add when people will suffer so much\add*, everyone \f + \ft litotes \f* would die. But
\add he has decided to\add* shorten it because \add he is concerned\add*
about\add the people\add* whom \add he\add* has chosen.” 
\s Matthew 24:23-28 
\s Jesus warned his disciples not to believe false reports about his return because everyone will see him when he comes.
\p
\v 23-24 “\add At that time\add* people will appear \add who will\add* falsely
\add say that they are\add* the Messiah or \add that they are\add* prophets. They will perform many kinds ◄of miracles\f + \ft Or: of \f*
things that ordinary people cannot do►, in order to deceive people. They will even try
\add to see\add* if \add it is\add* possible to deceive \add you people whom God
has\add* chosen. So, at that time, if someone says to you, ‘Look, here
\add is\add* the Messiah!’ or \add if someone says\add*, ‘There is the Messiah!’ do not believe it!
\v 25 Do not forget \add that\add* I have warned you about all this before
\add it happens\add*. 
\v 26 So if someone says to you, ‘Look, \add the Messiah\add* is in the desolate area!’ do not go there.
\add Likewise, if someone says to you\add*, ‘Look, he is in a secret room!’ do not believe
\add that person\add*, 
\v 27 because just like lightning flashes from the east to the west
\add and people everywhere can\add* see it \f + \ft simile \f*, when \add I\add*, the one who came from heaven, return again,
\add everyone will see me\add*. 
\v 28  \add When I return, it will be as obvious to everyone as the fact
that\add* wherever you see vultures gathering, you know that there will be an animal carcass \f + \ft metaphor \f* there. \f + \ft Or: Just like the
vultures gather together wherever there is an animal carcass, God will punish sinful people wherever they are. \f*”
\s Matthew 24:29-31 
\s Jesus told his disciples what will happen at the time of his return.
\p
\v 29 “Immediately after many people have suffered during those days,
\add the universe will become dark\add*. The sun will become dark. The moon will not shine. The stars will fall from the sky.
And the powerful \add objects\add* in the sky will be shaken. \f + \ft Or: And the spiritual beings in space will be deposed. \f*
\v 30 After that, something \add will be seen\add* {\add people will observe
something\add*} in the sky that indicates that \add I\add*, the one who came from heaven,
\add am returning to the earth\add*. Then \add unbelieving people
from\add* all ethnic groups of the earth will \add mourn because they will be
afraid\add* of \add God punishing them\add*. They will see \add me\add*, the one who came from heaven, coming on the clouds
with power and great glory \add as I return to the earth\add*. 
\v 31 I will send my angels \add to the earth\add* from everywhere in the heavens.
\add They will be\add* blowing trumpets loudly. \add Then\add* from throughout the whole earth \f + \ft doublet \f* they will gather the
people whom I have chosen.” 
\s Matthew 24:32-35 
\s Jesus told his disciples how to know when the time of his return was near.
\p
\v 32 “\add Now\add* I \add want you to\add* learn something \add from\add* this parable about
\add how\add* fig trees \add grow\add*. \add In this area\add*, when the branches
\add of a fig tree\add* become tender and its leaves begin to sprout, you know that summer is near.
\v 33 Similarly, when you see all these things that I \add have just described
happening\add*, you will know that \add the time for me to return\add* is very close \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\v 34 Keep this in mind: All of these events will happen before all the people who have observed the things that I have done
have died \f + \ft euphemism \f*. 
\v 35  \add You can be certain that these\add* things that I have told
\add you\add* about will happen. You can be more certain of that than you can be certain that the earth and sky \f + \ft litotes \f* will
continue to exist.” 
\s Matthew 24:36-44 
\s Jesus told his disciples to be ready because they do not know the time of his return.
\p
\v 36 “But neither I, nor any other person, nor any angel in heaven, knows either the day or the hour
\add when the things that I have told you about will happen\add*. Only
\add God, my\add* Father, \add knows\add*. 
\v 37-39 It will be like what happened when Noah lived. Until the flood came,
\add the people\add* did not know that \add anything bad would happen\add* to them. Before the flood waters covered the earth,
\add the people\add* were eating and drinking \add as usual\add*. Some men were marrying women and
\add some parents\add* were giving their daughters to men to marry them. They were doing all this until the day that Noah
\add and his family\add* entered the big boat. And then the flood came and drowned all
\add those who were not in the boat\add*. Similarly, \add the unbelieving people will not
know\add* when \add I, the one who came from heaven\add*, will return,
\add and they will not\add* be \add expecting me\add*. 
\v 40 When I \add return\add*, I \add will not take all people up to heaven. I will take only those who trust in me. For
example\add*, two \add people\add* will be in the fields. One of them will be taken
{\add I\add* will take one of them} up \add to heaven\add* and the other
\add person\add* will be left {and I will leave the other \add person\add*}
\add here to be punished\add*. 
\v 41  \add Similarly\add*, two \add women\add* will be at the mill grinding grain. One of them will be taken up
\add to heaven\add* and the other will be left. 
\v 42 So, because you do not know what day \add I\add*, your Lord, will return
\add to the earth\add*, you need to be ready \add for me to return at any
time\add*. 
\v 43 You know that if the owners of a house knew at what time in the night thieves would come, they would be awake and prevent
the thieves from breaking into their houses. Similarly I \add will come just like unexpectedly as a
thief\add*. 
\v 44 So you need to be ready \add for my return\add*, because \add I\add*, the one who came from heaven, will return
\add to the earth\add* at a time when you do not expect \add me to
come\add*.” 
\s Matthew 24:45-51 
\s Jesus told a parable to warn his disciples not to act wickedly, thinking that he would not return soon.
\p
\v 45 “Think about what every faithful and wise servant is like \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*. The house owner appoints one servant to supervise the
other servants. He tells him to give them food at the proper times.
\add Then he leaves on a long trip\add*. 
\v 46 If the servant is doing that \add work\add* when the house owner
returns\add , the house owner\add* will be very pleased with him.
\v 47 Think about this: The house owner will appoint \add that one
servant\add* to be the supervisor of all his possessions. 
\v 48 But a wicked servant might say to himself, ‘The owner \add has been
away\add* for a long time, \add so he probably\add* will not return
soon\add and find out what I am doing.’\add* 
\v 49  \add So he\add* will begin to beat the other servants and eat and drink with those who are drunk.
\v 50  \add Then\add* the house owner will come back at a time when the servant does not expect him \f + \ft doublet \f*.
\v 51 He will punish that servant severely \f + \ft hyperbole \f*, \f + \ft Or: cut that servant into two pieces \f* and he will put him where the
hypocrites\f + \ft Or: the ones who only pretended to be good \f* are put. In that place the people cry and grind their teeth
\add because they suffer very much\add*.”
