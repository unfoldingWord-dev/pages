\s Matthew 8:1-4 
\s Jesus healed a leper and made it possible for him to associate with people again.
\p
\v 1 When Jesus went down from the hillside, large crowds followed him.
\v 2  \add After he left the crowds\add*, a man who had \add the skin disease
called\add* leprosy unexpectedly came and knelt before him. He said
\add to Jesus\add*, “Lord/Sir, \add please heal me, because I know\add* you are able to heal me if you are willing to.”
\v 3 Then Jesus, \add disregarding the religious law that forbade people to come close to
lepers\add*, stretched out his hand and touched the man. He said
\add to him\add*, “I am willing to \add heal you\add*, and I heal you
\add now\add*!” Immediately the man was healed from his leprosy {he was no longer a leper}.
\v 4 Then Jesus said to him, “Go and show yourself to a \add nearby\add* priest
\add so that he can examine you and verify that you no longer have
leprosy\add*. \add Then\add*, after he tells \add the local people\add*, they will
know\add that you no longer have leprosy\add*, \add and you will be able to associate with them
again\add*. Make sure that \add now\add* you do not report \add about my healing
you\add* to anyone \add other than the priest\add*. Then go \add to the Temple in Jerusalem and give the priest the offering
that Moses commanded that people who have been healed from leprosy should offer as a sacrifice to
God\add*.” 
\s Matthew 8:5-13 
\s Jesus healed from a distance a Roman officer's servant because the officer trusted in him.
\p
\v 5 When Jesus went to Capernaum \add city\add*, a \add Roman\add* officer who commanded one hundred soldiers came to him. He
begged Jesus \add to help him\add*. 
\v 6 He said \add to him\add*, “Sir, my servant is lying \add in
bed\add* at home and is paralyzed, and he has severe pain.” 
\v 7 Jesus said \add to him\add*, “I will go \add to your house\add* and heal him.”
\v 8 But the officer said \add to him\add*, “Lord/Sir, \add do not bother to go. I am a
non-Jew\add*, so I am not worthy for you, \add a Jew\add*, to come into my house \f + \fk metonymy \f*
\add and associate with me\add*. Instead, \add just\add* say \add that\add* my
servant\add is healed\add*, and he will be healed. 
\v 9 I \add believe this\add* because, as for me, I am a man under the authority of others, and I also have soldiers under my
authority. When I say to one of them ‘Go!’ he goes. When I say to another ‘Come!’ he comes. When I say to my slave, ‘Do this!’
he does it. \add And I believe that you speak with a similar kind of
authority\add*.” 
\v 10 When Jesus heard this, he marveled. He said to the crowd that was walking with him, “Listen to this: I have never before
found anyone who has as firm a faith \add in me as this non-Jewish man
has\add*. Not even in Israel, \add where I would expect people to believe in
me\add*, have I found anyone who has the kind of faith in me that he has!
\v 11 I tell you truly that many \add other non-Jewish people\add* who
\add will believe in me like this Roman officer\add* will come from
\add distant countries, including\add* those \add far\add* to the east and far to the west \f + \fk synecdoche \f*, and they will sit down to eat
with \f + \fk metonymy \f* Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in heaven, where God rules.
\v 12 But\add the Jews\add* \f + \fk idiom \f* \add who should have allowed\add* God to rule over them will be sent to
\add hell, where there is\add* total darkness. And as a result, they will weep
\add because of their suffering\add* and will grind their teeth \add because they will have severe
pain\add* \f + \fk metonymy \f*.” 
\v 13 Then Jesus said to the officer, “Go \add home\add*. What you believed
\add would happen\add*, \add that I would heal your servant from a
distance\add*, will happen.” \add Then the officer went home and found out
that\add* his servant became well at the exact time \add that Jesus told him that he would heal
him\add*. 
\s Matthew 8:14-15 
\s Jesus healed Peter's mother-in-law. 
\p
\v 14 When Jesus \add and some of his disciples\add* went to the home of Peter, Jesus saw Peter's mother-in-law. She was lying
on a bed because she had a fever. 
\v 15 He touched her hand, and as a result, \add immediately\add* she no longer had a fever \f + \fk personification \f*. Then she got up and served
them \add some food\add*. 
\s Matthew 8:16-17 
\s Jesus healed many sick people and expelled demons from other people.
\p
\v 16 That evening \add when\add* ◄\add the Sabbath/the Jewish rest
day\add*► \add ended and restrictions about traveling ended\add*, many people who were controlled by demons {whom demons
controlled} \add and people who were sick\add* \f + \fk metonymy \f* \add were\add* brought to Jesus. He caused the demons to leave just by
speaking to them, and he healed all the people who were sick. 
\v 17 By doing this he fulfilled the words that had been said by the prophet Isaiah {that the prophet Isaiah had said}
\add about the Messiah\add*: ‘He healed people who had sicknesses and he cured them of their diseases.’ \f + \fk doublet \f*
\s Matthew 8:18-22 
\s Jesus told a man what to expect if he went with Jesus. He told another man to follow Jesus immediately, not to wait until
later. 
\p
\v 18 Jesus saw the crowd around him, but\add he needed to rest\add*. So he told
\add his disciples to take him by boat\add* to the other side \add of the
lake\add*. 
\v 19  \add As they were walking toward the boat\add*, a man who taught the
\add Jewish\add* laws came to him and said, “Teacher, I will go with you wherever you go.”
\v 20  \add In order that the man might know what he could expect if he went with
him\add*, Jesus said to him, “Foxes have holes \add in the ground in which to
live\add*, and birds have nests, but \add even though I\add* am the one who came from heaven, I do not have a home where I can
sleep \f + \fk metonymy \f*.” 
\v 21 Another man who was one of Jesus' disciples said to him, “Sir/Lord, permit me first to go
\add home. After\add* my father \add dies I will\add* bury him, \add and then I will come with
you\add*.” 
\v 22 But Jesus said to him, “Come with me \add now\add*. \add God considers that people who do not have eternal life
are\add* dead \f + \fk metaphor \f*. Let those people \add do the work of\add* burying people who die.”
\s Matthew 8:23-27 
\s The disciples were amazed when Jesus calmed a storm on the lake.
\p
\v 23 Then Jesus got into the boat. The disciples also got \add in,
and\add* they\add started sailing around Lake Galilee\add*. 
\v 24 Suddenly strong winds blew on the lake, and very high waves were splashing into the boat and filling it. But Jesus was
sleeping. 
\v 25 They went and woke him up, and said \add to him\add*, “Sir/Lord, rescue
\add us!\add* We are about to drown!” 
\v 26 He said \add to them\add*, “◄You should not be terrified!/Why are you terrified?► \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* I
\add am disappointed that in spite of all you have seen me do\add*, ◄you do not believe very much
\add that I can rescue you./\add*do you not believe \add that I can rescue
you\add*?► \f + \fk rhetorical question \f*” Then he got up and rebuked the wind and told the waves to calm down. And
\add the wind stopped blowing and the lake\add* became calm. 
\v 27  \add As a result\add*, they were amazed, and they said \add to one
another\add*, “This man is certainly an \add extraordinary\add* person \f + \fk rhetorical question \f*!
\add All things are under his control!\add* Even the winds and the waves obey him \f + \fk personification \f*!”
\s Matthew 8:28-34 
\s Jesus expelled some demons from two men. 
\p
\v 28 When they came to the \add east\add* side \add of the lake\add*, they arrived in the region where the Gadarenes
\add lived\add*. \add Jesus got out of the boat and began walking on the road.
Then\add* two men who were controlled by demons {whom demons controlled} came out of the burial caves
\add where they were living\add*. Because they were extremely violent
\add and attacked people\add*, no one dared to travel on the road
\add near where they were living\add*. 
\v 29 Suddenly they shouted \add to Jesus\add*, “You are the Son of God!
\add Because\add* you have nothing in common with us [IDM, RHQ],
\add leave us alone\add*! Have you come here \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* to torture us before the time \f + \fk metonymy \f*
\add God has appointed to punish us\add*?” 
\v 30 There was a large herd of pigs ◄grazing/rooting for food► not far away.
\v 31 So the demons begged Jesus, saying, “You are going to cast us out of the men, so send us into the herd of pigs!”
\v 32 Jesus said \add to them\add*, “\add If that is what you want\add*, go!” So the demons left
\add the men\add* and entered the pigs. Suddenly the whole herd \add of
pigs\add* rushed down the steep bank into the lake and drowned. 
\v 33 The men who were tending the pigs \add became afraid and\add* ran into the town and reported everything
\add that had happened\add*, including what had happened to the two men who had been controlled by demons {whom demons had
controlled}. 
\v 34 Then \add it seemed as if\add* all \add the people\add* \f + \fk hyperbole \f*
\add who lived in\add* that town \f + \fk metonymy \f* went to meet Jesus. When they saw him
\add and the two men who had been controlled by the demons\add*, they begged Jesus to leave their region
\add because they thought that he would destroy more things than just the
pigs\add* \f + \ft (OR, \add because they realized he must be very powerful\add*) \f*.
