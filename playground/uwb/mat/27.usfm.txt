\s Matthew 27:1-2 
\s The Jewish religious leaders took Jesus to the Roman governor.
\p
\v 1 Very early the next morning all the chief priests and Jewish elders decided how
\add to arrange for the Romans\add* to execute Jesus. 
\v 2 They tied his hands and took him to Pilate, the \add Roman\add* governor.
\s Matthew 27:3-10 
\s After Judas returned the money and hanged himself, the Jewish leaders bought a field with the money, in fulfillment of
prophecy. 
\p
\v 3 When Judas, the one who had ◄betrayed\f + \ft Or: enabled \f* Jesus' enemies to seize► him, realized that they had decided to have Jesus
executed, he was very sorry \add about what he had done\add*. He took the thirty coins back to the chief priests and elders.
\v 4 He said, “I have sinned. I have ◄betrayed\f + \ft Or: enabled \f* you to seize► a man who ◄is innocent\f + \ft Or: has \f* not done anything wrong►.” They
replied, “◄That means nothing to us!\f + \ft Or: What \f* does that mean to us?► \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* That is your problem!”
\v 5 So Judas \add took\add* the money \add and\add* threw it inside the Temple. Then he went away and hanged himself.
\p
\v 6  \add Later\add* the high priests \add found\add* the coins. They picked them up and said, “This is money that we
paid\add to have a man killed\add* \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f*, and our law does not allow\add such
money\add* to be put {us to put \add such money\add*} into the \add Temple
treasury\add*.” 
\v 7 So they decided to use that money to buy the field where clay was dug for making pots {men dug ground for making pots}.
\add They made that field\add* a place where they buried strangers
\add who died in Jerusalem\add*. 
\v 8 That is why that place is still called {why they still call that place} ‘The field of blood.’
\v 9  \add By buying that field\add*, they fulfilled these words that the prophet Jeremiah wrote
\add long ago\add*: 
\p They took the thirty silver coins; That was what the leaders of Israel decided
\add that he was worth\add*; 
\v 10 and with that money they bought the field where clay was dug for potters. They did that as the Lord had commanded me.
\s Matthew 27:11-26 
\s Jesus was put on trial before the governor. 
\p
\v 11 Jesus stood in front of the governor. The governor asked him, “Do you
\add claim to be\add* the king of the Jews?” Jesus replied, “\add It
is\add* as you have \add just\add* said.” 
\p
\v 12 When he was accused by the chief priests and elders {When the chief priests and elders accused him} about various things,
he did not answer. 
\v 13 So Pilate said to him, “You hear how many things they are saying to accuse you;
\add are you not going to reply\add*?” 
\v 14 But \add even though he was not guilty\add*, Jesus did not say anything. He did not reply to any of the things about
which they were accusing him. As a result, the governor was very surprised.
\p
\v 15 It was the governor's custom \add each year\add* during the
\add Passover\add* celebration to release \add one person who was in
prison\add*. \add He released\add* whatever prisoner the people wanted.
\v 16 At that time there was \add in Jerusalem\add* a well-known prisoner whose name was Barabbas.
\v 17 So when the crowd gathered, Pilate asked them, “Which \add prisoner\add* would you like me to release for you: Barabbas,
or Jesus, whom \add some of you\add* claim to be the Messiah?” 
\v 18  \add He asked that question\add* because he realized that the chief priests
\add wanted to have Jesus executed\add*. They had brought Jesus to him
\add only\add* because they were jealous of Jesus. \add And Pilate thought that the crowd would prefer that he release
Jesus\add*. 
\p
\v 19 While Pilate was sitting on the platform \add where he made\add* judicial
\add decisions\add*, his wife sent him \add this message\add*: “Early this morning I had a bad dream because of that man. So do
not condemn that righteous man!” 
\p
\v 20 But the chief priests and elders persuaded the crowd to ask
\add Pilate to\add* release Barabbas, and to \add order\add* that Jesus be executed
{that\add his soldiers\add* execute Jesus}. 
\v 21 So when the governor asked them, “Which of the two men do you want me to release for you?” They replied, “Barabbas!”
\v 22 Pilate, \add very astonished\add*, asked, “So what shall I do with Jesus who
\add some of you\add* say is the Messiah?” They all answered, “\add Command
that\add* he be crucified! {\add Command your soldiers\add* ◄to crucify him\f + \ft Or: to \f* nail him to a cross►}!”
\v 23 Pilate replied, “Why? What crime has he committed?” But they shouted even louder,
“\add Have\add* him crucified {\add Command that your soldiers\add* crucify him}!”
\p
\v 24 Pilate realized that he was accomplishing nothing. He saw that instead, the people were starting to riot. So he took
\add a basin of\add* water and washed his hands as the crowd was watching. He said,
“\add By washing my hands I am showing you that\add* if this man dies \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f*, it is
\add your\add* fault, \add not mine\add*!” 
\v 25 And all the people answered, “The guilt for causing him to die \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* will be on us, and it will be on our children, too!”
\v 26 Then he \add ordered the soldiers to\add* release Barabbas for them. But he
\add ordered that his soldiers\add* whip Jesus. And then he turned Jesus over to the soldiers for them ◄to nail Jesus to a
cross\f + \ft Or: to \f* crucify him►. 
\s Matthew 27:27-31 
\s The soldiers made fun of Jesus before taking him to be crucified.
\p
\v 27 Then the governor's soldiers took Jesus into the government headquarters. The whole ◄cohort\f + \ft Or: group \f* of soldiers► gathered
around him. 
\v 28 They pulled off \add his clothes\add*, and \add pretending he was a king,
they\add* put a purple robe on him. 
\v 29 They \add took some branches with\add* thorns and wove them to make a crown and put it on his head. They put in his right
hand a reed \add like a staff that a king would hold\add*. Then they knelt in front of him and made fun of him, saying, “Hooray
for the king of the Jews \\f + \\ft irony \\f*!” 
\v 30 They kept spitting on him. They took the staff and kept striking him on the head with it.
\v 31 When they had finished ridiculing him, they pulled off the robe and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him away to
\add the place where they\add* would nail him to a cross. 
\s Matthew 27:32-44 
\s Jesus was crucified, along with two bandits. 
\p
\v 32  \add After Jesus carried his cross\add* a short distance,
\add the soldiers\add* saw a man named Simon, \add who was\add* from Cyrene
\add city\add*. They forced him to carry the cross for Jesus. 
\v 33 They came to a place called Golgotha. That name means ‘the
place\add like\add* a skull.’ 
\v 34 When \add they got there\add*, they mixed with wine something that tasted very bitter. They gave it to
\add Jesus\add* to drink \add so that he would not feel so much pain when they nailed him on the
cross\add*. But when he tasted it, he refused to drink it. \add Some soldiers took his
clothes\add*. 
\v 35 Then they nailed him to the cross. Afterwards, they divided his clothes among themselves by gambling with something like
dice \add to decide which piece of clothing each one would get\add*.
\v 36 Then the soldiers sat down there to guard him, \add to prevent anyone from trying to rescue
him\add*. 
\v 37 They fastened \add to the cross\add* above Jesus' head a \add sign on which had
been\add* {\add they had\add*} written why \add they\add* were nailing him to the cross.
\add But all\add* it said was, ‘This is Jesus, the King of the Jews.’
\v 38 Two bandits were also nailed {They also nailed two bandits} on crosses. One was nailed to a cross on the right side
\add of Jesus\add* and one to a cross on the left side. 
\v 39 The people who were passing by insulted him by shaking their heads
\add as if he were an evil man\add*. 
\v 40 They said, “You \add said you\add* would destroy the Temple, and then you would build it again within three days!
\add So if you could do that\add*, you \add should be able to\add* save yourself! If you are the man who is also God \f + \ft (OR, If
you are the Son of God), come down from the cross!” 
\p
\v 41 Similarly, the chief priests, the men who taught the \add Jewish\add* laws and the elders made fun of him.
\add Various ones of them\add* said things like, 
\v 42 “He \add claims that he\add* saved others \\f + \\ft irony \\f* \add from their
sicknesses\add*, but he cannot help himself!” “He \add says that
he\add* is \\f + \\ft irony \\f* the King of Israel. So he should come down from the cross. Then we would believe him!”
\v 43 “He \add says that he\add* trusts in God, and that he is the man who is also God. So if God is pleased with him, God
should rescue him now!” 
\v 44 And the \add two\add* bandits who had been crucified with him also insulted him, saying similar things.
\s Matthew 27:45-56 
\s When Jesus died at about three o'clock, several unusual events occurred.
\p
\v 45 At noon it became dark over the whole land. \add It stayed
dark\add* until three o'clock \add in the afternoon\add*. 
\v 46 At about three o'clock Jesus shouted loudly, “Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?” That means, ‘My God, my God, why have you
deserted me?’ 
\v 47 When some of the people standing there heard \add the word ‘Eli’, misunderstanding
it\add*, they said, “He is calling for \add the prophet\add* Elijah!”
\v 48 Immediately one of them ran and got a sponge. He filled it with sour wine. Then he put the sponge on
\add the tip of\add* a reed and \add held it up in order that Jesus\add* could suck out
\add the wine that was in it\add*. 
\v 49 But the other \add people there\add* said, “Wait! Let's see if Elijah comes to save him!”
\v 50 Then after Jesus shouted out loudly again, he died \\f + \\ft euphemism \\f*, giving his spirit over
\add to God\add*. 
\v 51 At that moment the \add heavy thick\add* curtain \add that closed off the most holy
place\add* in the Temple split into two pieces from top to bottom.
\add That signified that ordinary people could now go into the presence of
God\add*. The earth shook, and \add some large\add* rocks split open.
\v 52  \add Some\add* tombs opened up, and the bodies of many godly people who had died became alive again.
\v 53 They came out of the tombs, and after Jesus became alive again, they went into Jerusalem and appeared to many people
\add there\add*. 
\p
\v 54 The officer who supervised the soldiers \add who nailed Jesus to the cross was standing
nearby\add*. His soldiers who had been on guard \add so that no one would
rescue\add* Jesus \add were also there\add*. When they \add felt\add* the earthquake and saw all the
\add other\add* things that happened, they were terrified. They exclaimed, “Truly he was both man and God! (OR, a Son of God) \f*.”
\p
\v 55 Many women were there, watching from a distance. They were women who had accompanied Jesus from Galilee
\add district\add* in order to provide the things he needed. 
\v 56 Among these women were Mary from Magdala \add town\add*, \add another\add* Mary who was the mother of James and Joseph,
and the mother of James and John. 
\s Matthew 27:57-61 
\s Jesus was buried. 
\p
\v 57 When it was \add almost\add* evening, a rich man named Joseph
came\add there\add*. He was from Arimathea \add town\add*. He also was a disciple of Jesus.
\v 58 He then went to Pilate and asked Pilate to \add allow him to
take\add* the body of Jesus \add and bury it\add*. Pilate ordered that
\add he\add* be allowed to {\add his soldiers\add* let \add Joseph\add*} take
\add the body\add*. 
\v 59 So Joseph \add and others\add* took the body and wrapped it in a clean white cloth.
\v 60 Then they placed it in Joseph's own new tomb that had been dug out of the rock
\add cliff\add*. They rolled a huge \add circular flat\add* stone in front of the entrance to the tomb. Then they left.
\v 61 Mary from Magdala \add town\add* and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb,
\add watching\add*. 
\s Matthew 27:62-66 
\s The religious leaders arranged for Jesus' tomb to be sealed and guarded.
\p
\v 62 The next day was Saturday, the Jewish day of rest. The chief priests and
\add some of\add* the Pharisees went to Pilate. 
\v 63 They said, “Sir, we remember that while that deceiver was still alive, he said, ‘Three days after I
\add die I\add* will become alive again.’ 
\v 64 So we ask you to order that the tomb be guarded {that \add soldiers\add* guard the tomb} for three days. If you do not do
that, his disciples may come and steal the body. Then they will tell people that he has risen from the dead. If they deceive
\add people by saying that\add*, it will be worse than the way he deceived people before
\add by saying that he was the Messiah\add*.” 
\v 65 Pilate replied, “You \add can\add* take some soldiers. Go to the tomb and make it as secure as you know how.”
\v 66 So they went and made the tomb secure by \add fastening a cord
from\add* the stone \add that was in front of the entrance to the rock cliff on each
side\add* and sealing it. They also \add left some soldiers there
to\add* guard \add the tomb\add*.
