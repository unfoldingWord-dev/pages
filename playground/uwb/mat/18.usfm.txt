\c 18  
\s Matthew 18:1-5 
\s Jesus showed that being great in God's sight means being as humble as a child.
\p
\v 1 About that time we disciples approached Jesus and said, "Who
\add among us will be\add* the most important when God [MTY\f + \ft Or: EUP \f*]
\add makes you\add* king?" 
\v 2 Jesus called a child to come, and he placed that child in our midst.
\v 3 He said, "Think about this: If you\add \f + \ft plural \f*\add* do not change
\add the way you\f + \ft plural \f* think\add* and become \add as humble\add* as little children,
you\add \f + \ft plural \f*\add* will surely not go to the place where God [MTY\f + \ft Or: EUP \f*] rules.
\v 4 The people who become as humble as this child \add or any child\add* is, will be the most important people among those
over whom God rules. 
\v 5 Also, when those who, \add because they love\add* me, welcome
\add a\add* child like this one, \add God considers\add* that they are welcoming me."
\s Matthew 18:6-9 
\s Jesus taught that we need to take severe measures to keep us from sinning when we are tempted.
\p
\v 6 "If you cause someone who believes in me to sin, \add even if it is someone who is socially unimportant
like\add* this little child, \add God will severely punish you\add*. If a heavy stone were fastened around your neck and you
were thrown into the deep waters of the sea, \add people would consider that you had been severely punished. But God will
punish\add* you more severely \add than that if you cause someone to
sin\add*! 
\v 7 It will be terrible for those \f + \ft metonymy \f* who cause others to stop believing in me.
\add God will punish them eternally\add*. It is inevitable that there will be
\add those who\add* cause others to stop believing in me. But it will be horrible for everyone who does that.
\v 8 So, if you \add are wanting to use\add* one of your hands or feet to sin,
\add stop using that hand or foot! Even if you have to\add* cut it off
\add to avoid sinning, do it\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*! It is good\add that you not sin
and\add* go where you will live \add with God eternally, even though while you are still here on
earth\add* you are maimed or lame and do not have a hand or a foot. But it is not good that you continue to have your two hands
and two feet \add and do\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add the sinful things you want to, and as a
result\add*, you are thrown into \add hell\add*, where there is eternal fire burning.
\v 9 If what you see you \add makes you want\add* to sin, \add stop looking at those things! Even if you have
to\add* gouge out one of your eyes and throw it away \add to avoid sinning, do
it\add* \f + \ft hyperbole \f*! It is good\add that you not sin and\add* go where you will live
\add with God eternally, even though while you are still here on
earth\add* you have only one eye. But it is not good that you continue to have your two eyes
\add and do the sinful things you want to, and as a result\add*, you are thrown {God throws you} into hell where there is
eternal fire burning." 
\s Matthew 18:10-14 
\s Jesus taught that God is deeply concerned if even one person goes astray from him.
\p
\v 10 "Make an effort that you\add \f + \ft plural \f*\add* do not despise \add even\add* one of these children. I tell
you\add \f + \ft plural \f*\add* truly that \add since\add* the angels \add live\add* in heaven
\add in the presence of\add* my Father, \add they will report to him if you mistreat the
children\add*. 
\v 12 What do you\add \f + \ft plural \f*\add* think \add you would do in the following
situation\add*? If you had one hundred sheep and one of them got lost, you would surely leave the ninety-nine sheep
\add that are\add* on the hill and go and search for the lost one \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*, would you not?
\v 13 If you found it, I affirm to you\add \f + \ft plural \f*\add* that you would rejoice very much. You would be happy that ninety-nine
sheep did not stray away, but you would rejoice even more \add because you had
found\add* the sheep that had strayed away. 
\v 14 In the same way \add that the shepherd does not want one of\add* his
\add sheep to stray away\add*, so \add God\add*, your Father in heaven, does not want
\add even\add* one of these children to go to hell." 
\s Matthew 18:15-20 
\s Jesus taught about what we should do if someone sins against us and about agreeing when we pray.
\p
\v 15 "If a fellow believer sins \add against you\add*, go \add to
him\add*, and when you two are alone, reprove him \add for sinning against
you\add*. If that person listens to you \add and feels sorry that he has sinned against
you\add*, you will have restored \add your friendship with\add* that person.
\v 16 If that person will not listen to you \add nor feel sorry that he has sinned against
you\add*, go get one or two other people \add who will listen to what you both have to
say\add*. Have them go with you so that \add what is written\add*
{\add Moses wrote\add*} \add in the Scriptures might happen:\add*
'\add When one person accuses another in some matter\add*, it should be confirmed by
\add at least\add* two or three people {\add at least\add* two or three people should confirm it}
\add before that person can be declared\add* guilty {\add before they declare that person
guilty\add*}.' 
\v 17 If the one who has sinned against you will not listen to them
\add or does not feel sorry that he has sinned against you\add*, tell that to the congregation
\add so that they can rebuke him\add*. If that person will not listen to the congregation
\add or feel sorry that he has sinned against you, exclude him from being a member of your congregation, just
like\add* you \add would exclude\add* pagans, tax collectors, \add and others who do not believe in God and sin
greatly\add*. 
\v 18 Keep this in mind: Whatever you decide on earth \add about
punishing\add* or \add not punishing a member of your congregation\add* is what has also been decided by
\add God\add* in heaven {what \add God\add* in heaven has also decided}.
\v 19 Also note this: If \add at least\add* two of you \add who live\add* here on earth agree together about whatever you ask
\add God\add* for \f + \ft doublet \f*, \add God\add*, my Father \add who is\add* in heaven, will give you what you ask for.
\v 20  \add This is true\add*, because wherever \add at least\add* two or three of you assemble because you believe in me
\f + \ft metonymy \f*, I am \add spiritually\add* present with you. I \add will hear what you ask for and I will ask God to do it for
you\add*." 
\s Matthew 18:21-35 
\s Jesus told a parable to illustrate the need for forgiving others.
\p
\v 21 Then Peter approached \add Jesus\add* and said to him, "How many times must I forgive a fellow believer who
\add keeps on\add* sinning against me? \add If he keeps asking me to forgive him, must I forgive
him\add* as many as seven times?" 
\v 22 Jesus said to him, "I tell you \add that the number of\add* times
\add you must forgive someone is\add* not just up to seven, but \add you
must\add* \add forgive him\add* 77 times\f + \ft Or: never stop forgiving him \f*.
\v 23  \add In order to illustrate\add* why \add you should do this\add*, I
\add will tell you a story in which\add* God [MTY\f + \ft Or: EUP \f*], \add who cares
for\add* the people whose lives he rules over, is compared {I compare God,
\add who cares for\add* the people whose lives he rules over} to a king
\add and his officials\add*. That king told \add some of his servants that he
wanted\add* his officials to pay what they owed him. 
\v 24  \add So those officials were brought to the king to\add* settle
\add their accounts with him\add*. \add One of the officials who were
brought\add* owed the king several million dollars. 
\v 25 But because he did not have \add enough money\add* to pay \add what he
owed\add*, the king demanded that he, his wife, his children and all he possessed be sold
\add to someone else and that the king\add* be repaid \add with\add* {receive}
\add the money that was paid for them\add*. 
\v 26 Then that official, \add knowing that he did not have the money to pay that huge
debt\add*, fell on his knees \add in front of the king\add* and he begged him saying, 'Be patient with me, and I will pay you
all of it, \add eventually\add*.' 
\v 27 The king, \add knowing that the official could never pay all that huge
debt\add*, felt sorry for him. So he canceled his debt and released him.
\v 28 Then this official went to another one of the king's officials who owed him a bit less than a year's wages. He grabbed
him \add by the throat\add*, started choking him, and said to him, 'Pay back what you owe
\add me\add*!' 
\v 29 That official fell on his knees and begged him saying, 'Be patient with me, and I will pay you all of it,
\add eventually\add*.' 
\v 30 But this official kept refusing \add to cancel that small debt that the man owed
him\add*. Instead, he \add caused that official to be\add* put in prison
\add and to stay there\add* until he could pay back all the money that he owed him.
\v 31 When the other officials \add of the king\add* learned that this had happened, they felt very distressed. So they went to
the king and reported in detail what had happened. 
\v 32 Then the king summoned the official \add who had owed him several million
dollars\add*. He said to him, 'You wicked servant! I canceled that huge debt
\add that you owed me\add* because you begged me \add to do so\add*!
\v 33 You should have been merciful \add and canceled your fellow official's
debt\add*, just like I was merciful to you \add and canceled your
debt\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*!' 
\v 34 The king was very angry. He handed this official over to some jailers who would torture him severely until he paid all of
the debt that he owed." 
\v 35  \add Then Jesus continued by saying\add*, "That is what my Father in heaven will do to you if you do not
\add feel merciful and\add* sincerely forgive a fellow believer \add who sins against
you\add*."
