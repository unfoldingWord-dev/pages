\c 25  
\s Matthew 22:1-13 
\s Jesus taught in a parable that his disciples should always be ready for his return.
\p
\v 1  \add Jesus continued by saying, "I will tell you something else about the time when I return
from\add* heaven as king \f + \ft metaphor \f*. \add What will happen to many people who say that they know me will
be\add* like \add what happened to\add* ten virgins who took their lanterns and went to the place where they would meet a
bridegroom \add and go to his wedding celebration\add*. 
\v 2 Five of the virgins were foolish and five of them were wise.
\v 3 The \add virgins\add* who were foolish took their lanterns, but they did not take any
\add extra olive\add* oil \add for\add* the lantern\add s\add*. 
\v 4 But the \add virgins\add* who were wise took oil in their flasks as well as in their lanterns.
\v 5 The bridegroom was delayed, \add and it became late in the night\add*. So all the virgins became sleepy and fell asleep.
\v 6 In the middle of the night someone \add woke them up by\add* shouting, 'Hey! The bridegroom
\add is arriving\add*! Go outside and meet him!' 
\v 7 So all the virgins got up and trimmed their lantern wicks\add so that they would burn
properly\add*. 
\v 8 The foolish virgins said to the wise ones, 'Give us some of
your\add olive\add* oil, because our lanterns are about to go out!'
\v 9 The wise virgins replied, '\add No, because\add* there might not be enough oil for our lanterns and for yours. Go to a
store and buy some for yourselves!' 
\v 10 But while \add the foolish virgins\add* were going to buy \add some
oil\add*, the bridegroom arrived. So the \add wise virgins\add*, who were ready, went with him to the wedding hall
\add where the bride was waiting\add*. Then the door was closed {someone closed the door
\add of that hall\add*}. 
\v 11 Later, the rest of the virgins came \add to the hall\add* and they called
\add to the bridegroom\add*, 'Sir, open \add the door\add* for us!'
\v 12 But he said \add to them\add*, 'The truth is that I do not know you, so I
\add will not open the door for you\add*!'" 
\v 13  \add Then Jesus continued by saying\add*, "So, in order that\add this will not happen to
you\add*, keep expecting \add that I will return\add*, because you do not know when \f + \ft metonymy \f*
\add it will be\add*." 
\s Matthew 22:14-30 
\s Jesus told a parable to teach his disciples about making good use of what God has given them.
\p
\v 14 "\add When I return from heaven as king, I will deal with those who say that they have been serving me
like\add* a man who was about to go on a long journey dealt with his servants. He called them together and gave them each some
of his wealth \add to invest and gain more money for him\add*. 
\v 15 He gave them money according to their ability \add to take care of
it\add*. \add For example\add*, he gave one servant five thousand dollars, he gave another servant two thousand dollars, and he
gave another servant one thousand dollars. Then he left on his journey.
\v 16 The servant who had received five thousand dollars went immediately and used that money to gain five thousand dollars
more. 
\v 17 Similarly, the servant who had \add received\add* two thousand dollars gained
two\add thousand dollars\add* more. 
\v 18 But the servant who had received one \add thousand dollars\add* went and dug a hole in the ground and hid the money there
\add to keep it safe\add*. 
\p
\v 19 After a long time the servants' boss returned. He \add called them together
to\add* find out what they had done with his money. 
\v 20 The servant who had received five thousand dollars brought two
\add bags, each containing\add* five thousand dollars. He said, 'Boss, you gave me five thousand dollars to take care of. Look,
I have gained five thousand more!' 
\v 21 His boss replied, '\add You are a very\add* good and faithful servant!
\add You have\add* done \add very\add* well! You have faithfully handled a small
\add amount of money\add*, so I will put you in charge of a lot of things. Come and be happy with me!'
\p
\v 22 The servant who had \add received\add* two thousand dollars also came and said, 'Boss, you gave me two thousand dollars
to take care of. Look, I have gained two thousand more!' 
\v 23 His boss replied, 'You are a \add very\add* good and faithful servant! You have done very well! You have faithfully
handled a small \add amount of money\add*, so I will put you in charge of a lot of things. Come and be happy with me!'
\p
\v 24 Then the servant who had received one thousand dollars came. He said, 'Boss, I
\add was afraid of you\add*. I knew that you are a man who does not do foolish things with his money.
\add You even\add* take\add from others money\add* that does not really belong to
you\add , like a farmer who\add* harvests \add grain from another man's
field\add* where he did not even plant \add the seeds\add*. 
\v 25 So because I was afraid \add of what you would do to me if I did not make a profit from my
business\add*, I went out and hid your thousand dollars in the ground
\add to keep it safe\add*. Here, this is \add the money\add* that belongs to you!'
\v 26 His boss replied, 'You wicked, lazy servant! You knew that I
take\add from others money\add* that does not really belong to me\add , like a farmer
who\add* harvests \add grain from another man's field\add* where I did not even plant
\add the seeds\add*!\f + \ft Or: Did you not know that I \add take from others money that does not really belong to me, like a
farmer\add* who harvests \add grain from another man's field\add* where I did not even plant
\add the seeds\add*? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* 
\v 27 So then, you should have put my money \add on deposit\add* in a bank, so that when I returned I would get it back with
the interest \add it earned\add*!' 
\v 28  \add Then the boss said to his other servants\add*, 'Take the thousand dollars from him, and give it to
\add the servant\add* who has the ten thousand dollars! 
\v 29 To those who \add use well what\add* they have \add received,
God\add* will give more, and they will have plenty. But from those who
\add do\add* not \add use well what they have received\add*, even what they
\add already\add* have will be taken away. 
\v 30 Furthermore, throw that worthless servant outside, into the darkness, where he will be
\add with those who are\add* wailing and gnashing their teeth \add because they are in much
pain\add*.'Â " 
\s Matthew 22:31-46 
\s Jesus told a parable about how he will judge between those who have shown kindness to others and those who have not.
\p
\v 31 "When I, the one who came from heaven, come again, I will come with all my radiance
and\add bring\add* all my angels with me. Then I will sit as a king on my wonderful throne
\add to judge people\add*. 
\v 32 People from all nations \f + \ft metonymy \f* will be gathered in front of me
{\add The angels\add* will gather in front of me people from all nations}. Then I will separate them, one from another, as a
shepherd separates his sheep from his goats. 
\v 33 I will put \add the righteous people\add* on my right and \add the unrighteous ones on my left, as
a\add* shepherd puts sheep \add on one side\add* and goats \add on the other
side\add*." 
\p
\v 34 Then I will say to those on my right, 'You people who have been blessed by my Father {whom my Father has blessed}, come!
From the time he created the world, he has been preparing to allow you to
\add receive the blessings that he will give to all those\add* who let him rule their lives.
\add Now is the time for\add* you to receive \add those blessings\add*!
\v 35  \add They belong to you\add*, because you gave me something to eat when I was hungry. \f + \ft Or:
\add They belong to you\add*. It is as though you gave me something to eat when I was hungry. \f* You gave me something to drink
when I was thirsty. When I was a stranger \add in your town\add*, you invited me
\add to stay\add* in\add your houses\add*. 
\v 36 When I needed clothes \f + \ft metonymy \f*, you gave me some. When I was sick, you took care of me. When I was in prison, you came to
visit me.' 
\p
\v 37 Then the righteous people will reply, 'Lord, when were you hungry and we saw you and gave you something to eat? When were
you thirsty and we gave you something to drink? 
\v 38 When were you a stranger \add in our town\add* and we invited you
\add to stay\add* in\add our houses\add*? When did you need clothes and we gave you some?
\v 39 When were you sick or in prison and we went to visit you?'
\add We do not remember doing any of these things for you\add*. 
\p
\v 40 I will reply, 'The truth is that whatever you did for any one of your fellow believers, even an unimportant one,
\add it was as though\add* you did it for me.' 
\p
\v 41 Then I will say to those on my left, 'You people who have been cursed
\add by God\add* {whom God has cursed}, leave me! Go into the eternal fire that God has prepared for the devil\f + \ft Or: Satan \f* and his
angels! 
\v 42  \add It is right for you to go there\add*, because you did not give me anything to eat when I was hungry. You did not
give me anything to drink when I was thirsty. 
\v 43 You did not invite me into \add your homes\add* when I was a stranger
\add in your town\add*. You did not give me any clothes when I needed them \f + \ft metonymy \f*. You did not take care of me when I was sick
or in prison.' 
\p
\v 44 They will answer, 'Lord, when were you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison, and we
did not help you?' 
\p
\v 45 I will reply, 'The truth is that whenever you did not do anything to help any one of
\add my people\add*, \add even if they were\add* unimportant people,
\add it was as though\add* you did not do anything\add to help\add* me.'
\p
\v 46 Then those people\add on my left\add* will go away to the place where
\add they\add* will be punished {\add God\add* will punish them} eternally, but the righteous people will go to where they will
live forever \add with God\add*."
