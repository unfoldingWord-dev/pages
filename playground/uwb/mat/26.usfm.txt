\c 26  
\s Matthew 26:1-5 
\s Jesus told his disciples of his coming arrest. The Jewish leaders planned how to seize Jesus.
\p
\v 1 When Jesus had finished \add saying\add* all those things, he said to
\add us\add* disciples, 
\v 2 “You know that two days from now \add we will celebrate\add* the Passover
\add festival\add*. \add At that time\add* I, the one who came from heaven, will be put {they will put me, the one who came
from heaven,} into the hands of those who will nail me to a cross.”
\p
\v 3 At the same time the chief priests and the Jewish elders gathered in the home of the high priest, whose name was Caiaphas.
\v 4  \add There\add* they plotted how they could seize Jesus in some deceitful way so that they could have him executed.
\v 5 But they said, “\add We must\add* not \add do it\add* during the
\add Passover\add* festival, because \add if we do it then\add*, the people might riot.”
\s Matthew 26:6-13 
\s Jesus commended a woman for showing her appreciation of him. 
\p
\v 6 While Jesus \add and we\add* were in Bethany \add village\add* in the home of Simon, whom
\add Jesus had healed of\add* leprosy, 
\v 7 a woman came to him. She \add was carrying\add* a stone jar
\add containing\add* very expensive perfume. \add To show how much she
appreciated\add* Jesus, she poured the perfume on his head as he was eating.
\v 8 When \add we\add* disciples saw that, \add some of us\add* were angry.
\add One of us\add* said, “◄It is terrible that this perfume was wasted!/Why was this perfume wasted?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*
\v 9  \add We\add* could have sold it and gotten a lot of money for it! Then the money could have been given
{\add we\add* could have given the money} to poor people.” 
\v 10 Jesus knew \add what we were saying. So he\add* said to us, “◄You should not be bothering this woman!/Why are you
bothering this woman?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* She has done a beautiful thing to me.
\v 11  \add Keep in mind that\add* you will always have poor people among you,
\add so you can help them whenever you want to\add*. But I will not always be with you,
\add so it is good for her to show now that she appreciates me!\add*
\v 12 When she poured this perfume on my body, \add it was as if she knew that I am going to die soon. And it is as if
she\add* has anointed my body for being buried. 
\v 13 I will tell you this: Wherever this good message \add about
me\add* is preached {people preach this good message about me} throughout the world, those who preach it will tell what this
woman has done, \add and as a result\add* people will \add always\add* remember her.”
\s Matthew 26:14-16 
\s Judas agreed to betray Jesus for thirty silver coins. 
\p
\v 14 Then Judas Iscariot, \add even though he was\add* one of \add us\add* twelve
\add disciples\add*, went to the chief priests. 
\v 15 He asked them, “If I enable you to seize \add Jesus\add*, how much
\add money\add* are you willing to give me?” They \add agreed to give
him\add* thirty silver coins. So they counted out the coins and \add gave
them\add* to him. 
\v 16 From that time Judas watched for an opportunity to enable them to seize
\add Jesus\add*. 
\s Matthew 26:17-25 
\s Two disciples prepared the Passover meal. During the meal, Jesus said that Judas would betray him.
\p
\v 17 On the first day \add of the week-long festival\add* ◄when
\add we Jews ate\add* bread which had no yeast in it/of Unleavened Bread►,
\add we\add* disciples went to Jesus and asked, “Where do you want us to prepare
\add the meal for\add* the Passover \add celebration\add* so that
\add we can\add* eat \add it with\add* you?” 
\v 18  \add In reply\add*, he \add gave instructions to two disciples about where they should go.
He\add* said \add to them\add*, “Go into \add the city\add* to a man
\add with whom I have previously arranged this\add*. Tell him that the teacher says, ‘The time \f + \fr metonymy \f*
\add that I told you about\add* is near. I am going to celebrate the Passover
\add meal\add* with my disciples at your house, \add and I have sent these two to prepare the
meal\add*.’” 
\v 19 So the \add two\add* disciples did as Jesus told them. They
\add went and\add* prepared the Passover \add meal in that man's
house\add*. 
\p
\v 20 When it was evening, Jesus was eating the meal with \add us\add* twelve disciples.
\v 21 While we were eating, he said\add to us\add*, “Listen carefully to this: One of you is going to enable
\add my enemies\add* to seize me.” 
\v 22  \add We\add* were very sad. We began to say to him, one after the other, “Lord, ◄it is surely not I!/I'm not the one, am
I?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*” 
\v 23 He replied, “The one who will enable my enemies to seize me is the one of you who is dipping bread \f + \fr metonymy \f* into
\add the sauce in\add* the dish along with me. 
\v 24  \add It is certain that\add* I, the one who came from heaven, will
\add die\add* \f + \fr euphemism \f*, because that is what has been written {\add the
prophets\add* have written} about me. But there will be terrible punishment for the man who enables
\add my enemies\add* to seize me! It would be better for that man if he had never been born!”
\v 25 Then Judas, the one who was going to betray him, said, “Teacher, ◄surely it is not I!/I'm not the one, am I?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*”
Jesus replied, “Yes, you are the one.” 
\s Matthew 26:26-30 
\s Jesus gave the disciples the bread and wine to symbolize his coming death.
\p
\v 26 While we were eating, Jesus took \add a small loaf of\add* bread and thanked God for it. He broke it
\add into pieces\add* and gave it to \add us\add* disciples, and said, “Take this
\add bread and\add* eat \add it\add*. \add It represents\add* my body.”
\v 27 Later he took a cup \add of wine\add* and thanked \add God for
it\add*. Then he gave it to us, saying, “Drink some \add of the wine in this
cup\add*, all of you. 
\v 28  \add The wine in\add* this cup \add represents\add* my blood, which will soon flow
\add from my body when I die\add*. \add With\add* this blood I \add will
sign\add* the new agreement \add that God is making\add* to forgive the sins of many
\add people\add*. 
\v 29 Note this carefully: I will not drink wine in this way anymore until the time when I drink it with you with a new
\add meaning. That will happen\add* when my Father \add enables me to
begin\add* to rule as king.” 
\p
\v 30 After we sang a hymn, we started out towards Olive \add Tree\add* Hill.
\s Matthew 26:31-35 
\s Jesus prophesied that Peter would deny three times that he knew Jesus.
\p
\v 31  \add On the way\add*, Jesus told us, “This night all of you will desert me because of
\add what will happen to\add* me! \add This is certain to happen\add* because
\add these words that God said\add* are written \add in the Scriptures:\add* ‘I will
\add cause\add* the shepherd to be killed, and \add all\add* the sheep will be scattered {scatter}.’
\v 32 But after I have \add died and\add* become alive again, I will go ahead of you to Galilee
\add district and meet you there\add*.” 
\v 33 Peter replied, “Perhaps all \add the other disciples\add* will desert you
\add when they see what happens to you\add*, but I \add certainly\add* will never
\add leave you\add*!” 
\v 34 Jesus replied to him, “The truth is that this very night, before the rooster crows, you will say three times that you do
not know me!” 
\v 35 Peter said to him, “Even if they kill me \add while I am defending
you\add*, I will never say that I do not know you!” All \add the rest of
us\add* disciples also said the same \add thing\add*. 
\s Matthew 26:36-46 
\s While the disciples slept, Jesus prayed that God would spare him from the coming suffering.
\p
\v 36 Then Jesus went with us to a place that is called {that people call} Gethsemane. There he said to
\add most of\add* us, “Stay here while I go over there and pray.”
\v 37 He took Peter, James, and John with him. He became extremely distressed.
\v 38 Then he said to them, “I \f + \fr synecdoche \f* am very sorrowful, so much so that I
\add feel as if I were\add* about to die! Remain here and stay awake with me!”
\v 39 After going a little further, he threw himself face down \add on the
ground\add*. He prayed, “My Father, if it is possible \f + \fr metonymy \f*, do not make me have to endure the suffering
\add that is coming\add* now. But do not do as I want. Instead, do as you want!”
\v 40 Then he returned to the \add three\add* disciples and saw that they were sleeping. He
\add woke\add* Peter and said to him, “◄I am disappointed that you
\add men fell asleep and\add* were not able to stay awake with me for just a short time!/Why were you men not able to stay
awake with me for just one hour?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* 
\v 41 You must keep alert and pray so that you can resist when you are tempted {something tempts you}. You want
\add to do what I tell you\add*, but you \f + \fr synecdoche \f* are not strong enough
\add to actually do it\add*.” 
\p
\v 42 He went away a second time. He prayed, “My Father, if it is necessary for me to suffer \f + \fr litotes \f*, may what you want happen!”
\p
\v 43 When he returned to the \add three disciples\add*, he saw that they were asleep
\add again\add*. They could not keep their eyes open \f + \fr idiom \f*. 
\v 44 So he left them and went away again. He prayed the third time, saying the same thing
\add that he had prayed before\add*. 
\v 45 Then he returned to us disciples. He \add woke\add* us\add up
and\add* said to us, “◄I am disappointed that you are still sleeping and resting!/Why are you still sleeping and resting?►
\f + \fr rhetorical question \f* \add Look\add*! Someone is about to enable sinful \add men\add* to seize
\add me\add*, the one who came from heaven! 
\v 46 Get up! Let's go \add to meet them\add*! Here comes the one who is enabling them to seize me!”
\s Matthew 26:47-56 
\s After Judas enabled men to seize Jesus, Jesus ridiculed them, but the disciples fled.
\p
\v 47 While \add Jesus\add* was still speaking, Judas \add arrived. Even though he
was\add* one of \add us\add* twelve \add disciples\add*, he came
\add to enable Jesus' enemies to seize him\add*. A large crowd carrying swords and clubs was with him. They had been sent by
the chief priests and elders {the chief priests and \add Jewish\add* elders had sent them}.
\v 48 Judas had \add previously\add* arranged to give them a signal, saying, “The man whom I will kiss is the one
\add you want\add*. Seize him!” 
\v 49 He immediately went to Jesus and said, “Greetings, Teacher!” Then he kissed Jesus
\add on the neck/cheek\add*. 
\v 50 Jesus replied, “Friend, is it \add to kiss me\add* that you are here?” \f + \fr (OR, Do what you have come for!”) \f* Then
\add the men who came with Judas\add* stepped forward and seized Jesus.
\v 51 Suddenly, one of the men who was with Jesus pulled his sword out
\add of its sheath\add*. He struck the servant of the high priest
\add to kill him\add*, \add but only\add* cut off his ear. 
\v 52 Jesus said to him, “Put your sword back in its sheath! All those who try to kill others with a sword will themselves be
killed with a sword! 
\v 53 Do you think that \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* if I asked my Father, he would not immediately send more than ◄twelve armies of/72 thousand►
angels to help me? 
\v 54  \add But if I did that, what the prophets\add* have written in the Scriptures
\add about what will happen to the Messiah\add* would not be fulfilled {happen} \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*.”
\p
\v 55 At that time Jesus said to the crowd \add that was seizing
him\add*, “◄It is ridiculous that you have come \add here\add* to seize me with swords and clubs, as
\add if I were\add* a bandit!/Have you come here to seize me with swords and clubs, as if I were a bandit?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* Day after day
I sat in the Temple \add courtyard\add*, teaching \add the people\add*. Why did you not arrest me
\add then\add*? 
\v 56 But all this is happening to fulfill what the prophets\add have written
in\add* the Scriptures\add about me\add*.” Then all of us disciples deserted Jesus and ran away.
\s Matthew 26:57-68 
\s Jesus was put on trial before the Jewish Council. 
\p
\v 57 The men who had seized Jesus took him \add to the house where\add* Caiaphas, the high priest,
\add lived\add*. The men who taught the \add Jewish\add* laws and the
\add Jewish\add* elders had already gathered \add there\add*. 
\v 58 Peter followed \add Jesus\add* at a distance. He came to the high priest's courtyard. He
entered\add the courtyard\add* and sat down with the guards to see what would happen.
\p
\v 59 The chief priests and the rest of the \add Jewish\add* Council were trying to find people who would tell lies about Jesus
so that they could \add convince the Roman authorities to\add* execute him.
\v 60 But even though many people spoke lies about him, they did not find anyone
\add who said anything that was useful\add*. Finally two men came forward
\v 61 and said, “This man said, ‘I am able to destroy God's Temple and to rebuild it within three days.’”
\v 62 Then the high priest stood up and said to Jesus, “Are you not going to reply? What
\add do you say about\add* these things that they are saying \add to
accuse\add* you?” 
\v 63 But Jesus remained silent. Then the high priest said to him, “I command you to tell us
\add the truth\add*, knowing that the all-powerful God \add is listening to
you\add*: Are you the Messiah, ◄the Son of God/the man who is also God►?”
\v 64 Jesus replied, “Yes, \add it is as\add* you say. But I will also say this to all of you: Some day you will see
\add me\add*, the one who came from heaven, sitting beside \f + \fr metonymy \f* Almighty
\add God\add*, and ruling. You will also see me coming on the clouds
\add from\add* heaven!” 
\p
\v 65 Then the high priest tore his outer garment. \add That was the custom to show that he was shocked to hear Jesus say that
he was equal to God\add*. Then he said, “This man has insulted God! He claims to be equal with God! ◄We certainly do not need
anyone else to testify \add against this man\add*!/Why should we seek any more people who will testify
\add against this man\add*?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* You heard what he said! 
\v 66 What have you decided?” \add The Jewish leaders\add* replied,
“\add According to our laws\add*, he \add is guilty and\add* deserves to be executed!”
\v 67 Then \add some of them\add* spat in his face. \add Others\add* struck him with their fists. Others,
\add after they blindfolded him\add*, slapped him 
\v 68 and said, “\add Since you claim that\add* \f + \fr irony \f* \add you are\add* the Messiah, tell us who hit you!”
\s Matthew 26:69-75 
\s Peter denied three times that he knew Jesus. 
\p
\v 69 Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard. A servant girl came up to him
\add and looked at him\add*. She said, “You also were with Jesus,
\add that man\add* from Galilee \add district\add*!” 
\v 70 But while everyone there was listening, he denied it. He said, “I do not know what you are talking about!”
\v 71 Then he went out to the gateway of the courtyard. Another servant girl saw him and said to the people who were standing
nearby, “This man was with Jesus, \add the man\add* from Nazareth.”
\v 72 But \add Peter\add* again denied it. He said, “May God punish me
\add if I am lying\add*! I \add tell you\add*, I do not even know that man!”
\v 73 After a little while, one of the people who were standing there approached Peter and said to him, “It is certain that you
are one of those \add who were with that man\add*. We can tell from your accent that you
\add are from Galilee.”\add* 
\v 74 Then Peter began to proclaim loudly that God should curse him
\add if he was lying\add*. He asked God in heaven to witness \add that he was telling the
truth\add* and said, “I do not know that man!” Immediately a rooster crowed.
\v 75 Then Peter remembered the words that Jesus had spoken \add to
him\add*, “Before the rooster crows, you will say three times that you do not know me.” And Peter went
\add out of the courtyard\add*, crying because he was very sad \add about what he had
done\add*.
