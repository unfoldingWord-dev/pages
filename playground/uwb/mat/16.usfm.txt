\c 16  
\s Matthew 16:1-4 
\s Jesus again told the religious leaders that the only miracle that he would do for them was one like God did for Jonah.
\p
\v 1  \add Some\add* Pharisees and Sadducees came to \add Jesus\add* and asked him
\add to perform\add* a miracle that would prove \add that\add* God \f + \fr euphemism \f*
\add had sent him\add*. 
\v 2 He answered them, “\add In this country\add*, in the evening you say,
‘\add It will be\add* good weather \add tomorrow\add*, because the sky is red.’
\v 3  \add Early\add* in the morning \add you say\add*, ‘It will be stormy weather today, because the sky is red, and dark
clouds have formed.’ You understand how to predict \add the weather by looking at the
sky\add*, but you cannot \add seem to look at what is happening\add*
now\add and by that\add* understand \add what God is doing\add*.
\v 4  \add You\add* evil people have seen me\add perform miracles\add* but you do not faithfully worship God \f + \fr metaphor \f*. You want to
see \add me perform\add* a miracle \add that would prove that God has sent
me\add*. But \add God\add* will \add enable you to see\add* only one miracle. It will be
\add like\add* what happened \f + \fr metaphor \f* to Jonah, \add the prophet, who was inside a huge fish for three days and then came out of
it to live again\add*.” Then Jesus left them and sailed away, \add along with us
disciples\add*. 
\s Matthew 16:5-12 
\s Jesus rebuked the disciples for worrying about not having enough food.
\p
\v 5  \add We\add* forgot to take bread when \add we\add* sailed to another edge of
\add the lake\add*. 
\v 6  \add Then\add* Jesus said to us, “Beware \add that you do not
accept\add* the yeast \f + \fr metaphor \f* that the Pharisees and Sadducees \add distribute\add*.”
\v 7 Then, \add not realizing that he was speaking figuratively\add*,
\add we\add* said to one another, “\add He must have said that\add* because we forgot to bring any bread!”
\v 8 Because Jesus knew what\add we were saying\add*, he said \add to
us\add*, “◄I am disappointed that you are discussing among yourselves,
\add thinking\add* that \add it was because\add* you did not bring any bread
\add that I talked about the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees\add*./Why are you discussing among yourselves thinking that
it was because you did not bring any bread \add that I talked about the yeast of the Pharisees and
Sadducees\add*?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* You believe only a little \add what I am able to do for
you\add*. 
\v 9 ◄You should understand \add that I can continue to do miracles to provide for what you
need./\add*Do you not yet understand \add that I can provide miraculously for you if you need
food\add*?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* Do you not remember that five thousand \add people ate when I multiplied
the\add* five small loaves \add and the two fish? And after everyone had enough to
eat\add*, you collected \add twelve\add* baskets \add of left-over
pieces\add* \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*! 
\v 10  \add Do you not remember\add* \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* \add that\add* four thousand
\add people ate when I multiplied the\add* seven small loaves \add and a few
fish\add*? And \add after everyone had enough to eat\add*, you collected
\add seven\add* large baskets \add of left-over pieces\add*! 
\v 11 ◄You should have understood that I was not speaking about \add real\add* bread
\add that contains yeast\add*./Why have you not understood that I was not speaking about
\add real\add* bread \add that contains yeast?\add*► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* What I
\add was saying\add* was that you should \add not accept what\add* the Pharisees and Sadducees
\add say, because it would affect you like\add* yeast \add affects\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f*
\add dough\add*.” 
\v 12 Then we understood that he was not talking about the yeast that is
\add in\add* bread. Instead, \add he was talking\add* about the \add wrong\add* teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
\s Matthew 16:13-20 
\s Jesus commented on the implications of Peter's recognition of Jesus being the Messiah.
\p
\v 13 When Jesus came with \add us\add* disciples to the region near Caesarea Philippi
\add town\add*, he asked us, “Who do people say that I, the one who came from heaven,
\add really\add* am?” 
\v 14 We answered, “Some\add people say that you are\add* John the Baptizer,
\add who has come back to life again\add*. Others say \add that you are the
prophet\add* Elijah, \add who has returned from heaven as God promised\add*.
\add Still\add* others \add say that you are the prophet\add* Jeremiah or one of the
\add other\add* prophets \add who lived long ago, who has come back to life
again\add*.” 
\v 15 Jesus said to us, “\add What about\add* you? Who do you say that I am?”
\v 16 Simon Peter said to him, “You are the Messiah! You are the Son of the all-powerful God.”
\v 17 Then Jesus said to him, “Simon, son of Jonah, \add God\add* is pleased with you. What you just said was not \f + \fr synecdoche \f*
revealed to you by any human. Instead, \add it was\add* my Father
\add who lives\add* in heaven \add who revealed this to you\add*.
\v 18 I will also tell you this: You are Peter, \add which means
rock\add*. \add You are like\add* a rock. What you \add and your fellow apostles
teach\add* \f + \fr (OR, \add what\add* you\add do\add*) \add will be like a foundation on which
I\add* will create congregations of people who \add believe in\add* me. And the demons \f + \fr personification \f*,
\add who live\add* where the dead people who lived evil lives are, will not be able to
\add come and\add* prevent \f + \fr metaphor \f* \add me from doing\add* that.” 
\v 19  \add Then, speaking to all of us, he said\add*, “I will enable
you\add (pl) \f*\add* to have authority \f + \fr metonymy \f* over the groups of people over whose lives
\add God\add* rules. Whatever you forbid regarding those people \f + \fr metonymy \f*, it will have been forbidden by God. Whatever you permit
\f + \fr metaphor \f* regarding them, it will have been permitted by God.” 
\v 20 Then Jesus warned \add us\add* disciples strongly not to tell anyone
\add at that time\add* that he is the Messiah. 
\s Matthew 16:21-23 
\s Jesus began to teach the disciples about his coming death and resurrection.
\p
\v 21 From that time Jesus began to teach \add us\add* disciples that it was necessary for him to go to Jerusalem
\add city\add*. There the ruling elders, the chief priests, and the men who taught the
\add Jewish\add* laws would cause him to suffer and be killed {die}. Then on the third day
\add after that\add*, he would become alive again. 
\v 22  \add Because Peter assumed that the Messiah would not suffer and
die\add*, he took Jesus aside and began to rebuke him\add for talking about suffering and
dying\add*. He said, “Lord, may \add God\add* never permit that to happen to you! That must certainly not happen!”
\v 23 Then Jesus turned \add to look at\add* Peter, and he said to him, “Stop talking to me
\add like that\add* \f + \fr metonymy \f*! \add Stop saying what\add* Satan \f + \fr metaphor \f*
\add would say, and stop\add* trying to prevent \add from happening what God has
planned!\add* You are a hindrance to me, because you are not thinking like God thinks. Instead,
\add you are thinking\add* like people \add think\add*!” 
\s Matthew 16:24-28 
\s Jesus taught the disciples more about what they would face as his disciples, and about his coming again.
\p
\v 24 Then Jesus said to \add us\add* disciples, “If any one \add of
you\add* wants to be my disciple, you must not do \add only\add* what you yourself
want\add to do\add*. \add You\add* must be willing to \add let people hurt you and disgrace you. That is like what they do to
criminals whom they force to\add* carry a cross \f + \fr metaphor \f* \add to the place where the criminals will be executed. That is what
anyone who wants to\add* be my disciple\add must do\add*. 
\v 25  \add You must do that\add*, because those who try to save their lives
\add by denying that they belong to me when people want to kill them for believing in
me\add* will not live \add eternally\add*, but those who are killed
\add because of being my disciples\add* will live \add with God eternally\add*.
\v 26 People \add might\add* get everything \add they want\add* in this world, but
◄\add if they do not become my disciples\add*, they would really be gaining nothing
\add because\add* they would not get eternal life!/what would they gain
\add if they do not become my disciples and thus\add* do not get eternal life?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* ◄There is absolutely nothing that people
can give \add to God\add* that would enable them to gain eternal life./What can people give
\add to God\add* that could enable them to gain eternal life?► [MTY, RHQ]
\v 27  \add Listen carefully: I\add*, the one who came from heaven,
\add will leave this earth, but\add* I will return, and the angels of heaven will accompany me. At that time I will have the
glorious \add radiance\add* that my Father has, and I will reward everyone according to what they did
\add when they were living on earth\add*. 
\v 28 Listen carefully! Some of you who are here now will see \add me\add*, the one who came from heaven, when I return to
rule. You will see this before you die!”
