\c 3  
\s Matthew 3:1-6 
\s John the Baptizer announced the coming of Jesus, and he baptized many people who heard his message.
\p
\v 1 While \add Jesus was still in Nazareth town\add*, John, \add whom the people
called\add* the Baptizer, went to a desolate place in Judea \add district\add*.
\v 2 He was preaching \add to the people who came there\add*. He kept saying,
"\add You need to\add* turn away from your sinful behavior, because God \f + \ft metaphor \f* will soon begin to rule
\add over people, and he will reject you if you do not turn away from your sinful
life\add*." 
\v 3 John was the person who \add fulfilled\add* what was said by Isaiah the prophet \f + \ft Or:what Isaiah the prophet
\add predicted\add* when he said \f*, long ago, 
\pi In a desolate area \add people will hear someone\f + \ft Or: someone will be
heard\add* \f* shouting \add to the people who pass by\add*, 
\pi Prepare \add yourselves to receive\add* the Lord when he comes!
\pi \add Make yourselves ready so that you will be prepared when he
comes\add* \f + \ft metaphor, doublet \f*, just like people straighten out the road \add for an important
official!\add* 
\p
\v 4 John wore \add coarse\add* clothing made from camel's hair. And
\add as the prophet Elijah did long ago\add*, he wore a leather belt around his waist. His food was
\add only\add* grasshoppers and honey \add that he found\add* in that desolate area.
\v 5  \add People who lived in\add* Jerusalem \add city\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*, many \f + \ft hyperbole \f*
\add people who lived in other places in\add* Judea \add district\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*, and many \f + \ft hyperbole \f*
\add people who lived in\add* the area around the Jordan \add River\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* came to John
\add to hear him preach\add*. 
\v 6 After \add they heard him tell them to turn away from their sinful
behavior\add*, they \add openly\add* confessed their sins, and as a result they were baptized by John \f + \ft Or:John baptized them \f* in
the Jordan River. 
\s Matthew 3:7-10 
\s John told the Pharisees and Sadducees that they needed to repent before he would baptize them.
\p
\v 7 After John noted that many men of the Pharisee \add religious
group\add* and of the Sadducee \add religious group\add* were coming
\add to him\add* to be baptized \f + \ft Or:in order that he would baptize them \f*, he said to them, "You people are
\add evil like poisonous\add* snakes \f + \ft metaphor \f*! I warn you that God will some day punish \f + \ft metonymy \f* everyone who sins. And do not think
that you can escape from his punishing you \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add if you do not turn from your sinful
behavior\add*!\f + \ft Or: Did someone tell you that you can escape from his punishing you ( metonymy )
\add if you do not turn from your sinful behavior\add*? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* 
\v 8 Do what is appropriate [IDI] for people who have truly turned away from their sinful behavior
\add before you come to me in order to be baptized\add* \f + \ft Or:\add that I baptize
you\add* \f*. 
\v 9  \add God promised to give Abraham many descendants. In order to fulfill that
promise\add*, God\add does not need you! I\add* tell you that he can change these stones to make them descendants of Abraham.
So do not start to say to yourselves, 'Since we are descendants of
\add our ancestor\add* Abraham, \add God will not punish us even though we have
sinned\add*.' 
\v 10  \add God is\add* ready \add to punish you if you do not turn away from your sinful behavior, just
like\add* a man who lays his axe at the roots of a \add fruit\add* tree
\add in order to\add* chop it down and throw it into the fire if it does not produce good fruit \f + \ft metaphor \f*."
\s Matthew 3:11-12 
\s John said that someone greater than him would soon come who would enable some of the people to change their lives and who
would severely punish the others. 
\p
\v 11 "As for me, I \add am not very important, because\add* I baptize you
\add only\add* with water. I \add baptize you\add* because of your feeling sorry that you have sinned. But someone else will
come soon who is very great; \add he will do powerful deeds\add*
(OR\add , act powerfully\add*)\add . Because he is\add* superior to me, I am not worthy
\add even to do a menial task for him, such as\add* to carry his sandals.
\p He will put \add his\add* Holy Spirit \add within\add* you \add to truly
change\add* the way you live \f + \ft metaphor \f*, and \add he will judge others of you and punish you
in\add* the fire \add in hell\add*. 
\v 12  \add He is like a farmer who wants to clear away the grain that is on the ground where it has been
threshed\add* \f + \ft Or:\add they have threshed it\add* \f*\add . That farmer uses
a\add* huge fork to throw the grain into the air \add to separate the wheat from the
chaff\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, and then he cleans up the threshing area. \add Similarly\add*, God will
\add separate righteous people from the evil people like a farmer
who\add* gathers the wheat into his storage area, and then \add God\add* will burn
the\add people who are like\add* chaff with a fire that will never be put out \f + \ft metaphor \f*."
\s Matthew 3:13-17 
\s When John baptized Jesus, God showed that Jesus was his Son by sending the Holy Spirit upon him.
\p
\v 13 During that time, Jesus went from Galilee \add District\add* to the Jordan
\add River\add*, where John was. \add He did that\add* in order to be baptized by John \f + \ft Or:in order to ask that John would baptize
him \f*. 
\v 14  \add When Jesus asked John to baptize him\add*, John objected, saying, "I need to be baptized by
\bd you\bd* \f + \ft Or:\bd you\bd* to baptize \bd me\bd* \f* \add because you are superior to me. Since you are not a
sinner\add*, \add you\f + \ft singular \f*\add* should not come to me \add to be baptized by
me\add* \f + \ft Or:\add to ask that I baptize you\f + \ft singular \f*\add* \f*!\f + \ft Or: why do you come to me
\add to be baptized by me\add* \f + \ft Or:\add ask that I baptize you\f + \ft singular \f*\add* \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*? \f*"
\v 15 But Jesus said to him, "Baptize me at this time, because in this way we
\add two\add* will do \add everything that God\add* requires." Then John consented to baptize him.
\p
\v 16 After he was baptized \f + \ft Or:John baptized Jesus \f*, Jesus immediately came up out of the water. Just then,
\add it was as though\add* the sky was opened \f + \ft Or:split apart \f*. Then
\add Jesus\add* saw God's Spirit coming down upon him. He came in the form of a dove.
\v 17 Then \add God\add* \f + \ft synecdoche \f* spoke from heaven, saying, "This is my Son. I love him. I am very pleased with him."
