\s Matthew 13:1-10 
\s Jesus taught a parable about different kinds of soil. 
\p
\v 1 That same day Jesus, \add along with us\add* disciples, left the house
\add where he was teaching and went\add* to \add Galilee lake\add*. He sat down there,
\v 2 and a very large crowd gathered around him to \add listen to his
teaching\add*. So, \add in order that they would not jostle him\add* \f + \ft Or:
\add to speak to the people better\add*), he got into a boat and sat down
\add to teach them\add*. The crowd stood on the shore \add and was
listening\add*. 
\v 3 He was telling them many parables. \add One of the parables\add* that he told them was this: “Listen! A man went out
\add to his field\add* to sow \add some seeds\add*. 
\v 4 As he was scattering \add them over the soil\add*, some \add of
the\add* seeds fell on the path. Then some birds came and ate those seeds.
\v 5 Other \add seeds\add* fell on ground where there was not much soil
\add on top of the\add* rock. Those seeds sprouted very soon, \add because the sun quickly
warmed\add* the shallow soil. 
\v 6 But when \add the young plants came up\add*, they were scorched by the sun, and they withered because they did not have
\add deep\add* roots. 
\v 7 Other seeds fell on \add ground that contained roots of\add* thorny
\add weeds\add*. The thorny weeds grew \add together with the young
plants\add*, and \add they\add* crowded out \add the plants\add*.
\v 8  \add But\add* other seeds fell on good soil, and \add the plants grew
and\add* produced \add a lot of\add* grain. Some \add plants produced\add* one hundred
times\add as many seeds as were planted\add*. Some \add plants produced\add* sixty times
\add as much\add*. Some \add plants produced\add* thirty times\add as
much\add*. 
\v 9 If you want to understand this \f + \ft metonymy \f*, you should consider \add carefully what I have just
said\add*.” 
\s Matthew 13:10-17 
\s Jesus told the disciples why he taught them using parables. 
\p
\v 10  \add We\add* disciples approached Jesus and said to him, “Why do you use parables when you speak to the crowd?”
\v 11 He answered \add us\add* by saying, “God [EUP\f + \ft Or: MTY \f*] is revealing to you what he did not reveal before, about
\add how he wants to\add* rule \add over people's lives\add*. But he has not revealed it to others.
\v 12 Those who \add think about what I say and\add* understand \add it\add*, God will enable them to understand more. But
those who do not \add think carefully about what I say\add* will forget even what they already know.
\v 13 That is why I use parables when I speak to people, because although they see
\add what I do\add*, they do not perceive \add what it means\add*, and although they hear
\add what I say\add*, they do not really understand \add what it
means\add*. 
\v 14 What these people do completely fulfills what \add God told\add* the prophet Isaiah
\add to say long ago to the people who did not\add* try to understand what he said,
\p You will hear \add what I say\add*, but you will not understand it. You will keep seeing
\add what I do\add*, but you will not understand \add what it means\add* \f + \ft doublet \f*.
\p
\v 15  \add God also said to Isaiah\add*, 
\q These people have become unresponsive \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add to what they see me do and to what they hear me
say\add*. They listen unwillingly \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add to what I say\add*, and they do not pay attention to \f + \ft metonymy \f*
\add what I do\add*. If it were not so, they would perceive \f + \ft metonymy \f*
\add what I am doing\add*, they would understand \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add what I say to
them\add*, and they would turn \add away from their sinful lives\add* and
turn\add to me\add*, and I would save them \add from being punished for their
sins\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. 
\p
\v 16 But as for you, God is pleased with you because you \f + \ft synecdoche \f* have seen
\add what I have done\add* and because you \f + \ft synecdoche \f* understand \add what I
say\add* \f + \ft doublet \f*. 
\v 17 Note this: Many prophets and righteous people \add who lived long
ago\add* longed to see what you are seeing \add me do\add*, but they did not see it. They longed to hear the things that you
have been hearing \add me say\add*, but they did not hear \add what you hear me
say\add*.” \f + \ft doublet \f* 
\s Matthew 13:18-23 
\s Jesus explained that the parable about the kinds of soil illustrates four different ways people respond to his teaching.
\p
\v 18 “\add Since God wants\add* you\add to understand what I am teaching
you\add*, listen as I \add explain\add* the parable about the man who sowed
\add seeds in various kinds of soil\add*. 
\v 19 The people who hear about how God rules over people's lives and do not understand
\add what they have heard\add* are \add like\add* the path where
\add some of\add* the seeds fell. \add Satan\add*, the Evil One, comes and causes these people to forget \f + \ft metaphor \f* what they have
heard \f + \ft metaphor \f*. 
\v 20  \add Some people are like the\add* shallow soil on top of rock. When they hear God's message, they immediately accept it
joyfully. 
\v 21  \add But because it does not penetrate deeply into their hearts, they believe it for
only\add* a \add short\add* time\add . They are like the plants that\add* did not
have\add deep\add* roots. When they are treated badly and caused to suffer because they believe
\add God's message\add*, they soon stop believing \add it\add*. 
\v 22  \add Some people are like the soil that had the roots of\add* thorny
\add weeds\add* in it. They hear God's message, but they desire to be rich,
\add so they\add* worry \add only\add* about [MTY, PRS] material things. As a result, they \f + \ft personification \f* forget
\add God's\add* message and they do not do [IDI] the things that God wants them to do.
\v 23 But \add some people are like the\add* good soil where \add some of the
seeds\add* fell. \add Just like the plants that grew in this soil\add* produced a lot of grain,
\add these people\add* hear my message and understand it. \add Some of
them\add* do many things [IDI] \add that please God, some do\add* even
more\add things that please God, and some do\add* very many \add things that please
God\add*.” 
\s Matthew 13:24-30 
\s Jesus told a parable about wheat and weeds. 
\p
\v 24 Jesus also told the crowd another parable, \add by which he tried to explain that
although\add* God [MTY\f + \ft Or: EUP \f*] is a king, \add he will not immediately judge and punish all the wicked
people\add*. Jesus said, “\add God\add* is like a landowner \add who sent his
servants\add* to sow good \add wheat\add* seed in his field. 
\v 25 While those servants were sleeping \add and not watching the
field\add*, an enemy of the landowner came and scattered weed \add seeds\add* in the midst of the wheat. Then he left.
\v 26 After \add the seeds\add* sprouted and the green plants \add grew\add*, the heads of grain began to form. But the weeds
also grew. 
\v 27 So the servants of the landowner came and said to him, ‘Sir, you \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\add gave us good seeds and those are the ones we\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add planted\add* in your field. So where did the weeds come
from?’ 
\v 28 The landowner said to them, ‘\add My\add* enemy did this.’ His servants said to him, ‘So, do you want us to pull up
\add the weeds and\add* put them in a pile?’ 
\v 29 He said \add to them\add*, ‘No, \add do not do that, because\add* you might pull up
\add some of\add* the wheat at the same time. 
\v 30 Let the wheat and the weeds grow together until harvest\add time\add*.’ At that time I will say to the reapers, ‘First
gather the weeds, tie them into bundles to be burned. Then gather the wheat
\add and put it\add* into my barns.’” 
\s Matthew 13:31-33 
\s Jesus illustrated the effects of people letting God rule their lives.
\p
\v 31 Jesus also told this parable: “The \add number of\add* (OR\add , God's influence in the lives
of\add* \f* \add people whose\add* lives God rules over \add will continue to grow. It is very
much\add* like mustard seeds grow after a man plants them in his field.
\v 32 Although mustard seeds are among the smallest of all the seeds\add that people plant, here in Israel they become large
plants. When the plants have fully grown, they are larger than the other garden plants. They become shrubs that are large
enough for the birds to build nests in their branches.”\add* 
\p
\v 33 Jesus also told this parable: “\add The way people who let\add* God [MTY\f + \ft Or: EUP \f*] rule their lives \f + \ft metaphor \f*
\add can influence the world\add* is like yeast that a woman mixed with about fifty pounds of flour.
\add That small amount of yeast made\add* the whole batch of dough swell up.”
\s Matthew 13:34-35 
\s Jesus' use of parables fulfilled a prophecy in Scripture. 
\p
\v 34 Jesus told the crowd parables \add to teach them\add* all these things. When he spoke \f + \ft hyperbole \f* to them he habitually used
such illustrations. 
\v 35 By doing that, \add he\add* fulfilled what \add God told one
of\add* the prophets to write \add long ago\add*. 
\p I will speak \f + \ft metonymy \f* in parables; I will tell \add parables to teach\add* what I have kept secret since I created the world.
\s Matthew 13:36-43 
\s Jesus explained the parable about wheat and weeds. The wheat represents those who obey God, and the weeds represents those
who disobey God. The reaping represents judgment. 
\p
\v 36 After Jesus dismissed the crowds, he went into the house. Then
\add we\add* disciples approached him and said, “Explain to us the parable about the weeds
\add that grew\add* in the \add wheat\add* field.” 
\v 37 He answered, “The one who sows the good seed represents \add me\add*, the one who came from heaven.
\v 38 The field represents this world \f + \ft metonymy \f*, \add where people live\add*. The seeds
\add that grew\add* well represent the people who let God rule their lives \f + \ft metaphor \f*. The weeds represent the people who do what
\add the devil\add*, the Evil One, \add tells them to do\add*. 
\v 39 The enemy who sowed the weed seeds represents the devil. The
\add time when the reapers will\add* harvest \add the grain\add* represents the time when the world will end. The reapers
represent the angels. 
\v 40 The weeds are gathered and burned. {The reapers gather the weeds. Then they burn them.} That represents
\add the judging of people, which God will do\add* when the world will end.
\add It will be like this\add*: 
\v 41 I, the one who came from heaven, will send my angels and they will gather
\add from everywhere the people\add* who cause others to quit believing in me \f + \ft metaphor \f* and all those who disobey
\add God's\add* commands. 
\v 42 They will throw those people into the fires of\add hell\add*. There they will weep and grind their teeth
\add because of the great pain that they are suffering\add*. 
\v 43  \add God's\add* brightness will shine \add on\add* the people who have lived as he wants them to. It will shine
\add on them as brightly\add* as the sun \add shines\add*. It will shine on them in the place where
\add God\add*, their Father, rules over them. If you want to understand this \f + \ft metonymy \f*, you should think
\add carefully\add* about what I have just said.” 
\s Matthew 13:44-50 
\s Jesus illustrated the value of letting God rule our lives. 
\p
\v 44 “\add What people do who begin to allow\add* God [MTY\f + \ft Or: EUP \f*] to rule their lives is like
\add what a certain man did to acquire a treasure\add*. A treasure was hidden in a field by someone {Someone hid a treasure in
a field \add and never dug it up again\add*}. When \add another\add* man found it, he hid it
\add by burying it again in order that no one else would find it\add*. Being very happy
\add that he had found something very valuable, he went and\add* sold all his possessions
\add to obtain money to buy the field the treasure was in\add*. He then went and bought the field,
\add and so he was able to acquire that treasure\add*. 
\p
\v 45 Also, what \add people do who begin to allow\add* God [MTY\f + \ft Or: EUP \f*] to rule their lives is like
\add what\add* a merchant \add did who was\add* looking for good quality pearls
\add to buy\add*. 
\v 46 When he found one very costly pearl \add that was for sale\add*, he sold all his possessions
\add to acquire enough money to buy that pearl\add*. Then he \add went
and\add* bought it. 
\p
\v 47 What God [MTY\f + \ft Or: EUP \f*] \add will do to people who falsely say that they are letting
him\add* rule their lives is like what certain \add fishermen\add* did
\add with the fish they caught\add* in a lake, using a large net. They caught all classes
\add of fish, both useful and worthless fish\add*. 
\v 48 When the net was full, the \add fishermen\add* pulled it up onto the shore. Then they sat there and put the useful
\add fish\add* into buckets, and threw the worthless ones away. 
\v 49  \add What they did in separating the good fish from the bad
ones\add* is like \add what will happen to people\add* when the world ends. The angels will come
\add to where God is judging people\add* and will separate the wicked
\add people\add* from the righteous \add ones\add*. 
\v 50 They will throw the wicked people into the fire \add in hell\add*. And those wicked people will weep and gnash their
teeth \add because of the intense pain they are suffering\add*.”
\s Matthew 13:51-52 
\s Jesus illustrated the value of understanding his parables. 
\p
\v 51  \add Then Jesus asked us\add*, “Do you understand all these
\add parables I have told you\add*?” We said to him, 
\v 52 “Yes, \add we understand them\add*.” Then he said to us, “Because
\add you understand all these parables\add*, \add you will understand the following parable: You, along
with\add* all others, will teach people what \add you heard me say\add* about God ruling people's lives.
\add You will add that to what you formerly learned. You will be\add* like a manager of a household who takes both new things
and old things out of his storage room.” 
\s Matthew 13:53-58 
\s Jesus did not do many miracles in Nazareth because people there rejected him as the Messiah.
\p
\v 53 When Jesus had finished \add telling\add* these parables, he
took\add us\add* and left that \add area\add*. 
\v 54 We went to \add Nazareth, his hometown. ◄On the Sabbath\f + \ft Or: On \f* the Jewish rest
day\add*► he began to teach the people in the Jewish worship house. The result was that the people there were astonished.
But\add some\add* said, “\add This man is just an ordinary person like
us\add*! \add So\add* how is it that he knows so much and understands so much \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*? And how is it that he is able to do
\add such\add* miracles \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*? 
\v 55 ◄He is \add just\add* the son of the carpenter!\f + \ft Or: Isn \f*'t he \add just\add* the son of the carpenter
\add that lived here\add*?► \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* His mother is Mary, and his younger brothers are James, Joseph, Simon and Judas \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*!
\v 56 ◄And his sisters \add also live\add* here in our \add town\add*.\f + \ft Or: Do \f* not his sisters
\add live\add* in our \add town\add*?► \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* So how is he able to do all
these\add miracles\add*?” 
\v 57 The people were unable to accept\add that\add* he\add was the Messiah.
So\add* Jesus said to them, “\add People\add* honor \add me and other\add* prophets
\add everywhere else we go\add*, but in \add our\add* hometowns \add we
are\add* not\add honored\add*, and \add even\add* our own families do not
\add honor us!\add*” 
\v 58 Jesus did not perform many miracles there because the people did not believe
\add that he was the Messiah\add*.
