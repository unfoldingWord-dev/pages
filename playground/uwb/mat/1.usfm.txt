\v 17  \add As you can calculate, I have grouped Jesus'\add* ancestors

\add the time when\add* Abraham \add lived\add* to \add the time when
King\add* David \add lived\add*. There was \add a succession of\add* fourteen of them from
\add the time when\add* David \add lived\add* to \add the time when\add* the
\add Israelites were taken\add* {\add the Babylonian army took the
Israelites\add*} away to Babylon. There was \add a succession of\add* fourteen of them from
\add the time when the Israelites were taken\add* {\add the Babylonian army took the
Israelites\add*} away to Babylon until \add the time when\add* the Messiah
\add was born\add*. 
\s Matthew 1:18-25 
\s When Joseph learned that Mary was pregnant, he decided to divorce her, but an angel told him to take her as his wife because
it was the power of the Holy Spirit that had enabled her to be pregnant.
\p
\v 18 This is \add the account of what happened just before\add* Jesus Christ was born. Mary, his mother, {had publicly
promised Joseph that she would marry him} had been publicly promised to marry Joseph. Before they began to live together \f + \ft euphemism \f*,
\add Mary\add* realized that she was pregnant. \add It was the power
of\add* the Holy Spirit that had caused her to become pregnant \f + \ft euphemism \f*.
\v 19 Joseph, \add whom people considered to be\add* her husband, was a man who obeyed God's commands.
\add One of those commands was that men must divorce women who had acted immorally. So when Joseph learned that Mary was
pregnant, he assumed that she was pregnant as a result of her acting
immorally\add*. So he decided to divorce her\f + \ft Or: to break the engagement \f*. But because he did not want to shame her publicly, he
decided to divorce her privately. 
\v 20 While he was seriously considering this, much to his surprise, in a dream he saw an angel whom the
Lord\add sent\add*. The angel said, "Joseph, descendant of \add King\add* David, do not be afraid that
\add you\f + \ft singular \f* would be doing wrong if you\f + \ft singular \f* would marry\add* Mary. Instead,
\add begin to treat her\add* as your wife, because the Holy Spirit,
\add not a man\add*, has caused her to be pregnant. 
\v 21 She will give birth to a son. Since it is he who will cause that his people will be saved from
\add the guilt of\add* their having sinned, name \add the baby\add* Jesus,
\add which means 'the Lord saves people'\add*." 
\v 22 All this happened as a result of what the Lord told the prophet
\add Isaiah to write long ago about what was going to happen\add*. This is what Isaiah wrote:
\v 23 "Listen, a virgin will become pregnant and will give birth to a son. They will call him Emmanuel." Emmanuel means 'God is
with us.' 
\v 24 When Joseph got up from sleep, he did what the angel whom the Lord
\add had sent\add* commanded him to do. He \add began to live with
Mary\add* as his wife. 
\v 25 But he did not have sexual relations with her \f + \ft euphemism \f* until she had given birth to a son. And
\add Joseph\add* named him Jesus.
