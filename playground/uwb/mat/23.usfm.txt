\c 23  
\s Matthew 23:1-12 
\s Jesus warned the people against the hypocritical behavior of the religious leaders.
\p
\v 1 Then Jesus said to the crowd and to us his disciples, 
\v 2 “\bd Moses\bd* was the \add renowned\add* teacher who taught
\add the people the laws that God gave him\add* \f + \fr metonymy \f*. Now, the Pharisees and the men who teach our
\add Jewish\add* laws have made themselves the ones who interpret those laws \f + \fr idiom \f*.
\v 3 Consequently, you should do \bd whatever they tell you that you must
do.\bd* But do not do what they do, because they themselves do not do what they tell
\add you that you must do\add*. 
\v 4 They \add require you to obey many rules that are difficult to
obey\add*. But \bd they themselves\bd* \add do not help anyone obey those rules. It
is\add* as if they are tying up loads that are hard to carry and putting them on your shoulders \f + \fr metaphor \f*
\add for you to carry. But they\add* \bd themselves\bd* \add do not desire to help anyone obey those laws. They are
like\add* people who do not want to lift \add even the slightest
load\add* that they \add could lift\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f* 
\v 5  \add with\add* one finger. Whatever they do, they do it to be seen by other people {so that other people will see them
doing that}. \add For example\add*, they make extra wide the tiny boxes containing portions of Scripture that they wear on
their arms. They enlarge the tassels on their robes, \add to make others think that they are
pious\add*. 
\v 6  \add They want people to honor them. For example\add*, at dinner parties they sit in the seats where the most important
people sit. In the places of worship \add they want to sit\add* in the seats where the most honored people sit.
\v 7 Also, \add they want people to\add* greet them \add respectfully\add* in the marketplaces and to honor them by calling
them ‘Teacher’. 
\v 8 But you \add who are my disciples\add* should not allow people to address you
\add honorably\add* as ‘Rabbi’, \add which means ‘teacher\add*’. I
\add am the\add* only one who is \add really\add* your teacher, which means that you are all
\add equal, like\add* brothers and sisters, \add and none of you should act superior to another, as the Pharisees
do\add*. 
\v 9 Do not \add honor anyone\add* on earth \add by\add* addressing him as ‘Father’, because God, your Father in heaven, is the
only \add spiritual\add* father of all of you. 
\v 10 Do not \add allow people to\add* call you ‘Instructors’, because I, the Messiah, am the one instructor
who\add teaches all of\add* you. 
\v 11 In contrast, everyone among you who wants \add God to consider
them\add* to be important must serve others as servants do. 
\v 12  \add God\add* will humble those who exalt themselves. And
\add he\add* will exalt those who humble themselves.” 
\s Matthew 23:13-14 
\s Jesus warned the religious leaders about preventing people from letting God rule their lives.
\p
\v 13-14  \add Then Jesus said to the religious leaders\add*, “You men who teach the
\add Jewish\add* laws and you Pharisees are hypocrites! There will be terrible punishment for
\add you, because by teaching what is false\add*, you \add prevent
people\add* [MTY/HYP] \add who are thinking about letting\add* God rule their lives
\add from doing that\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f*. \add What you are doing is like\add* closing a gate \f + \fr metaphor \f*
\add so that people who\add* are wanting to enter \add a city cannot go
in\add*. As for \bd you,\bd* \add you do not let\add* God \add rule your lives. Neither do you
allow\add* other people \add to let God rule their lives. What you do is
like\add* not going into a \add house\add* yourselves, and not allowing others to enter it
\add either\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f*.\f +  \fk very  severely.”\f*” 
\s Matthew 23:15 
\s Jesus also warned the religious leaders about zealously encouraging others to believe what they teach.
\p
\v 15 “You are hypocrites, you men who teach the \add Jewish\add* laws and you Pharisees! Your punishment will be terrible,
because you exert yourselves very much to get \add even\add* one person to believe what you teach. For instance, you travel
across seas and lands \add to distant places\add* in order to do that. And
\add as a result\add*, when one person \add believes what you teach\add*, you make that person much more deserving to go to
hell than you yourselves \add deserve to\add*.” 
\s Matthew 23:16-22 
\s Jesus rebuked the religious leaders about their silly ideas about supporting their promises with oaths.
\p
\v 16 “You \add Jewish leaders\add*, your punishment will be terrible! You are
\add like people who are\add* blind \f + \fr metaphor \f* who are trying to lead others. You say,
‘\add In the case of\add* those who promise to \add do\add* something and then ask the Temple
\add to affirm what they have promised\add*, it means nothing \add if they do not do
what\add* they have promised. But if they ask the gold that is in the Temple
\add to affirm what they have promised\add*, they must do what they promised.’
\v 17 You are fools, and you are \add like people who are\add* blind \f + \fr metaphor \f*! The gold
\add that is in the Temple\add* is important, but \add the Temple\add* is even more important \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*, because it is the Temple
that the gold is in that sets the gold apart for a special use for God.
\v 18 Also \add you say\add*, ‘In the case of those who promise to
\add do\add* something and then ask \add the altar to affirm what they have
promised\add*, it means nothing \add if they do not do what they have
promised\add*. But if they ask the gift \add that\add* they have put on the altar
\add to support what they have promised\add*, they must do \add what they
promised\add*.’ 
\v 19  \add You are like people who are\add* blind \f + \fr metaphor \f*. The gift
\add that is offered\add* on the altar is important, but the altar is even more important \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* because it is the altar on
which the offering is offered that sets it apart for a special use for God.
\v 20 So, those who promise to do something, and then ask the altar
\add to affirm what they have promised\add* are asking everything on the
altar\add to support what they promised\add*. 
\v 21 Those who promise to do something, and then ask the Temple
\add to affirm what they promised\add*, are asking that \add God\add*, to whom the Temple belongs,
\add will affirm what they have promised\add*. 
\v 22 Those who promise to do something and then ask heaven \add to affirm what they
promised\add* are asking the throne of God and \add God\add*, who sits on that throne,
\add to affirm what they promised\add*.” 
\s Matthew 23:23-24 
\s Jesus also rebuked the religious leaders about paying attention to unimportant laws and at the same time ignoring important
ones. 
\p
\v 23 “You men who teach the \add Jewish\add* laws and you Pharisees, your punishment will be terrible! You are hypocrites
because, \add even though\add* you give \add to God\add* a tenth of
\add the herbs you produce, such as\add* mint, dill, and cummin, you do not
\add obey God's\add* laws that are more important. \add For example, you do not
act\add* justly toward others, you do not act mercifully toward people, and you are not trustworthy. It is good to
\add give a tenth of your herbs\add* to God, but you should also
\add obey\add* these other \add more important laws\add*. 
\v 24 You \add leaders are like\add* blind people \add who are trying to lead others. According to your laws you say that
touching gnats and camels makes you unacceptable to God. What you are doing is
like\add* straining a gnat \add out of a jar of water so that you do not swallow it and thereby become unacceptable to
God\add*, and \add at the same time\add* swallowing a camel \add with the
water\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f*!” 
\s Matthew 23:25-26 
\s Jesus also rebuked the religious leaders about being greedy and selfish.
\p
\v 25 “You men who teach people the \add Jewish\add* laws and you Pharisees, your punishment will be terrible! You are
hypocrites! You are greedy and selfish, but you \add make yourselves appear holy. You are
like\add* cups and plates that have been cleaned on the outside, but on the inside
\add they are very filthy\add*. 
\v 26 You blind Pharisees! First you must \add stop being greedy and
selfish\add*. \add Then you will be able to do what\add* is \add righteous. That will be
like\add* cleaning the inside of a cup first. Then when you clean \f + \fr metaphor \f* the outside
\add of the cup\add*, \add the cup will truly be clean\add*.” 
\s Matthew 23:27-28 
\s Jesus rebuked the religious leaders for being hypocrites and pretending to be righteous.
\p
\v 27 “You men who teach the \add Jewish\add* laws and you Pharisees, your punishment will be terrible! You are hypocrites! You
are like tombs \f + \fr simile \f* that are painted white \add so that people can see them and avoid touching
them\add*. The outside surfaces are beautiful, but inside they are full of dead people's bones and filth.
\v 28 You are \add like those tombs\add*. When people look at you, they think that you are righteous, but in your ◄inner
beings/hearts► you are hypocrites and you disobey \add God's\add* commands.”
\s Matthew 23:29-36 
\s Jesus accused the religious leaders of being guilty of killing all the prophets.
\p
\v 29 “You men who teach the \add Jewish\add* laws and you Pharisees are hypocrites! Your punishment will be terrible! You
rebuild the tombs of the \add prophets whom others killed long ago\add*. You decorate the monuments
\add that honor\add* righteous \add people\add*. 
\v 30 You say, ‘If we had \add lived\add* when our ancestors \f + \fr metaphor \f*
\add lived\add*, we would not have helped \f + \fr metaphor \f* those who killed \f + \fr metonymy \f* the prophets.’
\v 31 Thus \add you recognize that you should honor the prophets, but you disregard the word of God that other men whom God has
sent teach you. In that way\add* you testify against yourselves that you are descendants and disciples \f + \fr metaphor \f* of those who
killed the prophets. 
\v 32  \bd You\bd* are as ready to murder people as \f + \fr metaphor \f* your ancestors were!
\v 33  \add You people are so wicked\add*! You are \add as dangerous as
poisonous\add* snakes [DOU, MET]! ◄You \add foolishly\add* think that you will escape being punished in hell!/Do you
\add foolishly\add* think that you will escape when \add God\add* punishes
\add wicked people\add* in hell?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* 
\v 34 Take note that this is why I will send prophets, wise men, and other men who will teach you
\add my message\add*. You will kill some of them by nailing them to crosses, and you will kill some in other ways. You will
whip some of them in the places where you worship and \add you will\add* chase them from city to city.
\v 35 As a result, God will consider that you are guilty for killing \f + \fr synecdoche \f* all the righteous
\add people\add*, including killing \f + \fr metonymy \f* \add Adam's son\add* Abel, who was a righteous man \f + \fr synecdoche \f*, and Zechariah, the son of
Barachiah, whom you \add are guilty of\add* killing \add in the holy
place\add* between the Temple and the altar, and for killing \add all the
prophets\add* who lived between \add the times that those two men
lived\add*. 
\v 36 Think about this: You people who have observed my ministry, it is you whom
\add God\add* will punish \add for killing all\add* those \add prophets\add*!”
\s Matthew 23:37-39 
\s Jesus expressed his sorrow about what would happen to Jerusalem.
\p
\v 37 “O \add people of\add* Jerusalem [MTY, APO], you killed the prophets
\add who lived long ago\add*, and you killed others whom \add God\add* sent to you. You killed them by throwing stones at them
\f + \fr doublet \f*! Many times I wanted to gather you together \add to protect
you\add*, like a hen gathers her young chicks under her wings \f + \fr metaphor \f*. But you did not want
\add me to do that\add*. 
\v 38 So listen to this: Your city \f + \fr synecdoche \f* will become an uninhabited place.
\v 39 Keep this in mind: You will see me again only when I \add return\add*, and you say
\add about me\add*, ‘\add God\add* is truly pleased with this man who comes with God's authority \f + \fr metonymy \f*.’”
