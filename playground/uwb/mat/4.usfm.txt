\s Matthew 4:1-11 
\s After Jesus fasted forty days, Satan tempted him in various ways.
\p
\v 1 Then Jesus was led by the Spirit {\add God's\add* Spirit led Jesus} into a desolate area to be tempted by the devil {in
order that the devil would tempt him}. 
\v 2 After he did not eat food day and night for forty days, he was hungry.
\v 3  \add Satan\add*, the tempter, came to him and said, “Because you
\add claim that you have a relationship with\add* God \add as\add* a son
\add has with his father\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add prove it\add* by commanding these stones to become bread
\add so that you can eat them\add*!” 
\v 4 But Jesus said \add to him\add*, “\add No! I will not change stones into bread,
because\add* it is written \add in the Scriptures\add* {in the Scriptures\add Moses\add* wrote},
\add ‘Eating\add* food \f + \ft synecdoche \f* \add sustains\add* people \add physically,
but\add* it does not sustain them \add spiritually\add* \f + \ft synecdoche \f*. Instead,
\add paying attention to\add* everything that God has spoken \add to them is what sustains people
spiritually\add*.’” 
\v 5 Then the devil took Jesus to \add Jerusalem\add*, the city that is dedicated to God. He set him on the highest part of the
Temple, 
\v 6 and said to him, “Because you \add claim that you have a relationship
with\add* God \add as\add* a son \add has with his father, prove it
by\add* jumping down \add to the ground. You will not be hurt\add*, because it is written
\add in the Scriptures\add*, \add ‘God\add* will command his angels to protect you. They will lift you up in their hands
\add when you are falling\add*, in order that \add you will not get
hurt\add*. You will not \add even\add* strike your foot on a stone.’”
\v 7 But Jesus said, “\add No! I\add* will not\add jump down, because\add* in another place
\add in the Scriptures\add* it is written {there are these words that
\add Moses\add* wrote}: ‘Do not \add try to\add* test the Lord your God
\add to see if he will prevent something bad from happening to you when you do something
foolish!\add*’” 
\v 8 Then the devil took him on \add top of\add* a very high mountain. There he showed him all the nations in the world and the
magnificent things in those nations. 
\v 9 And then he said to him, “I will \add let you rule all these nations
and\add* give you the magnificent things in them if you bow down and worship me.”
\v 10 But Jesus said to him, “\add No, I will not worship you\add*, Satan,
\add so\add* go away! It is written in the Scriptures, ‘It is the Lord your God whom
you\add (pl)\add* must worship, and you\add (pl)\add* must serve only him!’”
\v 11 Then the devil went away, and right away, angels came to Jesus and took care of him.
\s Matthew 4:12-17 
\s Jesus went to Galilee and preached that people needed to repent to belong to the group whom God would consider his people.
\p
\v 12  \add While\add* Jesus \add was in Judea, John the Baptizer's
disciples\add* told him that John had been put in prison and kept there {that
\add Herod Antipas\add* had put John \add the Baptizer\add* in prison
\add and kept him there\add*}. \add So\add* Jesus returned to Galilee
\add District\add*. While he was in Galilee, he first went to Nazareth town.
\v 13 Then he left Nazareth and went to Capernaum \add city in order to live there. Capernaum is located beside Galilee Lake in
the region which was formerly\add* the regions of \add the tribes
of\add* Zebulun and Naphtali. 
\v 14  \add One reason that he went there\add* was so that \add these
words\add* that were written by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled {so that he might fulfill these words that the prophet
Isaiah wrote}: 
\p
\v 15 Zebulun \add region\add* and Naphtali \add region are on\add* the road
\add which is\add* near \add Galilee Lake and\add* on the eastern side of the Jordan
\add River. They are\add* the regions in Galilee \add District where
many\add* non-Jews \add are living\add*. 
\v 16  \add Although the people there will be like\add* people who sit in a dark place \f + \ft metaphor \f*,
\add they will suddenly perceive clearly a new teaching, as\add* people who have seen a big light shining on them \f + \ft metaphor \f*
perceive everything clearly\add . The\add* people who are located in a dangerous \f + \ft metaphor \f* region
\add will suddenly perceive clearly what God teaches\add*, as people on whom a light shines perceive things clearly \f + \ft metaphor, doublet \f*.
\p
\v 17 From that time, \add while\add* Jesus was \add in Capernaum city, he began to preach this to people: “God [MTY\f + \ft Or: EUP \f*] will
very soon begin to rule, and he will judge you when he rules\add*. So
you\add (pl)\add* need to turn from your sinful ways \add so that God will not punish
you\add*.” 
\s Matthew 4:18-23 
\s Jesus summoned four fishermen, who immediately left their work and went with him.
\p
\v 18  \add One day\add* while Jesus was walking by Galilee Lake, he saw two men, Simon, who was
\add later\add* called Peter, and Andrew, his \add younger\add* brother. They were casting their
\add fishing\add* net into the lake because they \add earned money
by\add* catching\add and selling\add* fish. 
\v 19 He said to them, “\add Just like you have been\add* gathering fish, come with me and I will teach you how to gather
people \add to become my disciples\add*.” \f + \ft metaphor \f* 
\v 20 They immediately left \add the work that they were doing with\add* their
\add fishing\add* nets, and they went with him. 
\p
\v 21 As \add the three of them\add* walked on from there, Jesus saw two other men, James, and John, the
\add younger\add* brother of James. \add They were\add* in their boat with Zebedee, their father, mending their
\add fishing\add* nets. Jesus told them that \add they should leave their work
and\add* go with him. 
\v 22 They immediately left their fishing boat and their father, and they went with Jesus.
\s Matthew 4:23-25 
\s Jesus taught and healed many people when he was in Galilee District.
\p
\v 23 Jesus went \add with those four men\add* throughout all of Galilee
\add District\add*. He was teaching \add the people\add* in the buildings where we Jews worship God. He was preaching the good
message that tells how to become members of the group of people whose lives God rules over. He was also healing all
\add the Galileans\add* who had diseases or who were sick. 
\v 24 When people who lived in other parts of Syria \add District\add* heard \f + \ft personification \f* what he was doing, they brought to him
people who suffered from illnesses, people who suffered from many kinds of diseases, people who
\add suffered from\add* severe pains, people who were controlled by demons {whom demons controlled}, people who were
epileptics, and people who were paralyzed. And Jesus healed them.
\v 25 Then crowds started to go with him. \add They were people from\add* Galilee
\add District\add*, from the Decapolis\f + \ft Or: from the Ten Towns \add area\add* \f*, from Jerusalem
\add city\add*, from other \add parts of\add* Judea \add district\add*, and from areas east of the Jordan
\add River\add*.
