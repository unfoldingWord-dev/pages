\s A psalm written by David for the choir director 
\q
\v 1 Yahweh, how long will you continue to forget about me [RHQ]?
\q2 Will you hide yourself [SYN] from me forever? 
\q
\v 2 How long must I endure anguish/worry within myself? 
\q2 Must I be miserable/sad every day? 
\q2 How long will my enemies continue to defeat me? 
\b
\q
\v 3 Yahweh my God, look at me and answer me. 
\q2 Enable me to become strong again [IDI], and do not allow me to die.
\q
\v 4 Do not allow my enemies \add to boast and\add* to say, “We have defeated him!”
\q2 Do not allow them to defeat me, 
\q2 with the result that they will rejoice about it! 
\b
\q
\v 5 But I trust that you will faithfully love me; 
\q2 I will rejoice when you rescue me. 
\q
\v 6 Yahweh, you have done many good things for me, 
\q2 so I will sing to you.
