\c 88  
\s A psalm that expresses sadness, written for the choir director by Zerah's son Heman, one of the descendants of Korah
\q
\v 1 Yahweh God, you who rescues me, all during each day I call out
\add to you\add* to help me, 
\q and I cry out to you during each night also. 
\q
\v 2 Listen [IDI] to my prayer [DOU], 
\q2 while I cry out to you \add for help\add*! 
\b
\q
\v 3 I have experienced many troubles/difficulties, 
\q2 and I am about to die [MTY] and go where dead people are. 
\q
\v 4 Because I have no more strength, 
\q2 \add other people also\add* consider that I will soon die. 
\q
\v 5 I am like a corpse that has been abandoned; 
\q2 I am like dead people who lie in their graves, 
\q2 people who have been completely forgotten, 
\q2 because you do not take care of them anymore. 
\b
\q
\v 6  \add It is as though\add* you have thrown me into a deep, dark pit,
\q2 into a place where they throw corpses. 
\q
\v 7  \add It seems like\add* you are very angry with me, 
\q and \add it is as though\add* you have crushed me like \add ocean\add* waves
\add crash down on people\add* [MET]. 
\qr (Think about that!) 
\q
\v 8 You have caused my friends to ◄avoid/stay away from► me; 
\q2 I have become repulsive to them. 
\q \add It is as though\add* I am in a prison and cannot escape.
\q
\v 9 My eyes cannot see well because I cry very much. 
\q2 Yahweh, every day I call out to you \add to help me\add*; 
\q2 I lift up my hands to you \add while I pray\add*. 
\b
\q
\v 10 You certainly do not [RHQ] perform miracles for dead people!
\q Their spirits do not [RHQ] arise to praise you! 
\qr (Think about that!) 
\q
\v 11 Corpses in the grave certainly do not tell about your faithfully loving us [RHQ],
\q2 and in the place where people are finally destroyed, 
\q2 no one tells about what you faithfully \add do for us\add* [RHQ].
\q
\v 12 No one in the deep dark pit ever sees the miracles that you perform [RHQ],
\q2 and no one in the place where people have been completely forgotten tells about your being good to us.
\b
\q
\v 13 But as for me, Yahweh, I cry out to you \add to help me\add*;
\q2 each morning I pray to you. 
\q
\v 14 Yahweh, why do you reject me? 
\q2 Why do you turn away from me? 
\b
\q
\v 15 All the time since I was young, I have suffered and have often almost died;
\q I am ◄in despair/very discouraged► because of enduring the terrible things that you have done to me.
\q
\v 16  \add I feel that\add* you have crushed me because of your being angry with me;
\q2 the terrible things that you are doing to me are almost destroying me.
\q
\v 17  \add I feel as though\add* they surround me like a flood [SIM];
\q2 they are ◄closing in on/crushing► me from all sides. 
\q
\v 18 You have caused even my friends and others whom I love to avoid me,
\q2 and \add it is as though\add* the only friend that I have is darkness.
