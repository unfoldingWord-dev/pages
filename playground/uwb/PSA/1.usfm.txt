\c 1  
\s The people God is pleased with 
\q
\v 1  \add Yahweh\add* is pleased with those who do not do what the [MET] wicked people advise them to do,
\q2 and who do not imitate the behavior of [MET] of sinful people,
\q and who do not join with people who ◄ridicule/sneer at► \add God\add*.
\q
\v 2 Those whom God is pleased with delight in doing the things that Yahweh has instructed/taught us to do.
\q2 They read and think about Yahweh's requirements every day and every night.
\q
\v 3 They \add constantly produce/do things that please God\add*
\q2 just like fruit trees that have been planted along the banks of a stream produce fruit at the right time every year.
\q Like trees that never wither, 
\q2 they succeed in everything that they do. 
\b
\q
\v 4 But wicked people are not like that! 
\q2 Wicked people are as worthless as chaff 
\q2 that is blown away by the wind. 
\q
\v 5 Therefore, wicked people ◄will not be acquitted/will be condemned► [LIT] when
\add God\add* judges people, 
\q2 and furthermore, sinful people will not even be present when God gathers righteous people together,
\q
\v 6 because Yahweh guides and protects righteous people, 
\q2 but the path that the wicked walk on leads them to where they will be destroyed/punished
\add by God forever\add*.
