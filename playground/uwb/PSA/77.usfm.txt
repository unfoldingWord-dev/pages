\c 77  
\s A psalm written by Asaph for Jeduthun, the choir director 
\q
\v 1 I cry out to God; 
\q I cry aloud to him, and he hears me. 
\q
\v 2 At the times when I have trouble, I pray to the Lord; 
\q2 all during the night I lift up my hands while I pray, 
\q2 but nothing causes me to be comforted. 
\b
\q
\v 3 When I think about God, I ◄despair/think that he will never help me►;
\q when I meditate about him, I am discouraged. 
\qr (Think about that!) 
\q
\v 4  \add All during the night\add* he prevents me from sleeping;
\q2 I am very worried, with the result that I do not know what to say.
\q
\v 5 I think about days that have passed; 
\q2 I remember \add what happened in\add* previous years. 
\q
\v 6 I spend all the night thinking \add about things\add*; 
\q2 I meditate, and this is what I ask myself: 
\q
\v 7 “Will the Lord always reject us? 
\q2 Will he never again be pleased with us? 
\q
\v 8 Has he stopped faithfully loving us? 
\q Will he not do for us what he promised to do? 
\q
\v 9 God promised to act mercifully toward us; has he forgotten that?
\q2 Because he is angry with us, has he decided to not be kind to us?”
\qr (Think about that!) 
\q
\v 10 Then I said, “What causes me to be very sad is that 
\q \add it seems that\add* God, who is greater than any other god, is no longer powerful.”
\b
\q
\v 11 But then, Yahweh, I recall/remember your great deeds; 
\q2 I remember the wonderful things that you did in the past. 
\q2
\v 12 I meditate on all that you have done, 
\q2 and I think about your mighty acts. 
\b
\q
\v 13 God, everything that you do is holy; 
\q2 there is certainly no god [RHQ] who is great like you are! 
\q
\v 14 You are God, the one who performs miracles; 
\q2 you showed to the people of many people-groups that you are powerful.
\q
\v 15 By your power [MTY] you rescued your people \add from Egypt\add*;
\q2 you saved those who were descendants of Jacob and \add his son\add* Joseph.
\qr (Think about that!) 
\b
\q
\v 16  \add It was as though\add* the waters \add of the Red Sea\add* saw you and became very afraid,
\q2 and even the deepest part of the water shook. 
\q
\v 17 Rain poured down from the clouds [PRS]; 
\q2 it thundered very loudly [PRS], 
\q2 and lightning flashed in all directions. 
\q
\v 18 Thunder crashed in the whirlwind, 
\q2 and lightning ◄lit up/flashed in► the entire sky [HYP]; 
\q the earth shook violently [DOU]. 
\q
\v 19 Then you walked through the sea 
\q2 on a path that you made through the deep water, 
\q2 but your footprints could not be seen. 
\b
\q
\v 20 You led your people like \add a shepherd leads his\add* flock
\add of sheep\add*, 
\q2 while Moses and Aaron were the leaders \add of your people\add*.
