\c 129  
\s A psalm written for people going up to the temple to worship 
\q
\v 1  \add I say that\add* my enemies have ◄afflicted/caused trouble for► me ever since I was young.
\q \add Now I request you, my fellow\add* Israelis, to repeat those same words:
\q
\v 2 “Our enemies have afflicted us since our nation began, 
\q2 but they have not defeated us! 
\q
\v 3  \add Our enemies struck us with whips\add* that cut into our backs [MET]
\q2 like a \add farmer uses a\add* plow to cuts deep furrows into the ground.”
\q
\v 4 But Yahweh is righteous, 
\q2 and he has freed me from being a slave [MTY] of wicked people.
\b
\q
\v 5 I wish/hope that all those who hate Jerusalem/Israel will be ashamed because of being defeated.
\q
\v 6 I hope/wish that they will be \add of no value\add*, like grass that grows on the roofs of houses
\q2 that dries up and does not grow tall; 
\q
\v 7 as a result no one \add cuts it and\add* puts it in bundles and carries it away
\add to thatch a roof with it\add*. 
\q
\v 8 People who pass by \add and see men harvesting grain usually greet them by saying to
them\add*, 
\q2 “We wish/hope that Yahweh will bless you!” 
\q But this will not happen \add to those who hate Israel\add* 
\q2 \add because they will not harvest any grain\add*. 
\q We, acting as Yahweh's representatives, bless you \add Israelis\add*!
