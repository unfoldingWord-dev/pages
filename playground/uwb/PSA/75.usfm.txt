\c 75  
\s A psalm written by Asaph for the choir director, to be sung using the tune 'Do not destroy'
\q
\v 1 We give thanks to you; 
\q2 our God, we thank you. 
\q You are close to us, 
\q2 and we proclaim to others the wonderful things that you have done
\add for us\add*. 
\b
\q
\v 2  \add You have said\add*, “I have appointed a time when I will judge people,
\q2 and I will judge \add everyone\add* fairly. 
\q
\v 3 When the earth shakes 
\q2 and all the creatures on the earth tremble, 
\q I am the one who will ◄keep its foundations steady/prevent it from being destroyed►.
\qr (Think about that!) 
\q
\v 4 I say to people who ◄boast/talk proudly about themselves►, ‘Stop bragging!’
\q and I say to wicked people, ‘Do not proudly \add do things to\add* show how great you are [IDI]!
\q
\v 5 Do not be arrogant, 
\q2 and do not speak so boastfully!’ ” 
\b
\q
\v 6 The one who judges people does not come from the east or from the west,
\q and he does not come from the desert. 
\q
\v 7 God is the one who judges people; 
\q2 he says that some have sinned and must be punished and that others have not done what is wrong.
\q
\v 8  \add It is as though\add* Yahweh holds a cup in his hand; 
\q2 it is filled with wine that \add has spices\add* mixed in it
\add to cause those who drink it to become more drunk\add*; 
\q and when Yahweh pours it out, he will force all the wicked people to drink it;
\q2 they will drink every drop of it, 
\q2 \add which means that he will give them all the punishment that they
deserve\add*. 
\b
\q
\v 9 But as for me, I will never stop saying what the God whom Jacob
\add worshiped has done\add*; 
\q I will never quit singing to praise him. 
\q
\v 10 He will get rid of the power [IDI] of wicked people, 
\q but he will increase the power of righteous people.
