\c 66  
\s A psalm which is a song for the choir director 
\q
\v 1  \add Tell\add* everyone on the earth 
\q2 that they should sing joyfully to praise God! 
\q
\v 2 They should sing songs that say that God [MTY] is very great,
\q2 and they should tell everyone that he is very glorious! 
\q
\v 3 They should say to God, “The things that you do are awesome!
\q2 Your power is very great, 
\q2 with the result that your enemies ◄cringe/bow down► in front of you.”
\q
\v 4 Everyone on the earth \add should\add* worship God 
\q2 and sing to praise him 
\q2 and honor him [MTY]. 
\qr (Think about that!) 
\b
\q
\v 5 Come and think about what God has done! 
\q Think about the awesome things that he has done among people.
\q
\v 6 He caused the \add Red\add* Sea to become dry land, 
\q2 with the result that our ancestors were able to walk right through it.
\q There we rejoiced because of what he \add had done\add*. 
\q
\v 7 He rules forever by his power, 
\q2 and he keeps watching all the \add pagan\add* nations \add to see what evil things they
do\add*, 
\q2 so those nations that want to rebel \add against him\add* should not be proud.
\qr (Think about that!) 
\b
\q
\v 8 You people \add of all nations\add*, praise our God! 
\q2 Praise him loudly in order that people will hear you as you praise him.
\q
\v 9 He has kept us alive, 
\q2 and he has not allowed us to ◄stumble/be defeated►. 
\b
\q
\v 10 God, you have tested us; 
\q you have allowed us to experience great difficulties \add to make our lives become
pure\add* 
\q2 as people put precious metals in a hot fire \add to burn out what is
impure\add* [MET]. 
\q
\v 11  \add It is as if\add* you allowed us to fall into traps [MET],
\q2 and you \add forced us to endure difficult things which were
like\add* putting heavy loads on our backs [MET]. 
\q
\v 12 You allowed our enemies to trample on us; 
\q2 we \add experienced difficulties/troubles that were like\add* [MET] walking through fires and floods,
\q but now you have brought us into a place where ◄we are safe/we have plenty►.
\b
\q
\v 13 I will bring to your temple offerings that are to be completely burned
\add on the altar\add*; 
\q2 I will offer to you what I promised. 
\q
\v 14 When I was experiencing much trouble, I said that I would bring offerings to you
\add if you rescued me\add*; 
\q2 \add and you did rescue me, so\add* I will bring to you what I promised.
\q
\v 15 I will bring sheep to be burned on the altar, 
\q2 and I will also sacrifice bulls and goats, 
\q2 and when they are burning, \add you will be pleased when\add* the smoke
\add rises up\add* ◄\add to you/to the sky\add*►. 
\qr (Think about that!) 
\b
\q
\v 16 All you people who have a reverential respect for God, come and listen,
\q2 and I will tell you what he has done for me. 
\q
\v 17 I called out to him to help me, 
\q2 and I praised him while I was speaking to him [MTY]. 
\q
\v 18 If I had ignored the sins that I had committed, 
\q2 the Lord would not have paid any attention to me. 
\q
\v 19 But because \add I confessed my sins\add*, God has listened to me
\q2 and he paid attention to my prayers. 
\q
\v 20 I praise God 
\q2 because he has not ignored my prayers 
\q2 or stopped faithfully loving me.
