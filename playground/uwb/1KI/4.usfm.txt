\s Solomon's kingdom 
\p
\v 20 There were as many people in Judah and Israel as there are grains of sand [HYP] on the seashore. They
\add had plenty to\add* eat and drink and they were happy. 
\v 21 Solomon's kingdom extended from the Euphrates \add River in the
northeast\add* to the Philistia \add area in the west\add* and to the border of Egypt
\add in the south\add*. The \add conquered\add* people in those areas paid taxes and were under Solomon's control all during
his life. 
\p
\v 22  \add The people whom Solomon ruled\add* were required to bring to Solomon every day 150 bushels of fine flour and 300
bushels of wheat, 
\v 23 ten cattle that were kept in stalls/barns, twenty cattle that were kept in pastures, 100 sheep, and ◄deer and gazelles
and roebucks/three kinds of deer►, and poultry. 
\v 24 Solomon ruled over all the area west of the Euphrates \add River\add*, from Tiphsah
\add city\add* \add in the northeast\add* to Gaza \add city in the
southwest\add*. He ruled over all the kings in that area. And there was peace between his
\add government\add* and the \add governments of\add* nearby countries.
\v 25 All during the years that Solomon ruled, the people of Judah and Israel lived safely. Each family had its own grapevines
and fig trees. 
\p
\v 26 Solomon had 4,000 stalls for the horses \add that pulled\add* his chariots and 12,000 men who rode on horses (OR, in the
chariots). 
\p
\v 27 His twelve governors supplied the food that King Solomon needed for himself and for all those who ate in the palace. Each
governor supplied food for one month each year. They provided everything [LIT] that Solomon required.
\v 28 They also brought \add stalks of\add* barley and wheat for the fast horses
\add that pulled the chariots\add* and for the \add other work\add* horses. They brought it to the places where the horses were
kept. 
\s Solomon's wisdom 
\p
\v 29 God enabled Solomon to be extremely wise and to have great insight/understanding. He ◄was interested in/enjoyed learning
about► a huge number of things. 
\v 30 He was wiser than all the wise men in Arabia and Mesopotamia and all the wise men in Egypt.
\v 31 Ethan from Ezrah and Heman and Calcol and Darda and the sons of Mahol were
\add considered to be\add* very wise, but Solomon was wiser than all of them. People in all the nearby countries heard about
Solomon. 
\v 32 He composed/wrote 3,000 ◄proverbs/wise sayings► and more than 1,000 songs.
\v 33 He talked about various kinds of plants, from the \add huge\add* cedar trees in Lebanon to the
\add tiny\add* hyssop plants that grow in cracks in walls. He also talked about wild animals and birds and reptiles and fish.
\v 34 People came from all over the world to hear the wise things that Solomon said. Many kings sent men to listen to him
\add and then return and tell them what Solomon said\add*.
