\c 19  
\s Elijah fled to the desert and then to Sinai Mountain 
\p
\v 1 When Ahab got home, he told \add his wife\add* Jezebel what Elijah had done. He told her that Elijah had killed all the
prophets of Baal. 
\v 2 So Jezebel sent this message to Elijah: “By this time tomorrow I will have
\add killed\add* you, just like you \add killed all those prophets of
Baal\add*. If I do not do that, I hope the gods will kill me.” 
\p
\v 3 When Elijah \add received her message\add*, he was afraid. So
\add taking his servant with him\add*, he fled in order that he would not be killed. He went
\add far south\add* to Beersheba, in Judah. He left his servant there.
\v 4 Then he went by himself further \add south\add* into the desert. He walked all day. He sat down under a broom tree and
prayed that \add Yahweh\add* would allow him to die. He said, “Yahweh, I cannot endure anymore. So allow me to die, because for
me to live is no better than \add being with\add* my ancestors \add who have
died\add*.” 
\p
\v 5 Then he lay down under the broom tree and slept. But while he was sleeping, an angel touched him and
\add woke him up and\add* said to him, “Get up and eat some food!”
\p
\v 6 Elijah looked around and saw some bread which had been baked on hot stones, and he also saw a jar of water. So he ate some
bread and drank some water and lay down \add to sleep\add* again.
\p
\v 7 Then the angel \add who had been sent by\add* Yahweh came again and touched him, and said, “Get up and eat some
\add more\add* food, because you need \add more strength\add* to go on a long journey.”
\v 8 So he got up and ate and drank some more, and because of doing that, he got enough strength to enable him to travel for
forty days and nights to Sinai Mountain, the mountain \add that was dedicated
to\add* God. 
\v 9 He went into a cave there and slept there that night. 
\s Yahweh gave instructions to Elijah 
\p \add The next morning\add*, Yahweh said to him “Elijah, why are you here?”
\v 10 Elijah replied, “I have zealously served you, Yahweh, God Almighty. But the Israeli people have rejected the agreement
that they made with you. They have torn down your altars, and they have killed all of your prophets. I am the only one whom
they have not killed, and now they are trying to kill me, too. \add So I am running away from
them\add*.” 
\p
\v 11 Yahweh said to him, “Go out and stand in front of me on this mountain while I pass by.”
\add So Elijah did that\add*. While he was standing there, a strong windstorm struck the mountain. As a result, rocks were
loosened from the mountainside. But Yahweh was not in the wind. Then there was an earthquake, but Yahweh was not in the
earthquake. 
\p
\v 12 Then there was a fire, but Yahweh was not in the fire. Then there was a sound like someone whispering quietly.
\v 13 When Elijah heard that, he wrapped his cloak around his face. He went out of the cave and stood at its entrance. And he
heard Yahweh speaking to him, saying again, “Elijah, why are you here?”
\p
\v 14 He replied again, “I have zealously served you, Yahweh, God Almighty. But the Israeli people have rejected the agreement
that they made with you. They have torn down your altars, and they have killed all of your prophets. I am the only one whom
they have not killed, and now they are trying to kill me, too. \add So I am running away from
them\add*.” 
\p
\v 15 Then Yahweh told him, “Go back to the desert near Damascus. When you arrive there, anoint
\add with olive oil\add* a man named Hazael, \add to appoint him\add* to be the king of Syria.
\v 16 Then anoint Jehu, the son of Nimshi, to be the king of Israel, and also anoint Elisha the son of Shaphat, from
Abel-Meholah \add town\add*, to become my prophet after you are gone.
\v 17 Hazael's army \add will kill many people, and\add* those who escape from
\add being killed by\add* his army will be killed by Jehu's \add army\add*, and those who escape from
\add being killed by\add* Jehu's army will be killed by Elisha. 
\v 18 But \add you need to know that\add* there are still 7,000 people in Israel who have never bowed to
\add worship\add* Baal or kissed his \add idol\add*.” 
\s Elijah summoned Elisha 
\p
\v 19 So Elijah went \add to Syria\add* and found Elisha as he was plowing a field with a team of oxen. There were eleven other
men who were in front of him, plowing with teams of oxen in the same field. Elijah went to Elisha, and took off his own coat
and put it on Elisha, \add to show Elisha that he wanted Elisha to take his place as a prophet. Then he started to walk
away\add*. 
\v 20 Elisha left the oxen standing there and ran after Elijah, and said to him, “I will go with you, but first let me kiss my
parents goodbye.” 
\p Elijah replied, “Okay, go home. But do not forget why I have \add given my
cloak\add* to you!” 
\v 21 So Elisha went back \add home\add*. He killed his oxen \add and cut them in
pieces\add* and used the wood from the plow to build a fire to roast the meat. He distributed the meat to the other people
\add in his town\add*, and they all ate some. Then he went with Elijah and became his helper.
