\v 1  \add I\add*, Paul, \add am writing this letter. I am\add* an apostle whom Christ Jesus chose so that I would do what God
wanted. He chose me \add to tell people that God\add* has promised
\add that they will\add* live \add eternally\add* as a result of their having a close relationship with Christ Jesus.
\v 2  \add I am writing to you\add*, Timothy, whom I love \add as if you
were\add* my own son. \add I pray that\add* God our Father and Christ Jesus our Lord will
\add continue to act\add* kindly to you, be merciful to you, and
\add cause you to have\add* inner peace, 
\s 2 Timothy 1:3-5 
\s I thank God that you sincerely believe in Christ Jesus. 
\p
\v 3 I thank God \add for all that he has done for you\add*. I serve him, and my ancestors
\add served him, too. I serve him\add* in a manner that I know to be right.
\add I thank him\add* while repeatedly I \add pray for you\add* at night and during the day.
\v 4  \add While I am thanking God for you\add*, I very much want to see you because I remember how you cried \f + \ft metonymy \f*
\add when we separated. I want to see you\add* in order that I may be filled with joy\f + \ft Or: very happy \f*.
\v 5  \add I thank God because\add* I remember that you sincerely believe
\add in Christ Jesus\add*. First, your grandmother, Lois, and your mother, Eunice,
\add believed in him and\add*, I am convinced\f + \ft Or: very sure \f* that you also believe in him.
\s 2 Timothy 1:6-7 
\s So I remind you to do fervently what God has enabled and assigned you to do.
\p
\v 6 Because \add I am sure that you believe in him\add*, I remind you to do fervently\f + \ft Or: wholeheartedly \f* \f + \ft metaphor \f* what God has
assigned for\f + \ft Or: appointed \f* you to do and what he has enabled you to do.
\add God\add* \add assigned for\f + \ft Or: appointed\add* \f* you to do it as a result of my putting my hands
\add on you to show\f + \ft Or: indicate \f* that he had chosen you to do his work\add*.
\v 7 Remember that God has put \add his Spirit\add* within us\add . His Spirit does not cause us to
be\add* afraid. Instead, \add he causes us to be\add* powerful \add to work for
God\add*, and he helps us to love \add others\add* and \add to\add* control what we say and do.
\s 2 Timothy 1:8-14 
\s Never be ashamed either of the message or of me, but be willing to endure with me whatever we suffer because we tell the
good news. 
\p
\v 8 So never be ashamed\f + \ft Or: reluctant \f* to tell others the message about our Lord. And do not
\add be ashamed\add* of me, \add even though I am\add* a prisoner
\add because I preach about\add* him. Instead, \add be willing to\add* suffer as I do as you proclaim the message about Christ.
\add Endure what you will suffer\add* by letting God empower \add you to endure
it\add*. 
\v 9  \add God\add* saved us and chose us to conduct our lives in a pure way. It was not our doing good deeds\f + \ft Or: actions \f*
\add that caused him to do this for us—something\add* that we did not deserve. Instead, before ◄time began\f + \ft Or: he \f* created the
world► he purposed\f + \ft Or: planned \f* to \add be kind to us\add* as a result of what Christ Jesus
\add would do for us\add*. 
\v 10 Now, as a result of our Savior Christ Jesus having come, it has been revealed {he has shown}
\add that he acts kindly toward us. Specifically, Christ Jesus\add* has declared that we
\add will not remain dead after we\add* die! He has also revealed that, as a result of
\add our hearing and accepting\add* the message \add about Christ,
we\add* will live \add forever in bodies that will\add* not decay!
\v 11 I was chosen {Christ chose me} to go as an apostle to many places and proclaim that message to people.
\v 12 So, even though I suffer \add here in this prison\add*, I am not ashamed
\add of being here\add* \f + \ft Or: I am very confident), because I know
\add Christ Jesus\add*, the one whom I have trusted, and I am convinced\f + \ft Or: sure \f* that he is able to keep safe the good message that
he has entrusted to me (OR, the things that I have entrusted \add to
him\add* \f*, and that he will reward me at the time \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add when he comes
again\add*. 
\p
\v 13 Be sure that you tell others the same correct message that you heard from me.
\add And as you tell it\add*, keep trusting \add in Christ Jesus\add* and keep loving
\add others\add* as Christ Jesus \add enables you to do\add*. 
\v 14 Do not let anyone persuade you to change the \add good message
that\add* God has entrusted\f + \ft Or: given \f* to you. Allow the Holy Spirit who lives in us to
\add direct what you say\add*. 
\s 2 Timothy 1:15-18 
\s Many people have turned away from me, but Onesiphorus often refreshed me and was not ashamed of me.
\p
\v 15 You know that \add almost\add* all \add the believers\add* in Asia
\add province\add* have turned away from\f + \ft Or: abandoned \f* me, including Phygelus and Hermogenes.
\v 16  \add But I pray that\add* the Lord will be kind to the family of Onesiphorus for the following reasons: Often he
refreshed me and, \add even though\add* I was a prisoner \f + \ft metonymy \f*, he was not ashamed of
me\f + \ft Or: \add to admit he was\add* my \add friend\add* \f*. 
\v 17 On the contrary, when he came here to Rome \add city\add*, he diligently searched for me until he found me.
\v 18  \add I pray that\add* the Lord will be kind to him in that day \f + \ft metonymy \f*
\add when he, the Lord, will judge people\add*. And how much Onesiphorus served
\add me\add* in Ephesus \add city\add*, you know very well.
