\c 3  
\s 2 Timothy 3:1-9 
\s Realize that evil people will cause the last days to be difficult. Avoid such people.
\p
\v 1  \add You need to\add* realize that during the last days \f + \ft metonymy \f*
\add before Christ returns, evil people will make\add* it difficult
\add for believers to behave as they should\add*. 
\v 2 This is because \add such evil\add* people will be habitually loving themselves and loving money. They will habitually
boast \add about themselves\add*, they will be proud, and will often say bad things
\add about others. They\add* will disobey \add their\add* parents. They will not be thankful, nor will they respect
\add anything that is good\add*. 
\v 3 They will not \add even\add* love their own family, nor agree with
\add anybody\add* \f + \ft Or: \add they never forgive anyone\add* \f*. They will tell lies about people. They will not control what they
say and do, nor allow anyone to control them. They will not love
\add anything that is\add* good. 
\v 4 They will betray others\f + \ft Or: hand others over to their enemies \f* and act foolishly. They will be overly, Or: very proud of
themselves, and they will love to please themselves instead of loving God.
\v 5  \add And, although they will\add* pretend that they worship God, they will not let
\add God's Spirit\add* work powerfully \add in their lives\add*. Do not associate with such people \f + \ft Or: Do not let such people
join \add your congregation\add* \f*, 
\v 6 because some such \add people, even now\add*, subtly\f + \ft Or: deceivingly \f* persuade foolish women to let them come into their
houses, and then they deceive those women \add so that they control what those women think. These
women\add* have been burdened with sins {have sinned very much} and they have been led to do {they do} the many
\add evil\add* things that they strongly desire to do. 
\v 7  \add Even though\add* they are always \add wanting to\add* learn new things, they are never able to recognize what is
true. 
\v 8 Just like Jannes and Jambres \add long ago\add* very much opposed Moses, so also some
\add people\add* now oppose the true \add message. Those\add* people think only what is evil. God rejects them
\add because they do not\add* believe \add what is true\add*. 
\v 9 Nevertheless, they will not continue to succeed, because most \f + \ft hyperbole \f* people will understand clearly that such people are
foolish, just like people also realized \add clearly that Jannes and Jambres were
foolish\add*. 
\s 2 Timothy 3:10-17 
\s Continue to believe what you have learned and been assured of.
\p
\v 10 But as for yourself, you have fully known what I have taught. You have known
\add and imitated\add* the way in which I conducted my life, \add and\add* what I have been trying to do.
\add You have\add* trusted \add God as\add* I have\add You have been\add* patient as I have been.
\add You have\add* loved people \add as\add* I have and \add you
have\add* endured \add as you suffered like\add* I have \add suffered\add*.
\v 11  \add You know how I endured many times when people\add* harmed
me\add . They\add* caused me to suffer at Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra
\add cities\add*. \add But although they caused me to suffer\add*, I endured it; and every time
\add they\add* did those things to me, the Lord rescued me. 
\v 12 Indeed\f + \ft Or: You know that \f*, for us\add (inc)\add* who want to live in a
\add godly manner\f + \ft Or: \add*in a \add manner that pleases God\add* \f*, we will always be persecuted {there will always be people who
will cause us to suffer} because we \add have a close relationship
with\add* Christ Jesus. 
\v 13 Evil people \f + \ft Or: And those \f* who deceive other people will get worse\f + \ft Or: teach things that are more and more wrong \f*.
\add Specifically, they will\add* deceive other people, and \add those who hear them
will\add* deceive others. 
\v 14 But you, in contrast, must continue \add to believe\add* what you have learned and been assured of\f + \ft Or: firmly believe \f*.
\add I know that you are confident\f + \ft Or: sure \f* that it is true because\add* you know that you have learned it from all
\add of us who taught you\add* \add God's truth\f + \ft Or: what is right\add* \f*.
\v 15 From \add the time when you were\add* a child you have known the holy writings\f + \ft Or: Scriptures \f*.
\add You now know that\add* they enabled you to become wise so that God saved you because of your believing in Christ Jesus.
\v 16 God inspired\f + \ft Or: put into men's minds \f* everything \add that is
written\add* in the Scriptures {they \add wrote\add* in the holy writings}, and those writings are all useful to teach
\add us what is true\add*, to cause us to know \add when we are\add* wrong and then to correct us\f + \ft Or: to show us what we have done
that is wrong \f*, and to train\f + \ft Or: teach \f* us to do what is right. 
\v 17 What \add is written\add* {they wrote} is useful to help us who
\add serve\add* God to be ready\f + \ft Or: prepared \f* to do all that we should do. By means of it, we are equipped {God gives us what we
need} in order to do every \add kind of\add* good deeds.
