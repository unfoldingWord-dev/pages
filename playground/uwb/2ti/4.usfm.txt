\s 2 Timothy 4:1-8 
\s I solemnly charge you to preach the true message and do everything that you ought to do.
\p
\v 1 Christ Jesus \add is going to come back and\add* judge those who are living
\add when he comes\add* and those who will have died. He will judge them
\add concerning what rewards they deserve, and\add* he will rule everyone. So,
\add knowing that\add* he and God are watching \add everything that we
do\add*, I solemnly\f + \ft Or: earnestly \f* command you 
\v 2 that you proclaim the \add true\add* message to people. Always be ready\f + \ft Or: prepared \f*
\add to proclaim it\add* whether people want to hear it or not. \add Some people are saying things that are not
correct\add*; ◄refute their teaching\f + \ft Or: show \f* why their teaching is wrong►. Rebuke them when they are doing wrong. Tell them what
they ought to do. Be very patient while you teach them. 
\v 3  \add Do these things\add* because there will be a time when people will not listen to good teaching. Instead, they will
bring in many teachers for themselves who will tell them just what they want to hear \\f + \\ft idiom \\f*.
\add The reason that they will bring in such teachers is\add* that they want to do the evil things that they desire.
\v 4 That is, they will not listen to \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* what is true, but will listen instead to
\add strange\add* stories from our ancestors. 
\v 5  \add Furthermore, I command that\add* you always control what you think and do.
\add Be willing\add* to endure hardships\f + \ft Or: suffering \f*. Your work should be telling people the message
\add about Christ Jesus\add*. As you serve \add the Lord\add*, do everything that
\add God has told\add* you to do. 
\p
\v 6  \add Timothy, I say these things to\add* you because as for me,
\add it is as though\add* \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* \add they are now about to kill me. It is as though my blood
will\add* be poured out {they will kill me} \add as a sacrifice on the
altar\add*; that is, \add I know\add* that it is the time for me to die \\f + \\ft euphemism \\f*.
\v 7  \add And as to telling people the\add* good \add message and defending
it\add*, I have ◄exerted myself thoroughly\f + \ft Or: done \f* it with all my energy► \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f*,
\add like a boxer does. As to doing\add* the work that God gave me to do, I have completed it,
\add like a runner who finishes\add* \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* the race. \add As to\add* what we believe, I ◄have been loyal to it\f + \ft Or: continue \f* to
believe it►. 
\v 8  \add So, like people award\add* a prize \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* \add to the winner of a
race\add*, the Lord, who judges rightly, will give me a reward \add because I have
lived\add* righteously. He will give me that reward when \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* \add he judges
people\add*. And not only \add will he reward\add* me, but he will also reward all those who very much want him to come back.
\s 2 Timothy 4:9-15 
\s Do your best to come to me soon. 
\p
\v 9 ◄Do your best\f + \ft Or: Try \f* hard► to come to me soon. 
\v 10  \add I say that\add* because Demas has left me. He wanted very much
\add the good things that he might enjoy\add* \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* in this world
\add right now\add*, and so he went to Thessalonica \add city\add*. Crescens
\add went to serve the Lord\add* in Galatia \add province\add*, and Titus went to Dalmatia
\add district\add*. 
\v 11 Luke is the only one who is still with me \add of those who were helping me. And when you
come\add*, bring Mark with you, because he is useful to help me in my work.
\v 12 Tychicus \add cannot help me because\add* I sent him to Ephesus
\add city\add*. 
\v 13 And when you come, bring the coat that I left with Carpus in Troas
\add city\add*. Also, bring the books, but ◄most of all\f + \ft Or: especially \f*►
\add I want\add* ◄the parchments\f + \ft Or: the \f* animal skins► \add on which important things are
written\add*. 
\p
\v 14 Alexander, the man who makes things from metal, did many evil\f + \ft Or: harmful \f* things to me. The Lord will punish him for what he
did. 
\v 15 So you, too, must beware of him. \add He will try to destroy your work if he
can\add*, because he very much opposes the message that we \add proclaim\add*.
\s 2 Timothy 4:16-18 
\s The Lord will rescue me from everything that is evil and bring me safely to heaven.
\p
\v 16 When I first defended myself\add in court here\add*, no one came along
\add to help defend\add* me. Instead, they all left me. \add I pray\add* that it will not be counted against
{\add God\add* will forgive} them \\f + \\ft litotes \\f* \add for leaving me\add*.
\v 17 Nevertheless, the Lord was with me and strengthened me. He enabled me to fully preach the message, and all the non-Jewish
people \add in the court\add* \f + \ft (OR, people from many nations) heard it. And I was rescued
\add by the Lord\add* {\add the Lord\add* rescued me} \add from great danger, as if I were
taken\add* \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* out of a lion's (OR, wild animal's) \f* mouth. 
\v 18  \add Therefore, I am sure that\add* the Lord will rescue me from everything that is truly evil and will bring me safely
to heaven, where he rules. Praise him forever! ◄Amen!\f + \ft Or: May \f* it be so!►
\s 2 Timothy 4:19-22 
\s Greet my friends there. Your friends here greet you. May the Lord bless you.
\p
\v 19 Greet \add for me\add* Priscilla and \add her husband\add* Aquila and the family of Onesiphorus.
\v 20 Erastus stayed in Corinth \add city\add*. Trophimus, I left in Miletus
\add city\add* because he was sick. 
\v 21 ◄Do your best\f + \ft Or: Try \f* hard► to come to me before ◄the stormy season\f + \ft Or: winter \f*►. Eubulus, Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and many other
fellow believers \add in this city\add* ◄send their greetings to\f + \ft Or: say \f* that they are thinking affectionately about► you.
\v 22  \add I pray that\add* the Lord will \add help you in\add* your spirit,
\add Timothy, and\add* that\add he\add* will act kindly toward all of you
\add believers who are there\add*.
