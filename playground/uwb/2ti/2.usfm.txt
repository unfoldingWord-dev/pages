\s 2 Timothy 2:1-2 
\s Let God empower you; and entrust the message to loyal\f + \ft Or: trustworthy \f* people.
\p
\v 1 You \add are like a\add* son to me. So I urge also that you
\add let God\add* empower you \add spiritually\add* as a result of Christ Jesus acting kindly toward you.
\v 2  \add As you do that\add*, remembering that \add the message\add* that you heard from me is the same message that other
people have affirmed\f + \ft Or: declared \f* to you, you must entrust\f + \ft Or: give \f* that message to people whom you can trust, people who will be
competent\f + \ft Or: able \f*\f + \ft Or: qualified \f* to teach others. 
\s 2 Timothy 2:3-13 
\s Endure with me what we suffer for Christ Jesus. 
\p
\v 3 Endure as I do what we suffer for Christ Jesus, like a good soldier
\add endures what he suffers\add*. 
\v 4  \add You know that\add* soldiers, in order to please their captain, do not ◄become involved in civilian affairs\f + \ft Or: spend \f*
time doing other kinds of work► \f + \ft metaphor \f*. \add So, like soldiers, do not let other matters ◄distract you as you serve\f + \ft Or: hinder \f* you
from serving\add*► \add Christ Jesus!\add* 
\v 5  \add Similarly, you know that\add* athletes who do not obey the rules of the contest will not be given {not win} the
prize \f + \ft metaphor \f*. \add So, like athletes, do all that Christ Jesus has commanded so that God will reward
you!\add* 
\v 6  \add You also know that\add* a hard-working farmer should be the first to receive some of the harvest \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\add So, like farmers, work hard for Christ Jesus and expect that God will reward
you!\add* 
\v 7 Think about what I have just written, because, \add if you do\add*, the Lord will enable you to understand everything
\add that you need to understand\add*. 
\v 8  \add Endure everything by\add* remembering how Jesus Christ
\add endured it when he suffered\add*. Remember that he was raised {God raised him} from the dead and
\add God affirmed\f + \ft Or: declared \f* him to be king as\add* his ancestor \add King\add* David was. Those are things that I tell to people
when I tell them the message \add about Christ\add*. 
\v 9 I am suffering \add here in prison\add* because \add some people
oppose\add* the good message \add that I tell\add*. They have even put me in chains as if I were a criminal. Nevertheless, the
message from God is not chained {nothing is preventing \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add others from
proclaiming\add* the message from God}. 
\v 10 Therefore I \add willingly\add* endure all \add that I am suffering\add* for the sake of those
\add whom God has\add* chosen. \add I do this\add* in order that Christ Jesus will save them, too, and that they will be
forever with \add him in the\add* glorious \add place where he is\add*.
\v 11  \add Endure everything as you remember\add* that these words
\add that we all say\f + \ft Or: sing \f*\add* \f + \ft Or: \add that we teach people\add*)
\add are trustworthy\add*, 
\q Since we have stopped behaving as we did in the past, 
\q as though we died when he died, 
\q we shall also live with him. 
\q
\v 12 Since we are also patiently enduring what we suffer, 
\q we shall also rule with him. 
\q But if we say that we do not know him, 
\q he also will say that he does not know us. 
\q
\v 13 If we are unfaithful\f + \ft Or: stop doing what he tells us to do \f*, 
\q he will treat us just like he promised to do, 
\q because he can never be untrue to himself\f + \ft Or: always does what he says that he will do \f*.
\s 2 Timothy 2:14-15 
\s Remind teachers about the things that I have told you and charge them not to quarrel; and be sure that you yourself are the
kind of person that God will approve of. 
\p
\v 14  \add Those whom you appointed to teach others\add* God's truth, keep reminding them about these things that
\add I have told you\add*. Tell them strongly that, since God knows what they are doing (OR, that God
\add will judge them for everything that is wrong that they do, and
therefore\add*) they must not quarrel about words\f + \ft Or: about matters that are not important \f*,
\add because, when teachers quarrel, it helps\add* no one, \add and because, when they quarrel, they
spiritually\add* destroy those who hear them (OR, they cause those who hear
\add them to\add* quit ◄being committed \add to Christ\add*\f + \ft Or: believing \f*
\add in Christ\add*►.) 
\p
\v 15 Do your best\f + \ft Or: Try hard \f* to be the kind of person that God will approve of.
\add Be like a\add* good workman as you teach the true message accurately. If a workman works well, he will not need to be
ashamed of (OR, will be pleased about) \add what he does\add*. 
\s 2 Timothy 2:16-19 
\s Have nothing to do with godless and foolish talk. 
\p
\v 16 Stay away from\f + \ft Or: Do not talk with \f* \add those who talk foolishly
and\add* \add godlessly\f + \ft Or: say things that displease God\add* \f*, because
\add those who talk foolishly\add* will become even more ungodly\f + \ft Or: displeasing to God \f*,
\v 17 and \add because\add* their message will \add harm people\add* \f + \ft simile \f*
\add like\add* gangrene\f + \ft Or: cancer \f* does. \add You know\add* Hymenaeus and Philetus. They are
\add two\add* such people \add who talk in this manner\add*. 
\v 18  \add Specifically\add*, they teach a wrong message; \add that
is\add*, they say \add wrongly that God will not raise the dead people
because\add* he has already given us \add spiritual\add* life. \add They claim that our spiritual life is the only new life
that we will receive. By saying that\add*, they cause some people
\v 19 not to continue to believe \add in Christ\add*. However, \add the congregations
of\add* God are strong \f + \ft metaphor \f*. \add They are like\add* a strong foundation on which is written: “The Lord knows the people who
really belong to him,” and “Every person who calls Jesus \f + \ft metonymy \f* ‘Lord’ must stop doing wicked deeds”.
\s 2 Timothy 2:20-22 
\s Avoid the bad things that some young people desire to do. Do good instead.
\p
\v 20 In a wealthy person's house there are not only utensils made of gold and of silver, but also utensils made of wood and of
clay. The gold and silver \add utensils are used\add* at special
\add occasions\f + \ft Or: events \f*\add*, and the others are used at ordinary \add occasions. Similarly, in a congregation there are those
who\add* \add are ready\f + \ft Or: desire\add* \f* \add to do great things for the Lord Jesus, and there are those like the teachers of
false doctrines\f + \ft Or: teachings \f* who are not\add*. 
\v 21 Therefore, those who rid themselves of \add what is evil in their
lives\add* will be able to\add work well for the Lord. They will be
like\add* utensils \f + \ft metaphor \f* used at special \add occasions\add*, set apart for and especially useful to the owner
\add of the big house. They will be like fine utensils\add* that have been prepared {are ready} to do any kind of good work.
\v 22  \add Because of that\add*, you\add (sg)\add* must avoid doing the wrong actions that
\add many\add* young people desire to do. Instead, you must earnestly do right actions, believe
\add the true teaching\add*, love \add God and others, and you must continually be
at\add* peace with those who ask the Lord \add to help them and who
are\add* pure in every way (OR, who serve \add Jesus\add* faithfully \f*.
\s 2 Timothy 2:23-26 
\s Do not discuss foolish questions but gently instruct those who oppose the true message.
\p
\v 23 Do not talk \add with anyone who\add* foolishly \add wants\add* to argue about matters that are not important.
\add Do not talk with them\add*, because you know that \add when people talk about foolish
things\add*, they begin to quarrel. 
\v 24 But those who serve the Lord must not quarrel. Instead, they should be kind to all people, they should be able to teach
\add God's truth well\f + \ft Or: \add*good teachers \f*, and they should be patient
\add with people\add*. 
\v 25  \add That is, they should\add* gently instruct\f + \ft Or: teach \f* people who oppose
\add the true message. They should do that\add* in order that perhaps God will cause others to completely change what they
think, so that they may acknowledge\f + \ft Or: believe \f* the true \add message\add*.
\v 26 In that way they may get free from \add what is like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* a trap
\add set by\add* the devil. The devil has deceived them in order that
\add they might do\add* what he wants \add them to do\add*.
