\c 32  
\s Jeremiah bought some land 
\p
\v 1 After Zedekiah had been ruling Judah for almost ten years, Yahweh gave me another message, during the time that
Nebuchadnezzar had been ruling \add Babylonia\add* for almost eighteen years.
\v 2 His army had surrounded Jerusalem, and I was in a prison area in the courtyard where the guards of the king's palace
stayed. 
\v 3 King Zedekiah had put me there. I continued to prophesy there
\add about what would happen\add*. I continued to say, “Yahweh says that he is about to allow
\add the army of\add* the king of Babylon to capture this city [DOU].
\v 4 And the soldiers of Babylonia will capture King Zedekiah and ◄take him to/put him in the hands of► the king of Babylon.
\v 5 Then his \add soldiers\add* will take Zedekiah to Babylon, and he will remain there until I arrange for him to be
punished. And if he tries to fight against the soldiers from Babylonia, he will not succeed.” King Zedekiah asked me why I
continued to say that. 
\p
\v 6 At that time, Yahweh gave me another message. He said, 
\v 7 “\add Your cousin\add* Hanamel, the son of Shallum \add your
uncle\add*, will come to you. He will say to you, ‘Buy my field at Anathoth,
\add your hometown\add*. \add Because you are my closest relative\add*,
\add it is written in our laws that\add* you have the right to buy it
\add before I ask if anyone else wants to buy it\add*.’ ” 
\p
\v 8 And just as Yahweh had predicted, my cousin Hanamel came to see me in the courtyard of the palace. He said, “Please buy my
field at Anathoth in the area where the descendants of Benjamin live. It is written in our laws that you have the right to buy
it before I ask if anyone else wants to buy it.” When he said that, I knew that the message that I had received was truly from
Yahweh. 
\p
\v 9 So, I bought the field at Anathoth. I paid Hanamel seventeen pieces of silver for it.
\v 10 I signed the paper/papyrus on which it was written that I was buying it, while others were watching/witnessing it. Then I
weighed the silver and gave it to him. 
\v 11 Then I took two copies of the paper/papyrus. One was sealed and the other was not sealed. On both of them was written the
price and conditions of the purchase. I took both copies 
\v 12 and I gave them to Baruch, who was the son of Neraiah and the grandson of Mahseiah. I did this while my cousin Hanamel,
the other witnesses who had signed the paper/papyrus, and other men of Judah who were there in the courtyard, were watching.
\p
\v 13 Then, while they were all listening, I said to Baruch, 
\v 14 “This is what the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels the God whom we Israelis
\add worship\add*, says: ‘Take both copies of this paper/papyrus and put them in a clay jar, to preserve them for a long time.
\v 15 Do that because this is what I, the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels, the God whom you Israelis
\add worship\add*, say: \add Some day people will again own property\add* in this land, and they will buy and sell houses and
vineyards and fields.’ ” 
\s Jeremiah's query about buying the land 
\p
\v 16 After I had given the papers/papyri to Baruch, I prayed to Yahweh, saying this:
\mi
\v 17 “Yahweh, you are my Lord! You made the sky and the earth by your very great power. [MTY, DOU] Nothing is too difficult
for you \add to do\add*. 
\v 18 You show thousands of people that you faithfully love them, but you punish people for the sins that their parents have
committed. You are the great and powerful God, the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels.
\v 19 You make wise plans and you do mighty deeds. You see how all people behave [DOU], and you do to them what they deserve.
\v 20 You performed many miracles [DOU] in Egypt, and you continue to perform miracles here in Israel and everywhere else in
the world. Because of that, you have ◄become very famous/caused many people to know that you are very great/powerful►.
\v 21 You brought our Israeli ancestors out of Egypt by performing many great miracles [DOU], using your very great power
[DOU], causing \add our enemies to be\add* terrified. 
\v 22 You gave to us Israeli people this land that you solemnly promised to give to our ancestors, a land that is very fertile
[IDI]. 
\v 23 Our ancestors came here and conquered this land and started to live in it, but they refused to obey you or to do what you
commanded them to do. Because of that, you have caused them to experience all these disasters.
\pi
\v 24 And now, \add the army\add* of Babylonia has built ramps up against our city walls
\add in order to attack our city\add*. Because of our enemies' swords and because of famines and diseases, they will be able to
conquer it easily. The things that you said would happen have now happened.
\v 25 And it is evident that the Babylonian army will soon conquer this city. So now, Yahweh my Lord,
\add I do not understand\add* why you told me to buy this field with my silver, while others were watching.
\add It seems that I have just been wasting my money by doing that\add*!”
\s Yahweh's reply about buying the land 
\p
\v 26 Then Yahweh gave me this message: 
\v 27 “I am Yahweh, the God \add who rules\add* all the people \add in the
world\add*. There is absolutely nothing [RHQ] that is too difficult for me
\add to do\add*. 
\v 28 So, this is what I say: \add It is true that\add* I will enable the Babylonian army and King Nebuchadnezzar to capture
this city. 
\v 29 The soldiers of Babylonia who are now \add outside the walls\add* around the city will enter and burn this city. They
will burn down all the houses where people caused me to become angry by burning incense on the tops of their roofs to
\add honor\add* Baal and by pouring out offerings of wine to other gods.
\p
\v 30 The people of Israel and Judah have continually done only evil things from the time that they became a nation. They have
caused me to become very angry by all their evil deeds. 
\v 31 From the time that this city was built until now, the people of this city have done only things that caused me to be very
angry [DOU]. So now I will destroy it. 
\v 32 The people of Israel and Judah, including their kings, their officials, the priests, the false prophets, and all the
other people in Jerusalem have committed many sins that have caused me to become angry.
\v 33 My people have turned away from me and have refused to return to me. Even though I taught them things many times, they
would not pay attention to what I taught them, and they would not obey me.
\v 34 They have set up their detestable idols even in my own [MTY] temple and ◄defiled it/caused it become a place that is
unacceptable for people to worship me►. 
\v 35 They have built shrines to \add honor\add* Baal in Ben-Hinnom Valley
\add outside Jerusalem\add*, and there they sacrifice their sons and daughters to their god Molech. I never commanded them to
do such horrible deeds. I never even thought that anyone might do such a terrible thing. And by doing it they have caused all
the people of Judah to \add be guilty of having\add* sinned.” 
\s The promise to restore Judah and Israel 
\p
\v 36 “But now \add I will say something more\add* about this city.
\add You people of Jerusalem have been saying\add*, ‘The army of the king of Babylon will conquer it, either by their swords or
because of famines or diseases.’ But this is what I, the God whom you Israeli people
\add say you belong to\add*, say: 
\v 37 ‘I will certainly bring my people back here again, from all the countries to which I will force them to go because I am
extremely angry [DOU] with them. I will bring them back to this city and allow them to live here safely.
\v 38 They will be my people, and I will be their God. 
\v 39 I will give them one way of thinking [IDI] and behaving, in order that they may revere me, for their good and for the
good of their descendants. 
\v 40 I will make an agreement with them that will last forever: I will never stop doing good things for them, and I will
encourage them to revere me and never turn away from me. 
\v 41 I will be happy to do good things for them, and I will surely enable them to return to this land and remain here [MET]; I
will do that with all my inner being and all my strength.’ 
\p
\v 42 And this is also what I, Yahweh, say: ‘I have caused them to experience all these disasters. Similarly, some day I will
do for them all the good things that I have promised. 
\v 43  \add By buying land you, Jeremiah, have predicted that some
day\add* people will buy and sell fields in this land about which you people of Jerusalem now say, “The Babylonian soldiers
have destroyed it. It is now desolate. It is a land where there are no longer any people or animals.”
\v 44  \add But some day\add* people will again buy and sell fields here. People will sign documents
\add about buying those fields\add*, and other people will witness them doing that. That will happen in the land where
\add the descendants of\add* Benjamin live and here in the villages near Jerusalem, in other towns in Judah, in the hilly areas
and in the foothills \add to the west\add*, and in the southern desert area, too. Some day I will cause them to prosper again.
\add That will surely happen because\add* I, Yahweh, have said it.’ ”
