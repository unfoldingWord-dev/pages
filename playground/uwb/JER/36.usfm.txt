\c 36  
\s They read Jeremiah's scroll 
\p
\v 1 When Jehoiakim had been the king of Judah for almost four years, Yahweh gave this message to me:
\v 2 “Get a scroll, and write on it the messages that I have given to you regarding Israel, Judah, and the other nations. Write
all of the messages, starting from the time that I gave you the first message, when Josiah was the king, up until now.
\v 3 When the people of Judah hear again about all the disasters that I plan to cause them to experience, perhaps each one of
them will repent. If they do that, I will be able to forgive them for the wrong/evil things that they have done.”
\p
\v 4 So I summoned Baruch, the son of Neraiah. Then, as I dictated to him all the messages that Yahweh had spoken to me, he
wrote them on a scroll. 
\v 5 Then I said to him, “I am not allowed to \add leave here and\add* go to the temple.
\v 6 So, you go to the temple on the next day when the people are ◄fasting/abstaining from food►, and read to them the messages
from Yahweh that you wrote while I dictated them to you. Read them
\add aloud\add* to all the people \add who are there, including\add* the people of Judah who come there from their towns.
\v 7 Perhaps they will turn from their evil behavior and request Yahweh
\add to act mercifully toward them\add*. \add They must do that\add*, because Yahweh is very angry with them and has threatened
to punish them severely.” 
\p
\v 8 Baruch did what I told him to do. He \add went to the temple
and\add* read \add to the people\add* all those messages from Yahweh.
\v 9 He did it in December on a day when their leaders had proclaimed that all the people in Jerusalem and the people who had
come there from other towns in Judah should fast to \add please/honor\add* Yahweh. It was when Jehoiakim had been king for
almost five years. 
\v 10 Baruch read to all the people the messages that he had written on the scroll. He read them while he was in the temple, in
the room where Gemariah stayed. He was the son of Shaphan, who had previously been the king's secretary. That room was close to
the upper courtyard of the temple, near the entrance to the temple that is called the New Gate.
\p
\v 11 When Micaiah, who was the son of Gemariah and grandson of Shaphan, heard these messages from Yahweh,
\v 12 he went down to the secretary's room in the palace, where all the king's officials were meeting. Elishama the king's
secretary was there. Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, Elnathan the son of Acbor, Gemariah, Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all
the other officials of the king were also there. 
\v 13 When Micaiah told them about the messages that Baruch had been reading to the people,
\v 14 the officials sent Jehudi, who was the son of Nethaniah and grandson of Shelemiah and great-grandson of Cushi, to tell
Baruch to come and read the messages to them, also. So Baruch took the scroll and went to them.
\v 15 They said to him, “Please sit down and read it \add to us\add*.” So Baruch did what they requested.
\p
\v 16 After they had heard all the messages, they were afraid. They looked at each other and then they said, “We must tell
these messages to the king!” 
\v 17 Then they asked Baruch, “How did you get this scroll? Did Jeremiah dictate to you all the messages on this scroll?”
\p
\v 18 Baruch replied, “Yes, Jeremiah dictated them to me, and I wrote them with ink on this scroll.”
\p
\v 19 Then the officials told Baruch, “You and Jeremiah must both hide. Do not tell anyone where you are!”
\p
\v 20 They put the scroll in the room of Elishama, the king's secretary. Then they went to the king, who was in the courtyard,
and reported to him everything \add that Baruch had read to them\add*.
\s The king burned Jeremiah's scroll 
\p
\v 21 Then the king sent Jehudi to get the scroll. Jehudi brought it from Elishama's room and read it to the king, while all
the king's officials were standing there. 
\v 22 It was in the cold season, and the king was in a part of the palace where he stayed when it was cold. He was sitting in
front of a fire to keep/be warm. 
\v 23 Each time Jehudi finished reading three or four columns, the king cut off that section of the scroll with a knife and
threw it into the fire. He did that, section by section, until the entire scroll was burned up.
\v 24 Neither the king nor his officials showed that they were afraid
\add that God would punish them\add*. They did not tear their clothes
\add to show that they were sorry for what they had done\add*. 
\v 25 Elnathan, Delaiah, and Gemariah pleaded with the king not to burn the scroll, but he did not pay any attention.
\v 26 Then the king commanded his son Jerahmeel, Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel to arrest Baruch
and me. But \add they were unable to do that because\add* Yahweh had hidden us.
\s Jeremiah had another scroll written 
\p
\v 27 After the king had burned the scroll on which were written the messages that I had dictated to Baruch, Yahweh said this
to me: 
\v 28 “Get another scroll, and \add tell Baruch to\add* write everything again, the same messages that he had written on the
scroll that the king burned. 
\v 29 Then go to the king and say to him, ‘Yahweh says this: You burned the scroll because
\add you did not like\add* what was written on it, that the king of Babylon would surely [RHQ] come
\add with his army\add* and destroy this land and get rid of all the people and the animals.
\v 30 Now this is what I, Yahweh, say about you, Jehoiakim: None of your descendants will rule this kingdom [MTY]. Your corpse
will be thrown out \add on the ground and not buried\add*; it will be under the hot sun during the days and struck by frost
during the nights. 
\v 31 I will punish you and your family and your officials for their sins. And I will cause the people of Jerusalem and the
people of the other towns in Judah to experience all the disasters that I promised, because you all would not pay attention to
what I said!’ ” 
\p
\v 32 So I took another scroll, and again I dictated the messages to Baruch. He wrote everything that had been written on the
other scroll, the one that King Jehoiakim had burned in the fire. But this time, I added more messages.
