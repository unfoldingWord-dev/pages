\s A message about Moab 
\p
\v 1 This is a message about Moab. The Almighty Commander of the armies of angels said:
\q “Terrible things will happen to Nebo \add town\add*; 
\q2 it will soon be ruined. 
\q Kiriathaim \add city\add* will be captured and \add all its people will
be\add* humiliated; 
\q2 the high wall around the city will be ruined, and its people will become ashamed.
\q
\v 2 No one will boast about Moab again; 
\q2 the enemies of Moab will plan to destroy \add the capital city\add*, Heshbon.
\q2 They will say, ‘Come, let's cause Moab to no longer be a nation.’
\q You people in Madmen \add town\add*, you also will be silenced;
\q2 enemy armies [MTY] will pursue you. 
\q
\v 3 Listen to the people of Horonaim \add town\add* screaming; 
\q2 they will be wailing because their town will have been devastated and destroyed [DOU].
\q
\v 4 All of Moab will be ruined; 
\q2 even the little children will cry \add loudly\add*. 
\q
\v 5 They will cry bitterly 
\q2 as they climb up Luhith \add hill\add*. 
\q Others will wail on the road down to Horonaim, 
\q2 being very sad because of their town being destroyed. 
\q
\v 6  \add Someone will say to them\add*, ‘Flee! 
\q2 Hide in the desert!’ 
\q
\v 7 But you trusted that because you were rich and powerful, \add you would be
safe\add*; 
\q2 so you will be captured. 
\q Your god Chemosh and all his priests and officials 
\q2 will be taken away to distant lands. 
\q
\v 8 All the towns \add in Moab\add* will be destroyed; 
\q2 none of them will escape. 
\q Towns in the valleys and on the plateau will all be destroyed,
\q2 because I, Yahweh, have said that is what will happen. 
\q
\v 9 Spread salt on the ground 
\q2 in order that it will become a wasteland because \add nothing will grow there
anymore\add*, 
\q2 and no one will be living in it!” 
\b
\q
\v 10 Yahweh will curse anyone who will not eagerly do what he desires,
\q2 anyone who refrains from using his sword to kill [MTY] others
\add in Moab\add*. 
\b
\q
\v 11 The people of Moab have always felt secure; 
\q2 they have never been ◄exiled/forced \add by their enemies\add* to go to other countries►.
\q They are like [MET] wine that has been left undisturbed \add in a container for many days to give it good
flavor\add*, 
\q so now it is smells good, 
\q2 and it tastes good. 
\q
\v 12 But Yahweh says that there will be a time when he will send
\add enemies to attack them\add*; 
\q they will get rid of the people of Moab like people pour out wine
\add on the ground\add* 
\q2 and then smash the wine jar. 
\q
\v 13 Then the people of Moab will be ashamed of their god/idol Chemosh
\add because it did not help them\add*, 
\q2 like the Israeli people were ashamed because their gold statue of a calf
\add was smashed\add* at Bethel. 
\b
\q
\v 14 The soldiers of Moab previously said, “We are warriors; 
\q2 we have fought bravely in battles!” 
\q
\v 15 But now our King, who is Yahweh, who is called 'the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels,' says that the country of
Moab and all the towns in it will be destroyed. 
\q2 Their fine young men will all be slaughtered. 
\q
\v 16 Moab will very soon be destroyed. 
\q2 They will soon experience disaster. 
\q
\v 17 You people who live in nations near Moab, 
\q2 who know that it is very famous, 
\q should mourn for Moab, 
\q and say, “Its glorious power [MTY, DOU] is completely ended/broken.”
\b
\q
\v 18 You people of Dibon \add city\add*, stop being proud because of being honored,
\q2 and sit in the dust/dirt, 
\q because those who will destroy other places in Moab will attack your city
\q2 and destroy your high walls. 
\q
\v 19 You people of Aroer \add town\add*, 
\q2 stand along the road and watch. 
\q Shout to the men and women who will be fleeing from Moab, 
\q2 “What has happened there?” 
\q
\v 20 They will reply, 
\q2 “Moab is ruined and we are disgraced!” 
\q So weep and wail [DOU]. 
\q2 Proclaim at the Aroer \add River\add* that Moab has been destroyed.
\q
\v 21 Yahweh will have punished the towns of Moab that are on the ◄plateau/high level►:
\q2 Holon and Jahaz and Mephaath, 
\q2
\v 22 Dibon and Nebo and Beth-Diblathaim, 
\q2
\v 23 Kiriathaim and Beth-Gamul and Beth-Meon, 
\q2
\v 24 Kerioth and Bozrah, 
\q2 cities that are near each other and towns that are far away from each other.
\q
\v 25 Yahweh says, “The power [MTY] of Moab will be finished; 
\q2 \add it is as though\add* [MET] it will have a broken arm. 
\q
\v 26 You people of Moab have rebelled against me, Yahweh; 
\q2 so now \add I will cause\add* you all to stagger like [SIM] drunken people.
\q You people of Moab will wallow in your own vomit 
\q2 and be ridiculed. 
\q
\v 27 You people of Moab ridiculed the people of Israel [RHQ]. 
\q Although they were thieves, they were never caught [RHQ]. 
\q2 You shook your head at them scornfully and despised them [RHQ].
\q
\v 28 You people who live in Moab, 
\q2 you should abandon your towns and go and live in caves. 
\q Be like [SIM] doves that make their nests in the entrances of caves.”
\b
\q
\v 29 We have all heard that the people of Moab are very proud; 
\q2 they are extremely proud and conceited/arrogant. [IDI, DOU] 
\q
\v 30 But Yahweh says, “I know about that, 
\q2 but it is useless for them to boast 
\q2 because it will accomplish nothing. 
\q
\v 31 So now I will wail for Moab; 
\q2 I will cry about all its people. 
\q2 I will moan for the men of Kir-Hareseth \add city\add*, \add the old capital of
Moab\add*. 
\q
\v 32 You people of Sibmah \add city\add*, you have many vineyards.
\q2 \add It is as though\add* the branches of your vines extend across the Dead Sea to Jazer
\add city\add*. 
\q
\v 33 But no one will be joyful or happy in Moab now; 
\q2 your fruit and grapes that ripen in the ◄summer/hot season► will soon be destroyed.
\q There will be no grape juice coming from the winepresses, 
\q2 so there will be no wine. 
\q People will not shout joyfully 
\q2 as they tread on the grapes; 
\q people will shout, 
\q2 but they will not be shouting joyfully. 
\b
\q
\v 34 Instead, the sound of their wailing will rise from Heshbon
\add city\add* to Elealeh \add town\add* and Jahaz \add village\add*,
\q2 from Zoar \add city\add* as far as Horonaim \add town\add* and Eglath-Shelishiyah
\add village\add*. 
\q Even the water in Nimrim \add Stream\add* will be dried up. 
\q
\v 35 I, Yahweh, say that I will get rid of the people who offer sacrifices on the hilltops,
\q2 and burn incense to their gods. 
\q
\v 36 I [SYN] moan for the people of Moab and Kir-Hareseth 
\q2 like [SIM] \add someone playing a funeral song on\add* a flute,
\q2 because all their wealth will disappear. 
\q
\v 37 The men will shave their heads and their beards to show that they are mourning.
\q2 They all will slash their hands and wear rough cloth around their waists.
\q
\v 38 In every home and in the town plazas/centers in Moab there will be people who are mourning,
\q2 because I will have destroyed Moab 
\q2 like [SIM] someone smashes an old jar that no one wants anymore.
\q
\v 39 Moab will be completely shattered! 
\q2 And you will hear the people wailing loudly! 
\q They will be disgraced. 
\q2 Moab will become a nation that people ridicule. 
\q The people in nearby countries will be horrified \add about what has happened
there\add*. 
\p
\v 40 This is what I, Yahweh, say: 
\q ‘Look! Their enemies will be swooping/rushing down over Moab 
\q2 like an eagle [SIM] swoops down \add to seize an animal\add*.
\q
\v 41 Its cities will be captured, 
\q2 its fortresses will be seized. 
\q Even their warriors will be \add afraid\add*, 
\q2 like [SIM] a woman who is about to give birth. 
\q
\v 42 Moab boasted against me, Yahweh, 
\q2 so it will be destroyed. 
\q
\v 43 I, Yahweh, say that you people of Moab will be terrified, and fall into pits and traps.
\q
\v 44 Those who are terrified and try to run away will fall into deep pits.
\q2 Whoever climbs out of a pit will be caught in a trap, 
\q because I will punish them at the time that I have appointed.’
\b
\q
\v 45 The people will flee as far as Heshbon \add city\add*, 
\q2 but they will not be able to go any further, 
\q because a fire will burn in Heshbon, 
\q2 which is the city where King Sihon lived long ago, 
\q and it will burn up all the people [SYN] in Moab 
\q2 who noisily/loudly boasted very much. 
\q
\v 46 You people of Moab, terrible things will happen to you! 
\q2 You people who worship your god Chemosh, you will be destroyed.
\q Your sons and your daughters will be captured and taken away \add to other
countries\add*. 
\b
\q
\v 47 But some day, I will enable the people of Moab to return to their land again.
\q2 \add That will surely happen because\add* I, Yahweh, have said it.”
\p That is the end of what Jeremiah prophesied about Moab.
