\c 3  
\s The people of Nineveh repented after Jonah warned them 
\p
\v 1 Then Yahweh said to Jonah again, 
\v 2 “Go to that huge city of Nineveh, and tell them the message that I gave you
\add previously\add*.” 
\p
\v 3 So \add this time\add* Jonah obeyed Yahweh, and he went to Nineveh. That city was very big. A person
\add had to walk\add* for three days to completely \add go through/see\add* it.
\v 4 On the first day \add after\add* Jonah \add arrived\add*, he
\add began walking\add* through the city. He was proclaiming \f + \fr (OR, At the end of that day he started proclaiming) \f* to the people,
“Forty days from now, Nineveh will be destroyed [\add God\add* will destroy Nineveh]!”
\p
\v 5 The people of Nineveh believed God's \add message\add*. They all decided that everyone should begin ◄fasting/abstaining
from food►. So \add everyone\add*, including important people and unimportant people,
\add did that\add*. They \add also\add* put on coarse cloth, \add to show that they were sorry for having
sinned\add*. 
\p
\v 6 The king of Nineveh heard what the people were doing. \add So\add* he took off his royal robes, and he also put on coarse
cloth. He left his palace, and sat down where there were \add cold\add* ashes,
\add to show that he also was sorry for having sinned\add*. 
\v 7 Then he sent messengers to proclaim to \add the people in\add* Nineveh: “My advisors and I have decreed that no one may
eat or drink anything. Do not even allow your animals to eat or drink.
\v 8 Instead, every person must put on coarse cloth. \add Put coarse cloth
on\add* your animals, \add too\add*. Then everyone must pray fervently to God. And everyone must stop doing evil
actions/things, and stop acting violently \add toward others\add*.
\v 9 Perhaps, \add if everyone does that\add*, God may change his mind and be merciful
\add to us\add*, and stop being very angry with us, with the result that we will not die.”
\p
\v 10 When they \add all did that\add*, God saw what they were doing, and he saw that they had stopped doing evil actions. So
\add he pitied them, and\add* he did not get rid of them as he had threatened to do.
