\s Jonah refused to go and warn the people of Nineveh 
\s Jonah refused to do what Yahweh told him to do 
\p
\v 1  \add One day\add* Yahweh said to \add the prophet\add* Jonah, the son of Amittai,
\v 2 “I have \add seen\add* how wicked \add the people of\add* [MTY] the great city/Nineveh are. Therefore go there and warn
the people that \add I am planning to\add* destroy their city \add because of their
sins\add*.” 
\v 3 But \add instead of going to Nineveh\add*, Jonah \add went in the
direction\add* opposite to where Yahweh \add told him to go\add*. He went down to Joppa
\add city\add*. There he bought a ticket to travel on a ship that was going to Tarshish
\add city\add*, in order to avoid \add doing what\add* Yahweh \add told him to
do\add*. \add He got on the ship\add*, and \add then went down\add* to a lower deck,
\add lay down\add*, \add and went to sleep\add*. 
\p
\v 4 Then Yahweh caused a very strong wind to blow, and there was such a violent storm that
\add the sailors thought\add* the ship would break apart. 
\v 5 The sailors were very frightened. Because of that, they each started to pray to their own gods
\add to save them\add*. Then they threw the cargo into the sea to make the ship lighter
\add in order that it would not sink easily\add*. 
\p
\v 6 Then the captain went \add down\add* to where Jonah was sleeping soundly.
\add He awoke him\add* and said \add to him\add*, “◄How can you sleep
\add during a storm like this\add*?/You should not be sleeping \add during a storm like
this\add*!► [RHQ] Get up and pray to your god! Perhaps he will pity us and save us, in order that we will not drown!”
\add But Jonah refused to do that\add*. 
\p
\v 7 Then the sailors said to each other, “We need to ◄cast lots/shake from a container small objects that we have all marked►,
to determine who has caused all this trouble!” So they did that, and
\add the lot/object with\add* Jonah's mark fell out \add of the container\add*.
\v 8 So \add various\add* \add ones of\add* them asked him, “Are you the one who has caused us all this trouble?” “What work do
you do?” “Where are you \add coming\add* from?” “What country and what people-group do you belong to?”
\p
\v 9 Jonah replied, “I am a Hebrew. I worship Yahweh God, who \add lives
in\add* heaven. He is the one who made the sea and the land. I am trying to escape from
\add doing what\add* Yahweh \add told me to do\add*.” 
\p
\v 10 After the sailors heard that, they were terrified. So they asked him, “Do you realize what
\add trouble\add* you have caused?” 
\p
\v 11 The \add storm kept getting worse and\add* the waves kept getting bigger. So
\add one of\add* the sailors asked Jonah, “What should we do in order to make the sea become calm?”
\v 12 He replied, “Pick me up and throw me into the sea. \add If you do
that\add*, it will become calm. I know that this terrible storm is the result of my
\add not doing what Yahweh told me to do\add*.” 
\p
\v 13 But the sailors did \add not want to do that\add*. Instead, they tried hard to row the ship back to the land. But they
could not do that, because the storm continued to get worse. 
\v 14 Therefore they prayed to Yahweh, and \add one of them\add* prayed, “O Yahweh, please do not let us drown because of our
causing this man to die. O Yahweh, you have done what you wanted to do.
\add We do not know\add* \add if this man has sinned. If\add* he has not sinned, do not consider that we are guilty of sinning
when we cause him to die!” 
\v 15 Then they picked Jonah up and threw him into the sea. Then the sea became calm.
\v 16  \add When that happened\add*, the sailors became greatly awed at Yahweh's
\add power\add*. So they offered a sacrifice to Yahweh, and they strongly promised
\add him that they would do things that would please him\add*. 
\p
\v 17  \add While they were doing that\add*, Yahweh sent a huge fish that swallowed Jonah. Then Jonah was inside the fish for
three days and three nights.
