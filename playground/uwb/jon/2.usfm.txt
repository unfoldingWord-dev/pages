\c 2  
\s Jonah prayed again after God said that he would save Jonah 
\p
\v 1 While he was inside the huge fish, Jonah prayed to Yahweh God,
\add whom\add* he \add worshiped. After Yahweh told him that he would answer his
prayer\add*, 
\v 2 Jonah said, 
\pi “Yahweh, when I was greatly distressed \add here\add*, I prayed to you, And you heard what I
\add prayed\add*. When I was \add about to descend way down into\add* the place where dead people go, you heard me when I
called out \add for you to help/save me\add*. 
\pi
\v 3 You threw me down into the deep \add water\add*, into the bottom \f + \fr doublet \f* of the sea. The currents of the sea swirled around
me, and the huge waves crashed above me. 
\pi
\v 4 Then I thought, “You have banished me, and I will never be able to enter your presence again. I will never see you holy
temple \add in Jerusalem\add* again!” 
\pi
\v 5 The water surrounded me, and threatened to drown me. Seaweed was wrapped around my head.
\pi
\v 6 I sank down to where the mountains start rising \f + \fr metaphor \f* \add from the bottom of the
sea\add*. I thought that forever \add it would be as though\add* my body would be in a prison \f + \fr metonymy \f*
\add inside the earth\add* below me. 
\pi But you, Yahweh God, whom I \add worship\add*, rescued me from going down to the place of the dead.
\pi
\v 7 When I was almost dead \f + \fr euphemism \f*, Yahweh, I ◄thought about/prayed to► you. You
\add heard\add* my prayer, up \add there where\add* you \add are,
in\add* your holy temple. 
\pi
\v 8 All those who worship worthless idols are rejecting \add you\add*, the one who
\add could\add* act kindly toward them. 
\pi
\v 9 But I will sing to thank \add you\add*, and I will offer a sacrifice to you. I will surely do what I have solemnly
promised \add to do\add*. Yahweh, you are the one who is \add able
to\add* save \add us\add*.” 
\p
\v 10 Then Yahweh commanded the huge fish to vomit out Jonah, \add and the fish did
that\add*, and \add Jonah was able to get\add* to the land.
