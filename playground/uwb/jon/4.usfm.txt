\c 4  
\s God said it was more right for him to spare the Ninevites than to spare the vine he sent to spare Jonah
\p
\v 1 But Jonah was very distressed \add that God had not destroyed
Nineveh\add*. He became very angry. \add The people of Nineveh were non-Jews, and Jonah did not think that God should act
mercifully toward anyone who was not a Jew\add*. 
\v 2 He prayed to Yahweh, “O Yahweh, what you have done is what I thought that you would do, before I left home \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*. That is
why I \add decided\add* immediately to run away, and go to Tarshish
\add land\add*, because I knew that you, O God, act very kindly and compassionately
\add toward all people\add*. You do not quickly become angry with people who do evil. You love people very much, and you change
your mind about punishing \add people who sin\add*. 
\v 3  \add So\add* now, O Yahweh, \add since you will not destroy Nineveh city as you said you
would\add*, allow me to die, because it would be better for me to die than to
\add continue to\add* live.” 
\p
\v 4 Yahweh replied, “◄Why is it right for you to be angry \add about my not destroying the
city\add*?\f + \ft Or: It \f* is not right for you to be angry \add about my not destroying the
city\add*!► \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*” 
\p
\v 5 Jonah \add did not reply\add*. He went out of the city to the east
\add side of it\add*. He made a small shelter in order that he could sit under it and be protected from the sun. He sat under
the shelter and waited to see what would happen to the city. 
\v 6 Then Yahweh God caused a vine to grow up \add immediately\add* to shade Jonah's head from the sun and make him feel more
comfortable. Jonah was very happy about having the vine \add over his
head\add*. 
\v 7 But before dawn the next day, God sent a worm that chewed the vine, with the result that the vine withered.
\v 8 Then, when the sun rose \add high in the sky\add*, God sent a very hot wind from the east, and the sun shone very strongly
on Jonah's head, with the result that he felt faint. He wanted to die, and he said, “It would be better for me to die than to
\add continue to\add* live!” 
\p
\v 9 But God asked Jonah, “Is it right for you to be angry about
\add what happened to\add* the vine?” Jonah replied, “\add Yes\add*, it is right!
\add Now\add* I am very angry and I want to die!” 
\p
\v 10 But Yahweh said \add to him\add*, “You have been concerned about my
\add causing\add* that vine \add to wither\add*, even though you did not take care of it, and you did not make it grow. It just
grew up during one night, and it completely withered \add at the end
of\add* the next night. 
\v 11 But there are more than 120,000 people in Nineveh who \add are very young, and because of
that\add*, they cannot tell which is their right hand and which is their left hand, and there are also many cattle,
\add and none of these have done anything to displease me\add*. So ◄is it not right for me to be concerned about the people of
that huge city, \add and not want to destroy them\add*?\f + \ft Or: it \f* is certainly right for me to be concerned about the people of that
huge city \add and not want to destroy them\add*!► \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*”
