\c 5  
\s Hebrews 5:1-10 
\s As Christ suffered, he learned to be a compassionate high priest by obeying God.
\p
\v 1 Every \add Jewish\add* high priest was chosen by \add God\add*
{\add God\add* chose every \add Jewish\add* high priest} from among\add ordinary\add* men. They were appointed
{\add He\add* appointed them} in order that they would come before him on behalf of the people.
\add Specifically, God appointed them\add* in order that they would bring gifts
\add to him on behalf of the people\add*, and in order to sacrifice
\add animals to him\add* for people who sinned. 
\v 2 The high priests could deal gently with those who ignorantly sinned, since they themselves tended to sin easily.
\v 3 As a result, they had to offer something to God for themselves for their own sins, just like
\add they had to offer something to God\add* for \add God's\add* people who sinned.
\v 4 Furthermore, no one honors himself \add by appointing himself to become a high
priest\add*. Instead, God chose each man \add to become a high priest\add*, as he chose Aaron
\add to be the first high priest\add*. 
\v 5 Similarly, Christ also did not honor himself by appointing himself to become a high priest. Instead, God
\add appointed him by\add* saying to \add him what he never said to any other priest, what
the\add* Psalmist wrote in the Scriptures, 
\q You\add (sg)\add* are my Son! Today I have declared that I am your Father!
\p
\v 6 And he also said \add to Christ what the Psalmist wrote\add* in another Scripture passage,
\q You are a priest eternally just like Melchizedek was a priest.
\p
\v 7 When Christ lived on the earth \f + \ft metonymy \f*, he prayed \f + \ft doublet \f* to God and tearfully cried out loudly to him.
\add Specifically\add*, he asked \add God\add*, who was able to help him, that he would not
\add fear the sufferings just before\add* he died. As a result, God listened to him, because Christ reverently submitted
\add to what God wanted him to do\add*. 
\v 8 Although Christ is \add God's own Son\add*, he learned to obey
\add God\add* by suffering \add before he died\add*. 
\v 9 By becoming all \add that\add* God intended him to be\f + \ft Or: perfect \f*,
\add he has now\add* become fully qualified \add to be our high priest. As a result, he is the one who
saves\add* eternally all who obey him. 
\v 10 Furthermore, God has designated him to be \add our\add* high priest in the way that Melchizedek was a high priest.
\s Hebrews 5:11-14 
\s You are not ready for more advanced spiritual truth. 
\p
\v 11 Although there is much to say \add to you(pl)\add* about \add how Christ resembles
Melchizedek\add*, this is hard \add for me\add* to explain \add to
you\add* because you now understand things so slowly. 
\v 12  \add You became Christians long ago. So\add* by now you should be teaching
\add spiritual truths to others\add*. But you still need someone to teach you again the truths that God has revealed.
\add I am talking about\add* the truths that we teach people \add when
they\add* first \add believe in Christ\add*. You need \add those elementary
truths\add* like babies need milk \f + \ft metaphor \f*. You are not \add ready for advanced teaching, which is
like\add* the solid food \add which mature people need\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\v 13 Remember that those \add who are still learning these elementary
truths\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* have not become familiar with \add what God\add* says concerning becoming\f + \ft Or: being \f* righteous. They are
\add just like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* babies \add who need\add* milk! 
\v 14 But \add the more advanced spiritual truth\add* is for people who are
\add spiritually\add* mature, just like \f + \ft metaphor \f* solid food is for \add people who are
physically\add* mature. They can tell the difference between what is good and what is evil, because they have trained
themselves \add to keep doing that\add*.
