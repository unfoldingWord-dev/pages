\v 1 Long ago God communicated frequently to our ancestors in various ways by what the prophets
\add wrote\add*. 
\v 2 But now when this final age \add is beginning\add*, God has communicated to us
\add just once\add* by means of what his Son\f + \ft Or: the man who was also God \f*
\add said and did. God\add* appointed him in order that he would possess everything
\add that truly belongs to God. God also appointed\add* him in order that he would create the universe.
\v 3 He manifests God's glory. He exactly represents \add what God is
like\add*. He sustains everything\f + \ft Or: carries everything forward to its proper goal \f* by means of his powerful words. When he had
\add enabled people to be\add* freed from the \add guilt of\add* their sins \f + \ft metaphor \f*, he sat down in heaven \f + \ft euphemism \f*
\add to rule\add* at the place of highest honor \f + \ft metonymy \f* with God \f + \ft metonymy \f*.
\s Hebrews 1:4-14 
\s God's son is greater than the angels. 
\p
\v 4 By doing that he \add showed that he\add* was very much greater than the angels, to the extent that his relationship \f + \ft metonymy \f*
\add to God, as his Son\add*, is more excellent than the relationship the angels
\add have to God\add*. 
\v 5  \add We know that\add* because \add in the Scriptures\add* no one \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* ever reported that God said to any angel
\add what he said to his Son\add*, 
\q You\add (sg)\add* are my Son! 
\q Today I have declared to all that I am your Father \f + \ft doublet \f*! 
\q And he said in another Scripture passage, 
\q I will be his Father, 
\q and he will be my Son \f + \ft doublet \f*. 
\p
\v 6 And \add we know his Son is greater than the angels because
in\add* another \add Scripture passage someone wrote this about God's esteemed
Son\add*, when God was about to send him into the world, 
\q All God's angels must worship him. 
\p
\v 7  \add And in the Scriptures it is written that\add* someone said this about the angels:
\q \add God\add* makes the \add angels\add* who serve him \add to be changeable
like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* winds and flames of fire. 
\p
\v 8 But on the other hand, \add in the Scriptures it is written that God
said\add* this to his Son: 
\q You \add (sg)\add* who are \add also\add* God will rule forever \f + \ft metonymy \f*,
\q and you will reign righteously over your kingdom \f + \ft metonymy \f*. 
\q
\v 9 You have loved \add people's\add* righteous \add deeds\add* and you have hated
\add people's\add* lawless \add deeds\add*. 
\q So I, your God, have caused you to be more joyful \f + \ft metonymy \f* than anyone else.
\p
\v 10 And \add we also know that his Son is superior to angels because in the Scriptures the Psalmist wrote
that\add* someone said to God's Son, 
\q Lord, it was you who created the earth in the beginning. 
\q You also made \add the rest of\add* the universe \f + \ft Or: the \add things
in\add* the sky \f* \f + \ft metonymy \f*. 
\q
\v 11 Those things will perish, but you will keep on living \add forever\add*.
\q They will wear out as clothing \add wears out\add*. 
\q
\v 12 You will dispose of them as one rolls up an \add old\add* coat
\add to get rid of it\add*. 
\q \add Then\add*, you will exchange \add all that is in the universe for something
new\add*, 
\q as someone puts on a new garment \add in exchange for an old garment\add* \f + \ft simile \f*.
\q But you \add are not like what you created\add*. 
\q You stay the same, and you live forever \f + \ft litotes \f*! 
\p
\v 13  \add We also know that his Son is superior to angels because no one ever
stated\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add in the Scriptures\add* that God said to any angel
\add what he said to his Son\add*, 
\q Sit next to me and rule with me \f + \ft metonymy \f* 
\q while I put all of your enemies completely under your control \f + \ft metaphor \f*!
\p
\v 14 The angels are \add only\add* spirits who serve\add God\add*.\f + \ft Or: Are not the angels
\add only\add* spirits who serve \add God\add*? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add God\add* sends
them\add to earth\add* in order to help those people who will receive what
\add he will give to\add* those whom he has saved \f + \ft Or: those whom he will save \f*.
