\s Hebrews 3:1-6 
\s Our high priest, Jesus, deserves more honor than Moses does. 
\p
\v 1 My fellow believers, \add God\add* has set you apart and has chosen you, just like he chose me. So consider Jesus.
\add He is God's\add* messenger to us. He is also the high priest whom we say we believe in.
\v 2 He faithfully \add served God\add*, who appointed him, just like Moses faithfully
\add served\add* God's people \f + \ft metonymy \f*. 
\v 3-4 Just like every house is made by someone {as someone makes every house}, Jesus made everything, and he is God\f + \ft Or: Divine \f*. So
God has considered that Jesus is worthy \add that people honor\add* him more than they honor Moses, just like the one who
builds a house deserves that people honor him more than they should honor the house
\add he built\add*. 
\v 5 Moses very faithfully \add served God as he\add* ◄\add helped\f + \ft Or: cared \f*
for\add*► \f + \ft metaphor \f* God's people, just like a servant \add faithfully serves his
master\add*. The result was that Moses testified about what Jesus would say later.
\v 6 But Christ\add faithfully serves God as he\add* ◄\add helps\f + \ft Or: cares \f*
for\add*► his own people \f + \ft metonymy, metaphor \f*, just like a \add son helps\f + \ft Or: cares \f* for his own
family\add*. And we are God's people \f + \ft metonymy \f* if we continue to confidently
\add believe in Christ\add* and if we continue to proudly wait for
\add what God will do for us\add*. 
\s Hebrews 3:7-11 
\s Do not stubbornly rebel against God as their Jewish ancestors did.
\p
\v 7 The Holy Spirit \add caused the Psalmist to write these words in the Scriptures to the
Israelites\add*: 
\q Now, when you\add (pl)\add* hear God speaking to you \f + \ft metonymy \f*, 
\v 8 do not stubbornly \add disobey\f + \ft Or: refuse to\add* obey \add him\add* \f* \f + \ft idiom \f*,
\add as the your ancestors stubbornly disobeyed him\add* when they rebelled against
\add him\add* in the desert. 
\p \add At that time, God said to them\add*, “They tried to determine how many
\add things that displeased me they could do\add* in the desert \add without me punishing
them\add*. 
\v 9 Your ancestors repeatedly tested \add whether I would be patient with them, even
though\add* for forty years they saw all the amazing things I did.
\p
\v 10 So, I became disgusted with the people who saw those things, and I said
\add about them\add*, ‘They are constantly disloyal to me, and they do not understand how I
\add wanted them\add* to conduct their lives.’ 
\p
\v 11 As a result, because I was angry with them, I solemnly declared, ‘They will not enter
\add the land of Canaan\add* where I would let them rest \f + \ft metonymy \f*!’
\s Hebrews 3:12-15 
\s Beware that you do not stop trusting in Christ. 
\p
\v 12 In accordance with that, my fellow believers, beware that none of you wickedly stops trusting
\add in Christ\add*. That would cause you to reject the all-powerful God.
\v 13 Instead, each of you must encourage each other every day, while
\add you still have\add* the opportunity \f + \ft idiom \f*, in order that no one of you may stubbornly
\add reject God\add* by\add letting others\add* deceive you \f + \ft Or: as you deceive yourselves \f*,
\add with the result that\add* you\add (sg)\add* sin \f + \ft personification \f*. 
\v 14  \add We must do that\add*, because we\add (inc)\add* benefit in
\add all\add* Christ \add has done\add* only if we firmly keep trusting
\add in him\add* from the time when we first confidently\add trusted in
him\add* until \add the time when\add* we die \f + \ft euphemism \f*. 
\v 15  \add We can do this\add* by paying attention to \add what the Psalmist wrote in that Scripture passage in
which\add* God said, 
\q Now, when you hear me speaking\add to you(pl)\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*, do not stubbornly disobey me as
\add your ancestors stubbornly disobeyed me\add* when they rebelled
\add against me\add*. 
\s Hebrews 3:16-19 
\s It was their ancestors for whom God did great things who rebelled against God.
\p
\v 16 ◄\add You must keep trusting in God\add* because you must remember who it was who rebelled against God although they
heard him speaking to them.\f + \ft Or: Do \f* you remember who it was who rebelled against God although they
heard\add him speaking to them\add*?► \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* It was people who had certainly experienced \f + \ft litotes \f* God's power. ◄It was all those
people whom Moses led miraculously out of Egypt.\f + \ft Or: Was \f* it not all those people whom Moses led
\add miraculously\add* out of Egypt?► \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* 
\v 17 And ◄\add you must remember\add* who it was that God was disgusted with for forty years.\f + \ft Or: do \f* you
\add remember\add* who it was that God was disgusted with for forty years?► \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* ◄It was those same people who had sinned like
that, and whose bodies as a result lay where they died in the desert!\f + \ft Or: Was \f* it not those
\add same\add* people who had sinned \add like that\add*, and whose bodies as a result lay
\add where they died\add* in the desert area?► \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* 
\v 18 And ◄\add you must remember\add* about whom God solemnly declared, “They will not enter the land where I would let them
rest.”\f + \ft Or: do \f* you \add remember\add* about whom \add God\add* solemnly declared, “They will not enter the land where I
\add would let them\add* rest”?► \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* It was those Israelites who disobeyed God.
\v 19 So, from that example we\add (inc)\add* perceive that it was because they did not keep trusting
\add in God\add* that they were unable to enter \add the land where they would
rest\add*.
