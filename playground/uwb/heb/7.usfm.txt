\s Hebrews 7:1-3 
\s There are ways in which Melchizedek was like God's Son. 
\p
\v 1  \add Now I will say more about\add* this \add man\add* Melchizedek. He was the king of Salem
\add city and was\add* a priest of God, the one who is greater \add than anyone
else\add*. He met Abraham who was returning \add home\add* after
\add he and his men\add* had defeated the \add armies of four\add* kings \f + \fk synecdoche \f*. Melchizedek
\add asked God to\add* bless Abraham. 
\v 2 Then Abraham gave to him one tenth of all \add the spoils he\add* took after
winning\add the battle. Melchizedek's name\add* means firstly ‘king
\add who rules\add* righteously,’ and since Salem means ‘peace’, he was the ‘king
\add who rules\add* peacefully.’ 
\v 3  \add In the Scriptures there is\add* no \add record of who
his\add* father \add was\add*, nor \add is there any record of who
his\add* mother \add was\add*, nor \add is there any record of who
his\add* ancestors \add were\add*. There is no \add record of when he
was\add* born, nor \add is there any record of when he\add* died.
\add For these reasons\add*, \add it is as though\add* he continues to be a priest forever, and for this reason he is like
God's Son. 
\s Hebrews 7:4-10 
\s Melchizedek was greater than Abraham. 
\p
\v 4 You can realize how great this \add man Melchizedek was\add* from the fact that Abraham,
\add our famous\add* ancestor, gave him ◄a tithe/one tenth► of the spoils
\add from the battle\add*. 
\v 5 According to the laws \add God gave Moses\add*, the descendants of
\add Abraham's great-grandson\add* Levi, who were priests, should take tithes from
\add God's\add* people who were their relatives, even though those people also were Abraham's descendants.
\v 6 But this man \add Melchizedek\add*, who was not among the descendants
\add of Levi\add*, took tithes from Abraham. He also \add asked God
to\add* bless Abraham, the man to whom \add God\add* promised \add many
descendants\add*. 
\v 7 We know for certain that it is the more \add important people\add* who
\add ask God to\add* bless the less important people. \add And Melchizedek blessed Abraham. So we conclude that Melchizedek was
greater than Abraham\add*. 
\v 8 In the case of \add the priests who are descendants of Levi\add*, men who some day will die receive tithes. But in the
case of \add Melchizedek it is as if God\add* testifies that he was still living,
\add since there is no record in Scriptures about his death\add*.
\v 9 And it was as though Levi himself, and \add all the priests descended from
him\add*—who received tithes \add from the people\add*—paid tithes
\add to Melchizedek\add*. And when Abraham paid tithes, it \add was as though Levi and all the priests descended from him
acknowledged that the work Melchizedek did as a priest was greater than the work Levi
did\add*, 
\v 10 since \add the sperm from which all those priests were eventually
born\add* was still in Abraham's body \f + \fk euphemism \f* when Melchizedek met Abraham.
\s Hebrews 7:11-19 
\s The former Jewish priests were not adequate, so a new one like Melchizedek had to come.
\p
\v 11  \add God\add* gave his laws to his people at the same time he gave regulations about the priests. So, if what the
priests who were descended from Levi did could have provided a way for God to completely
\add forgive\add* people \add for disobeying those laws\add*, ◄certainly no other priest like Melchizedek would have been
necessary./why would another priest like Melchizedek have been necessary?► \f + \fk rhetorical question \f* Instead, priests who were descended from
Aaron, \add Levi's descendant, would have been adequate\add*. 
\v 12  \add But we know they were not adequate, because a new type of priest like Melchizedek has
come\add*. And since \add God\add* has appointed a new type of priest, he also had to change the regulations
\add concerning how priests were appointed\add* {\add he appointed
priests\add*}. 
\v 13  \add Jesus\add*, the one about whom I am saying these things, is a descendant of someone else,
\add not a descendant of Levi\add*. None of the men from whom Jesus descended ever served as priests \f + \fk metonymy \f*.
\v 14  \add We know that\add* since it is obvious that it is from
\add the tribe of\add* Judah that our Lord was descended. Moses never said that any of Judah's descendants would
\add become\add* priests. 
\v 15 Furthermore, \add we know that the priests who were descended from Levi were inadequate,
since\add* it is even more obvious that another priest has appeared who is like Melchizedek.
\v 16 Jesus became a priest, but not because \add he fulfilled\add* what
\add God's\add* law required \add about being a descendant of Levi\add*. Instead, he has the kind of power that
\add came from a\add* life that nothing can destroy \f + \ft (OR, \add enabled him
to\add* live \add again after he was\add* killed). 
\v 17  \add We know this\add* since \add God\add* confirmed it in
\add the Scripture passage in which he said to his Son\add*, 
\q You\add (sg) \f*\add* are a priest eternally just like Melchizedek was a priest.
\p
\v 18 On the one hand, God canceled what he commanded previously
\add concerning the priests\add* because it failed in every way to enable anyone
\add to become all that God intended\add*. 
\v 19 Remember that no one was able to become all that God intended
\add by obeying\add* the laws \add that God gave Moses\add*. On the other hand,
\add God caused that we could\add* confidently expect better things
\add than we could expect by obeying God's laws\add*. \add He did that by his establishing Christ as
priest\add*. Now by means of \add Christ sacrificing himself for
us\add* we can come near to God. 
\s Hebrews 7:20-25 
\s Jesus lives eternally as a high priest to plead with God for us.
\p
\v 20 Furthermore, \add when God appointed Christ, it was when God\add* solemnly declared
\add that Christ would be a priest\add* \f + \fk litotes \f*. When \add God appointed
former\add* priests, it was not by his solemnly declaring \add that they would be
priests\add*. 
\v 21 However, when he \add appointed Christ to be a priest\add*, it was by these words that
\add the Psalmist wrote in Scripture\add*: 
\q The Lord has solemnly declared \add to the Messiah\add*, 
\q —and he will not change his mind— 
\q “You will be a priest forever!” 
\p
\v 22 Because of that, Jesus guarantees that \add the new\add* covenant will be better
\add than the old one\add*. 
\p
\v 23 And formerly, the priests could not keep serving \add as priests\add*, because they all died \f + \fk personification \f*. So there were many
priests \add to take the place of the ones who died\add*. 
\v 24 But because \add Jesus\add* lives eternally, he will continue to be a high priest forever.
\v 25 So, he can completely and eternally save those who come to God by
\add trusting in what\add* Christ \add has done for them\add*, since he lives forever to plead
\add with God\add* to help them. 
\s Hebrews 7:26-28 
\s Jesus is the kind of high priest we need, because he was sinless.
\p
\v 26 Jesus is the kind of high priest that we need. He was holy, he did no wrong, and he was innocent.
\add God\add* has \add now\add* separated him from \add living among\add* sinners, and
\add has now taken him\add* up to the highest heaven. 
\v 27  \add The Jewish\add* high priests need to sacrifice \add animals\add* day by day
\add as well as year by year\add*. They do this, firstly, \add to
atone\add* for their own sins, and then \add to atone for other\add* people
\add who have sinned\add*. \add But because Jesus never sinned\add*, he does not need to do that. The only thing
\add he needed to do to save people\add* was to sacrifice himself once!
\v 28  \add We need a high priest like\add* him, because \add Moses\add* wrote in the laws
\add that God gave him\add* \f + \fk personification \f* that the ones who would be appointed to be priests would be men who tended
\add to sin easily\add*. But \add God\add* solemnly \add declared\add* \f + \fk personification \f* after
\add he had given\add* his laws \add to Moses\add* that \add he would
appoint\add* ◄his Son/the man who is also God► \add to be a high priest.
Now\add* ◄\add his Son/the man who is also God\add*► has forever become all that God intends him to be.
