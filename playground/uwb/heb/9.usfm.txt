\s Hebrews 9:1-5 
\s A description of the man-made sanctuary that accompanied the first covenant.
\p
\v 1  \add To continue\add*: In the first \add covenant God\add* regulated how people
\add should perform\add* rituals, and \add he told them to make\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* a sanctuary.
\v 2  \add That sanctuary\add* was a tent that \add the Israelites\add* set up. In its outer room there was the lampstand and
the table \add on which they put\add* the bread that \add the priests\add* presented
\add to God. That room\add* was called 'the holy place.' 
\v 3 Behind the curtain inside \add the holy place\add* there was
\add another\add* room. That was called 'the very holy place.' 
\v 4 It had an altar, \add made from\add* gold, \add for burning\add* incense.
\add It also had the chest which they called\add* the chest of the covenant. All its sides were covered with gold. In it was
the golden pot which contained \add pieces of the food they called\add* manna.
\add That was the food with which God miraculously fed the people before they entered the promised
land\add*. In the chest there was also Aaron's walking stick that budded
\add to prove that he was God's true priest\add*. In the chest were also the stone tablets
\add on which God had written\add* the Ten Commandments. 
\v 5 On top of \add the chest\add* were \add figures of\add* winged creatures
\add that symbolized God's\add* glory. Their \add wings\add* overshadowed the chest's lid where
\add the high priest sprinkled the blood\add* to \add atone for\f + \ft Or: to
forgive\add* \f* \add those who had sinned. I\add* do not \add need\add* to write about these things in detail now.
\s Hebrews 9:6-10 
\s Offerings that were made under the first covenant were not able to remove a sense of guilt for sin.
\p
\v 6 After all those things were prepared {After they had prepared all those things like that}
\add in the two rooms of the tent\add*, the \add Jewish\add* priests habitually went into the outer
\add room of the\add* tent to perform their rituals. 
\v 7 But into the inner room, only the high priest \add went\add*, once a year. He always took \f + \ft litotes \f* the blood
\add of animals that they had slaughtered\add*. He offered them \add to
God\add* for his own \add sins\add* and for the sins that other people had committed. They included sins that they did not
realize \add were sinful\add*. 
\v 8 By those things the Holy Spirit indicated that \add just like
God\add* did not reveal the way \add for ordinary people\add* to enter into the inner room while the outer room still existed
\f + \ft metaphor \f*, \add similarly he did not reveal the way for ordinary people to enter the presence of God while the Jewish system of
offering sacrifices was in effect\add*. 
\v 9  \add The things that the priests did inside the outer room\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* symbolized
\add what was true\add* during the time \add when the first covenant was in
effect\add*. According to \add the first covenant\add* (OR\add , In that outer
room\add*), \add priests\add* offered gifts and other sacrifices to God. But
\add by offering them\add*, the people who brought them were unable to make themselves feel that they were no longer guilty for
having sinned. 
\v 10  \add They brought those gifts and made those sacrifices\add* according to
\add regulations concerning\add* things to eat and drink, and \add according to rules that required people
to\add* wash various things. \add God\add* declared that those regulations about our bodies were to be in effect until
\add he put into effect the new covenant\add*; that was a better system.
\s Hebrews 9:11-14 
\s Christ redeemed us by offering his own blood as a sacrifice. 
\p
\v 11 But when Christ came as our high priest, \add he brought\add* the good things that are now available. When he appeared,
\add he went into God's presence in heaven. That is like a\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* very great and perfect tent not made by humans {which no
human made} \f + \ft synecdoche \f*; that is, it is not part of the world \add God\add* created. It was better
\add than the tent Moses set up here on earth\add*. 
\v 12  \add When a high priest goes into the inner room in the tent each year, he
takes\add* goats' blood and calves' blood \add to offer as a sacrifice\add*. But Christ did not
\add do that. It was as though\add* he went into that very holy place only once, taking his own blood with him. By doing that,
he eternally redeemed us. 
\v 13 The priests sprinkle on people goats' blood and bulls' blood and
\add the water that has been filtered through\add* the ashes of a
\add red\add* heifer that has been\add completely burned. By performing that ritual, they can
ritually\add* cleanse the bodies of those who are \add ceremonially\add* unclean. Furthermore, performing those rituals enabled
people to have fellowship with God again. 
\v 14  \add So, because we know what\add* Christ \add accomplished
when\add* his blood flowed \add when he died for us\add* \f + \ft personification, metonymy \f*, we will be very certain that we are not guilty
\add for having\add* done those things \add that those who are spiritually\add* dead do.
\add As a result\add*, we can serve the all-powerful God. \add The priests always offer to God
animals\add* with no defects. Similarly, when Christ offered himself
\add as a sacrifice\add* to God, he was sinless \f + \ft metaphor \f*. He did that as a result of
\add God's\add* eternal Spirit \add helping him\add*. 
\s Hebrews 9:15-22 
\s Christ has put the new covenant into effect with his own blood.
\p
\v 15  \add By\add* dying \add for us\add*, \add Christ\add* \add redeemed\f + \ft Or: \add*set free from the penalty for their sins \f* even
those who disobeyed the \add conditions of\add* (OR: \add during the time
of\add*) the first covenant. So, \add because\add* no \add one could be made perfect by obeying the old
covenant\add*, now Christ establishes \add between God and people\add* a new covenant. He does that in order that those whom
God has chosen may eternally have \add the blessings that God\add* has promised them.
\v 16 A covenant \add is like a will. In the case of a will\add*,
\add in order to put its provisions into effect\add*, someone must prove that the one who made it has died.
\v 17 A will goes into effect \add only when the one who makes the
will\add* has died. It is not in effect when the one who made it is still alive.
\v 18 And so \add God\add* put the first covenant into effect only \f + \ft litotes \f* by means of
\add animals'\add* blood that was shed \add when they were slaughtered\add*.
\v 19 After Moses had declared to all the Israelites everything that God commanded in the laws
\add that God gave him\add*, he took calves' and goats' blood \add mixed\add* with water. He
\add dipped into it\add* scarlet wool \add that he tied around\add* a sprig of hyssop. Then he sprinkled
\add with some of the blood\add* the scroll itself containing God's laws. Then he sprinkled
\add more of that blood on all the\add* people, 
\v 20 saying to them, "This is the blood \add which brings into effect\add* the covenant that God commanded that you
\add obey\add*." 
\v 21 Likewise, he sprinkled with that blood the tent and every object that they used in performing rituals.
\v 22 It was by \add sprinkling\add* blood that they \add ritually\add* cleansed almost everything. That was what
\add was stated in\add* God's laws. If blood is not shed \add when people offer a sacrifice,
God\add* cannot forgive \add the person who is making the sacrifice\add*.
\s Hebrews 9:23-28 
\s The Jewish priests kept offering the blood of animal sacrifices every year, but Christ sacrificed himself once to take away
our guilt. 
\p
\v 23 So, by rituals like that, it was necessary for \add the priests\add* to cleanse the things that symbolized what Christ
does \f + \ft metonymy \f* in heaven. But God has to \add consecrate\add* the \add people who will
enter\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* heaven \add by means of\add* better sacrifices than those.
\v 24 Christ did not enter a sanctuary that humans made. That one only represented the true
\add sanctuary\add*. Instead, he entered heaven itself, in order to now be in God's presence
\add to plead with\add* God for\f + \ft Or: to \add represent\add* \f* us. 
\v 25 The \add Jewish\add* high priest enters the very holy place once every year, taking blood that is not his own,
\add to offer it as a sacrifice\add*. But when Christ entered heaven, it was not in order to offer himself repeatedly like
that. 
\v 26  \add If that were so\add*, he would have needed to suffer
\add and shed his blood\add* repeatedly since \add the time when
God\add* created the world. But instead, in this final age, \add Christ\add* has appeared once in order that by sacrificing
himself he could cause \add that people\add* no longer will be \add punished for
their\add* sins. 
\v 27 All people must die once, and after that \add God\add* will judge them
\add for their sins\add*. 
\v 28 Likewise, when Christ \add died\add*, \add God\add* offered him once to be a sacrifice, to punish him instead of the many
\add people who had\add* sinned. He will come \add to earth\add* a second time, not
\add in order to sacrifice himself again for those who\add* have sinned, but in order to
\add complete\add* his saving those who expectantly wait for him.
