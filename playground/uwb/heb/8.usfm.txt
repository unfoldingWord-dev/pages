\c 8  
\s Hebrews 8:1-6 
\s The rituals that were performed by the Jewish high priests were only a model of what Jesus our high priest does in heaven.
\p
\v 1 The main point of \add all\add* that \add I\add* have written is that we have a high priest like that. He has sat down to
rule \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* with God \\f + \\ft euphemism \\f* at the place of greatest honor in heaven.
\v 2 He ministers in the Most Holy Place, that is, in the true place
\add of worship in heaven\add*. That is a place that \add Moses'\add* tent
\add represented\add*. The Lord set up the true place of worship. No human
\add set it up\add*. 
\p
\v 3 Every high priest was appointed {\add God\add* appointed every high priest} to offer
\add to God\add* gifts and sacrifices \add for people who sinned\add*. So, since
\add Christ became a high priest\add*, he also had to offer something.
\v 4 Since there are already \add Jewish\add* priests who offer gifts as God's laws
\add require\add*, if Christ were \add now living\add* on the earth, he would not be a high priest.
\v 5 The \add Jewish\add* priests perform rituals which are only a model \\f + \\ft doublet \\f* of
\add what Christ would do in heaven\add* \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f*. What \add God\add* told Moses when Moses was about to set up the tent
\add for worshipping him supports the idea that those rituals were only a model. God
said\add*, “Be sure that you \add (sg)\add* make everything according to the model that I showed you on Sinai Mountain!”
\v 6 But now as it is, \add Christ\add* ministers in a more excellent way
\add than the Jewish priests do\add*. Likewise, the \add new\add* covenant that he established
\add between God and people\add* is better \add than the old one. When the new covenant was
established\add* {\add God established the new covenant\add*}, he promised us better things
\add than the laws that God gave Moses did\add*. 
\s Hebrews 8:7-13 
\s The first covenant was not adequate, so God needed a new one.
\p
\v 7 If that first covenant had been perfectly adequate \\f + \\ft litotes \\f*, God would not have thought that he needed another
\add covenant to replace it\add*. But \add it was not adequate, so he needed a new
one\add*. 
\v 8 Because God declared \add that the Israelites\add* were guilty
\add of not obeying the first covenant, he wanted a new covenant. This is
what\add* ◄\add a prophet\f + \ft Or: Jeremiah \f*\add*► \add wrote about that\add*:
\q The Lord says, “Listen! There will soon be a time 
\q when I will make a new covenant with the people \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* of Israel and the people \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* of Judah.
\q
\v 9 That covenant will not be like the covenant that I made with their ancestors
\q when I led them out of Egypt \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* \add like a father leads a
child\add* by the hand. 
\q They did not continue to \add obey\add* my covenant, 
\q so I rejected them,” says the Lord. 
\q
\v 10 “This is the covenant that I will make with the Israelites \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f*,
\q after \add the first covenant has ended\add*” \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f*,” says the Lord:
\q “I will enable them to understand my laws \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f*, 
\q and I will enable them to obey them \f + \ft (OR, truly know them) \f* \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* sincerely.
\q I will be their God, and they will be my people \\f + \\ft doublet \\f*. 
\q
\v 11  \add As a result\add*, no one will \add need to\add* teach a fellow citizen
\q or tell his fellow kinsmen, ‘\add You need to\add* know the Lord,’
\q because all \add my people\add* will know me: 
\q \add my people\add* of every status \add will know me\add*. 
\q
\v 12 I will mercifully \add forgive them for\add* the wicked things they have done.
\q I will no longer \add consider\add* that \add they are guilty
for\add* \\f + \\ft doublet \\f* \add their\add* sins.” 
\p
\v 13 Since God spoke about a new \add covenant\add*, he considered that the first
\add covenant\add* was no longer in use, and that it would soon disappear, just
like\add anything that\add* gets old \add will disappear\add* [MET, DOU].
