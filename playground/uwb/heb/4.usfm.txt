\s Hebrews 4:1-5 
\s The Israelites failed to enter the place where they would rest; we must beware of acting like them.
\p
\v 1  \add The Israelites did not enter the place where they would
rest\add*. But \add God\add* has still promised us that we can enter the place of resting
\add in heaven eternally\add*. So we must beware \add of the possibility\add* that
\add God\add* may consider that some of you have failed to enter the
\add place of\add* resting \add eternally as the Israelites did not enter the place where they would
rest\add*. 
\v 2 We have heard the message\add about Christ\add*, just like \add the
Israelites\add* heard \add what God promised\add*. But \add just
like\add* the message did not benefit \add most of\add* those who heard it because they did not believe it as
\add Joshua and Caleb did, it\add* will not\add benefit us eternally if we do not keep believing
it\add*. 
\v 3 We who have believed\add in Christ\add* are able to enter the place of resting
\add eternally. We know there is a place where we will rest eternally\add* because God said,
\q Because I was angry with them, I solemnly declared, "They will not enter
\add the land where\add* I would let them rest." 
\p \add God said that\add* even though he ceased his work\add of creating
things\add* after he created the world. 
\v 4 What someone wrote somewhere \add in the Scriptures\add* about the seventh
day\add after he had spent six days creating the world\add*, supports that,
\q Then, on the seventh day, God rested from his work \add of creating
everything\add*. 
\p
\v 5 But note again what God said about the Israelites\add in the\add* passage that I quoted previously,
\q They will not enter\add the land where\add* I would let them rest.
\s Hebrews 4:6-10 
\s The Scriptures support the claim that there is a time when God's people will rest eternally.
\p
\v 6 Some people experience entering that \add place of resting eternally.
But\add* those\add Israelites\add* who first had the good message preached to them {first heard the good message}
\add about what God promised them\add* did not enter \add that place of
resting\add*, because they refused to believe \add God\add*. 
\v 7  \add But God\add* appointed another time\add that we may enter that place of
resting\add*. That time is now! \add We know that is true because\add* much later than when
\add the Israelites rebelled against God in the desert\add*, he caused
\add King\add* David to write what I have already quoted, 
\q Now, when you understand what God is saying \add to you\add*, do not stubbornly disobey him.
\p
\v 8 If Joshua had led the Israelites to enter the place of resting, God would not have spoken later about another
\add time when we could rest\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. \add So we know God was speaking about another time when some people would enter that
place of resting eternally\add*. 
\v 9 So, just like \add God rested on\add* the seventh day \add after he finished making
everything\add*, there remains a time when God's people will rest eternally.
\v 10 Specifically, whoever enters God's place of resting has ceased doing
things\add to gain God's favor\add*, just like God ceased doing his work
\add of creating everything\add*. 
\s Hebrews 4:11-13 
\s We must beware of being insincere about trying to enter the place of eternal rest.
\p
\v 11 God severely punished the \add Israelites because they disbelieved his
message\add*. So we must strive to experience entering that\add place
of\add* resting \add eternally\add*, in order that he will not severely punish any of us for not believing
\add his message\add*. 
\v 12  \add Beware of being insincere about doing this\add*, because the message God
\add has given us\add* very powerfully penetrates our thinking more than a two-edged sword
\add penetrates flesh\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. It penetrates \add deeply\add* into our souls and spirits, as
\add a sharp sword can penetrate\add* into our joints and marrow. That
\add is, by it God\add* \f + \ft personification \f* discerns all that we think about, and he discerns all that we desire
\add to do\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* \f + \ft Or: \add His message\add* exposes\add to us\add* all our thoughts and all our desires \f*.
\v 13 God knows everything about everyone. Everything is completely exposed \f + \ft doublet \f* to him,
\add and he is\add* the one \f + \ft synecdoche \f* who will say whether he approves of what we have done.
\s Hebrews 4:14-16 
\s Let us come boldly to Christ, our high priest, to receive his gracious help.
\p
\v 14 We have a great high priest who ascended through the heavens
\add when he returned to God's presence\add*. He is Jesus, God's Son\f + \ft Or: the man who is also God \f*. So let us firmly
profess\add what we believe about him\add*. 
\v 15 Our high priest can indeed \f + \ft litotes \f* compassionately deal with us who tend to sin easily, because he also was
tempted\add to sin\add* in every way that we are \add tempted to
sin\add*, and yet he did not sin. 
\v 16 So, let us come boldly to\add Christ\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*, who rules \f + \ft metaphor \f*
\add from heaven\add* and does for us what we do not deserve, in order that we might
experience\add his acting\add* mercifully \add toward us\add*, and in order that we might experience his kindly helping us
whenever we need \add it\add*.
