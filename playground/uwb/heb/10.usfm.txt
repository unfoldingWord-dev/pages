\c 10  
\s Hebrews 10:1-4 
\s The blood of animals can never take away the guilt for sins. 
\p
\v 1 Just like a shadow vaguely represents the thing that it is a shadow of, the laws that God
\add gave Moses\add* only poorly represent \f + \ft metaphor \f* the good things that were to come later. Those laws were not all the good
things themselves that God has promised. So, by offering the same kinds of sacrifices every year, people \f + \ft personification \f* who approach God
can never become perfect\f + \ft Or: all that God intends them to be \f*. 
\v 2 If God had removed the guilt for having sinned of those who brought the sacrifices, they would not feel that they were
still guilty. So they would certainly have stopped offering those sacrifices!\f + \ft Or: would they not have stopped offering those
sacrifices? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* 
\v 3 But rather, the fact that they offer those sacrifices each year reminds them that they are still guilty for their sins.
\v 4 The principle is that blood of animals such as bulls or goats can never remove the guilt of those who have sinned.
\s Hebrews 10:5-10 
\s Christ set us apart for God by offering his own body once as a sacrifice.
\p
\v 5 So, as \add Christ\add* was coming into the world, he said \add to his Father about offering himself as a sacrifice for
people's sin, in words that the Psalmist wrote\add*, 
\q It is not sacrifices and offerings that you\add \f + \ft singular \f*\add* have wanted,
\q but you have prepared for me a body \add to serve you\add*. 
\q
\v 6 Animals that are completely burned up as sacrifices have not pleased you,
\q and \add other sacrifices that atone\add* for those who have sinned have not pleased you.
\q
\v 7 Then \add because of this\add*, I said, "My God, listen!\f + \ft Or: here I am! \f*
\q I have come \add here\add* in order to do what you want me \add to
do\add*, 
\q \add just like\add* has been written {as they have written} about me in the Scriptures."
\p
\v 8 First he said, "It is not sacrifices and offerings and animals that
\add the priests\add* have completely burned up and other \add offerings to atone
for\add* those who have sinned that you have really wanted. They have not pleased you."
\add He said that even though\add* those things were offered {they offered all those things} according to the laws
\add God gave Moses!\add* 
\v 9 Then, \add concerning his offering himself as a sacrifice to atone for people's
sin\add*, he said, "Listen! I have come \add here\add* to do what you want me
\add to do!\add*" Thus Christ got rid of the first \add way of atoning for
sin\add*, in order to establish the second \add way of atoning for\add* sin.
\v 10 Because of Jesus Christ \add doing what God\add* wanted him to do, we have been set apart
{\add he\add* has set us apart} for God by his offering his own body only once
\add as a sacrifice, a sacrifice that will not need to be repeated\add*.
\s Hebrews 10:11-18 
\s Scripture supports the claim that Christ made one sacrifice that will be adequate forever.
\p
\v 11 As every \add Jewish\add* priest stands daily\add in front of the
altar\add*, he performs rituals and offers the same kind of sacrifices that could never remove
\add the guilt from anyone who\add* sinned \f + \ft metonymy \f*. 
\v 12 But \add Christ\add* offered a sacrifice that \add will be
adequate\add* forever, and he offered it only one time! Then he sat down
\add to rule\add* with God at the place of highest honor \f + \ft metonymy \f*. 
\v 13 From now on, he is waiting for \add God\add* to completely subdue
\add all\add* his enemies \f + \ft metonymy \f*. 
\v 14 By offering himself once, he has provided that those whom \add God\add* has set apart will be eternally made perfect\f + \ft Or: all
that God intends them to be \f*. 
\v 15 The Holy Spirit also confirms to us \add that that is true\add*. First the Lord says:
\q
\v 16 When the time \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add of the first covenant\add* with my people has finished,
\q I will make a new covenant with them \f + \ft metonymy \f*. 
\q I will do like this for them: 
\q I will cause them to understand my laws 
\q and I will cause them to obey them \f + \ft Or: enable them to know them sincerely \f*.
\p
\v 17 Then \add he said\add*: 
\q \add I will forgive them for\add* their \f + \ft doublet \f* sins, 
\q and I will \add consider\add* that they are no longer \add guilty
for\add* having sinned. 
\p
\v 18 When \add God\add* has forgiven someone's sins, that person does not
\add need to make\add* any more offerings \add to atone for his sin!\add*
\s Hebrews 10:19-25 
\s Let us come to God and let him make us pure and help us to hold fast to his truth and do things that please him.
\p
\v 19 So, my fellow believers, because we \add trust in what Jesus accomplished
when\add* his own blood \add flowed for us\add*, we can confidently go into
\add God's very presence\add* that was \add symbolized\add* by the very holy place
\add in the tent\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f*. 
\v 20 He enabled us to go into \add God's presence\add* by making a new and effective way.
\add Specifically\add*, he \add offered\add* his body \add as a sacrifice\add* for us
\add in order that nothing would stop us\add* from entering \add God's presence, just
like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* the curtain \add of the very holy place prevented people from entering God's
presence\add*. 
\v 21 Christ is a great priest \add who rules over us, who are\add* God's people \f + \ft metonymy \f*.
\v 22  \add Just like the priests\add* were sprinkled {\add as Moses\add* sprinkled
\add the priests\add*} \add with blood\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* to symbolize that they were no longer guilty for having sinned, we also no
longer are \add guilty for having done\add* evil. \add Just like the priests
ceremonially\add* washed their bodies with pure water \add to prepare themselves to serve
God\add*, we are allowing \add God\add* to continually make us pure. So,
we\add \f + \ft inclusive \f*\add* must approach \add God\add* sincerely by confidently trusting
\add in him\add*. 
\v 23 We must unwaveringly keep professing \add what we believe. Since
God\add* faithfully \add does all\add* he promised \add to do\add*, we must confidently expect
\add him to keep doing that\add*. 
\v 24  \add Since God\add* faithfully \add does all that\add* he promised
\add to do\add*, let us consider how each of us can stimulate the others, in order that
\add each one\add* will love the others, and in order that each one will do good deeds.
\v 25 We must not cease assembling ourselves \add to worship the
Lord\add*, as some people have done. Instead, each one of us must encourage\f + \ft Or: exhort \f* the others.
\add Let us do that\add* all the more since we know that the day
\add that the Lord will return\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* is near. 
\s Hebrews 10:26-31 
\s If we have known and then rejected the message about Christ, God will surely punish us.
\p
\v 26  \add We\f + \ft inclusive \f* must do those things\add*, because if we deliberately and habitually sin after we have known the true
\add message about Christ\add*, no other sacrifice will remove our guilt for having sinned in this way.
\v 27 Instead, we must fearfully expect that \add God will\add* judge us, and then he will angrily
\add punish\add* his enemies in a furious fire \f + \ft metaphor \f*. 
\v 28 Everyone who rejected the laws \add that God gave\add* Moses was mercilessly killed when
\add at least\add* two or three people testified that they had done that.
\v 29  \add That was severe punishment\add*. But \add Christ\add* is God's Son\f + \ft Or: the man who is also God \f*. His blood, by means
of which \add he put into effect\add* the new covenant, is sacred. Because of
\add Christ's\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* blood \add flowing for us when he died\add*,
\add God\add* freed us from our guilt. So, you can be sure \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* that anyone who shows contempt for
\add those truths\add* and who insults the Spirit of God, the one who acts with kindness toward us in a way we do not deserve,
deserves to be punished even worse than that \f + \ft metaphor \f*! 
\v 30  \add We can be sure of that\add* (OR\add , need to think about that
carefully\add*) since we know that God said, "I myself will get revenge on those who sinned, and I will give them the
punishment that they deserve \f + \ft doublet \f*." And \add Moses wrote\add*, "The Lord will judge his people."
\v 31 It will be a terrible thing if the all-powerful God \f + \ft metonymy \f* seizes and punishes you \f + \ft idiom \f*!
\s Hebrews 10:32-39 
\s Remember how you accepted persecution because of your faith in Christ, and do not be discouraged if you are persecuted now.
\p
\v 32 Recall the former times when you \add first\add* understood \f + \ft metaphor \f*
\add the message about Christ\add*. You endured a hard struggle, and you
\add continued to trust him\add* when you suffered \add because you believed in
Christ\add*. 
\v 33 At times you were publicly insulted {people publicly insulted you} and you were caused to suffer {people persecuted you}.
At other times you showed great concern for those who were treated like that.
\v 34 You not only were kind to those who were in prison \add because they believed in
Christ\add*, but you also accepted it joyfully when \add unbelievers\add* took away your possessions. You accepted it because
you yourselves knew very well that you have eternal possessions \add in
heaven\add* that are much better \add than those that they took from
you!\add* 
\v 35 So, do not become discouraged \add when they cause you to suffer\add*
{\add you are persecuted\add*}, because \add if you continue to trust in
God\add*, he will greatly reward you. 
\v 36 You must patiently continue \add to trust in him\add* in order that, because of your doing what God wants you to do, he
will give you what he has promised. 
\v 37  \add You must do that\add* since \add a prophet wrote\add* in the Scriptures
\add that God said about the Messiah\add*, 
\q In just a short time the one \add I promised\add* would come will surely come;
\q he will not delay coming. 
\q
\v 38 But those whom I have summoned, who \add act\add* righteously, must continually live trusting in me,
\q because if they, in a cowardly manner, cease \add to trust in
me\add*, I 
\q will not be pleased\f + \ft Or: will be angry \f* with them. 
\p
\v 39 But we are not ones who in a cowardly manner cease \add to trust in
God\add*, with the result that God will severely punish us. Instead, we are ones who trust in him, with the result that
\add God\add* will save us \f + \ft synecdoche \f* eternally.
