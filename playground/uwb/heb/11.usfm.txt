\c 11  
\s Hebrews 11:1-3 
\s Because of our faith, we confidently expect to receive God's promises.
\p
\v 1 It is because people trust \add God\add* that they are sure that they will receive the things that they confidently expect
\add God to give them\add*. They are also certain \add that they will see those things
happen\add*, though no one sees them yet. 
\v 2 It was because our ancestors trusted in God that \add he\add* commended them.
\v 3 It is because we trust in God that we understand that God formed the universe by commanding
\add that it exist\add*. The result is that the things that we see were not made from things that already existed.
\s Hebrews 11:4 
\s Because of his faith, Abel made a better sacrifice than his brother Cain did.
\p
\v 4 It was because \add Adam's son\add* Abel trusted God that he sacrificed something better to God than what
\add his older brother\add* Cain offered to God. Because Abel did that, when God spoke well about what Abel sacrificed, God
declared that Abel was righteous. And although Abel is dead, we still learn from him
\add about trusting God\add*. 
\s Hebrews 11:5-12 
\s Because of their faith, God blessed Enoch, Noah, and Abraham.
\p
\v 5 It was because Enoch believed \add God that God\add* took him
\add up to heaven\add*. The result was that he did not die. No one found him, because he was taken up
{\add God\add* had removed him} from the earth \add to heaven\add*. Before
\add God\add* took him away, \add he\add* testified that Enoch pleased him well.
\v 6 It is possible for people to please God only if they trust God, because anyone who wants to come to God must first believe
that God exists and that he rewards those who seek \add to know\add* him.
\p
\v 7 It was because Noah trusted \add God\add* that after he was warned by God {after
\add God\add* warned him} about \add a flood that\add* had not yet happened, Noah
\add showed that he\add* revered God by building a huge ship to save his family. By doing that, he
\add showed all the people who did not believe him\add* \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add that they deserved to be
condemned\add* {\add that God would\add* condemn them}. He became one whom God declared to be righteous because of his trusting
in God. 
\p
\v 8 It was because Abraham trusted God that when he was called {when
\add God\add* called him}, he obeyed \add God\add*, he left \add his own
country\add*, and went to a place that God would give him. Abraham left his own country, even though he did not know where he
would be going. 
\v 9 It was because Abraham trusted God that he lived as though he was a foreigner in a land that
\add God\add* had promised to him. Abraham lived in tents, and his son Isaac and his grandson Jacob did also. God promised to
give to Isaac and Jacob the same things that he promised to give Abraham.
\v 10 Abraham was waiting to live in a city \add in heaven\add* that would remain forever \f + \ft metaphor \f*. It was a city that God is
building \f + \ft doublet \f*. 
\v 11 It was because Abraham trusted God that God gave Abraham strength so that he
\add was\add* able to produce a son. Even though his wife Sarah was beyond the time
\add when women bear children\add*, \add God\add* promised \add that he would give her a
son\add*, and Abraham considered that God would do what he promised to do.
\v 12 So, although Abraham was too old to have children, from that one man people descended who are as many in number as the
stars in the sky and are as countless as the grains of sand along the shore,
\add just like God promised him\add*. 
\s Hebrews 11:13-16 
\s All those people who had faith in God died without receiving what God promised.
\p
\v 13 It was while they still trusted in God that all those people died. Even though they had not yet received the things that
God had promised to give them, \add it was as though\add* they saw those things in a distance. They were glad
\add to know\add* about what he promised. It was as though they admitted that they were not from this earth, but that they were
only here temporarily. 
\v 14 As for those people who say\f + \ft Or: believe \f* such things, they clearly show that they long for
\add a place that will become\add* their true native land. 
\v 15 If they had been thinking about \add that place being\add* the place from which they had come, they would have taken the
opportunity to return there. 
\v 16 But, instead, they desired a better \add place in which to
live\add*; that is, they desired \add a home\add* in heaven. So God has prepared a city for them to live
\add with him\add*, and he is pleased \f + \ft litotes \f* for them to say that he is their God.
\s Hebrews 11:17-31 
\s It was because Abraham, Isaac, Joseph, Moses, the Israelite people, and Rahab trusted God that he blessed them.
\p
\v 17 It was because Abraham trusted \add God\add* that he \add was ready
to\add* kill his son Isaac as a sacrifice when \add God\add* tested him. This same man to whom
\add God\add* promised \add to give him\add* \add a son\f + \ft Or: many descendants\add* \f* was going to sacrifice
\add that same son\add*, the only son \add whom his own wife had
borne!\add* 
\v 18 It was to him that God said, "It is \add only\add* from Isaac that I will consider your family to descend."
\v 19 Abraham considered that \add to fulfill that promise\add*, God could make
\add Isaac\add* live again \add even if\add* he had died \add after Abraham sacrificed
him!\add* The result was that when Abraham did receive Isaac back
\add after God told him not to harm Isaac\add*, it was as though he received him back even after he died.
\p
\v 20 It was because Isaac trusted God that he \add prayed that after he died, God
would\add* bless \add his\add* sons Jacob and Esau. 
\p
\v 21 It was because Jacob trusted God that, as he was dying, he
\add prayed that God would\add* bless each of the sons of \add his own son
Joseph\add*. He worshipped God as he leaned upon his walking stick
\add before he died\add*. 
\v 22 It was because Joseph trusted God that, when he was about to die
\add in Egypt\add*, he anticipated the time when the Israelites would leave Egypt; and he instructed
\add that\add* his people \add should carry\add* his bones \add with them when
they\add* \add left Egypt\f + \ft Or: returned to Canaan\add* \f*. 
\p
\v 23 It was because Moses' father and mother trusted God that they hid
\add their son\add* for three months shortly after he was born, because they saw that the child was beautiful. They were not
afraid of \add disobeying\add* what the king of Egypt had commanded,
\add namely, that all the Jewish male babies must be killed\add*.
\v 24 The daughter of the \add king, whom they called\add* Pharaoh,
\add raised\add* Moses, but when he had grown up it was because he trusted God that he refused to
\add accept the privileges that would have been his if people\add* considered that he was the son of the king's daughter\f + \ft Or: the
king's own grandson \f*. 
\v 25 He decided that it was better for others to mistreat him for a time along with the Israelite people, than to temporarily
enjoy living sinfully \add in the King's palace\add*. 
\v 26 This is because he decided that if he suffered for the Messiah, it would be worth far more
\add in God's sight\add* than his owning all the treasures of Egypt
\add that he would receive as Pharaoh's heir. He decided that\add* because he looked forward to the time when
\add God would give him\add* an \add eternal\add* reward. 
\v 27 It was because he trusted God that he left Egypt. He was not afraid that the king would be angry
\add because of his doing that\add*. He kept going\f + \ft Or: did not turn back \f* because
\add it was as though\add* he kept seeing \add God\add*, whom no one can see.
\v 28 It was because Moses believed \add that God would save his own
people\add* that he instituted the \add festival called\add* Passover. He did that
\add by commanding that the people should kill lambs and\add* sprinkle their blood
\add on their\add* doorposts. They did that in order that \add the angel
who\add* causes people to die would not kill \f + \ft euphemism \f* the oldest male Israelites
\add when he killed the oldest sons in each Egyptian family\add*.
\p
\v 29 It was because they trusted God that when the \add Israelite\add* people walked through where the Red Sea had been, it
was as though they walked on dry land! But, when the \add army of\add* Egypt also attempted to
\add cross that same water\add*, they drowned, because \add the sea came back and flooded
them!\add* 
\p
\v 30 It was because the \add Israelite\add* people trusted God that the walls around Jericho
\add city\add* collapsed, after the Israelites marched around the walls for seven days.
\p
\v 31 Rahab \add had been\add* a prostitute, but because she trusted God, she did not perish with those
\add inside Jericho\add* who disobeyed \add God. Joshua sent some
spies\add* into the city \add in order\add* to find ways to destroy it, but God saved her because she welcomed those spies
\add peaceably\add*. 
\s Hebrews 11:32-38 
\s Some who trusted God gained great victories and others were tortured and killed.
\p
\v 32 I do not know what more I should say \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* \add about others who trusted in
God\add*. It would take too much time to tell about Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel, and the
\add other\add* prophets. 
\v 33 It was because they trusted God that some of them \add did great deeds for
him\add*. Some conquered lands ruled by powerful men. Some ruled
\add Israel\add* and justly \add punished those men and nations who rebelled against
God\add*. Some obtained \add from God\add* the things that he promised to give them \f + \ft metonymy \f*.
\v 34 Some forced lions to keep their mouths shut. Some escaped from being destroyed by fire. Some of those people escaped from
\add being killed with\add* a sword \f + \ft metonymy \f*. Some of those \add people who trusted
God\add* were made strong {became mighty} again after they had once been weak. Some became powerful when they fought wars. Some
caused armies \add that came from foreign lands\add* to run away from them.
\v 35 Some women \add who trusted God\add* received \add their relatives\add* back again when
\add God\add* \add made them live again after they had died\f + \ft Or: raised them from the
dead\add* \f*. But \add others who trusted God\add* were tortured until they died. They were tortured because they refused to
agree when \add their captors said, 'We will\add* release you \add if you deny that you believe in God.' They refused to do
that\add*, because they wanted to live with God forever, which is better than
\add continuing to live on earth\add* after having almost died. 
\v 36 Other \add people who trusted God\add* were mocked; \add some had their
backs\add* cut \add open by being struck\add* with whips. Some were chained and put in prison.
\v 37  \add Some of\add* those believers were stoned to death {People
\add killed some of those believers by\add* throwing stones at them}. Others were cut completely in two. Others were killed
with swords. Others of these people who trusted God wandered around the land
\add wearing garments made only of\add* skins from sheep and goats. They did not have any money. They were continually
oppressed and tormented {People continuously oppressed them and tormented them}.
\v 38  \add The people on earth who caused those who trusted in God to suffer were so bad
that\add* they did not deserve \add to live with people\add* like those
\add who trusted God. Some who trusted God\add* wandered in deserts and mountains. Some lived in caves and in other
\add large\add* holes in the ground. 
\s Hebrews 11:39-40 
\s Only when we are together with all these people who trusted God will we receive all God has promised.
\p
\v 39 Although all these people were commended \add by God\add* {\add God\add* commended all these people} because they all
trusted him, God did not give them all that he promised them\add while they were
alive\add*. 
\v 40 God knew ahead of time that what he would give us and them
\add later\add* would be better than giving \add them immediately what he
promised\add*. What God intends is that only when they and we are together will we have all that God intends us to have.
