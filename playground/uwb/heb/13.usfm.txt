\s Hebrews 13:1-3 
\s Love one another, be hospitable, and help imprisoned and other mistreated believers.
\p
\v 1 Continue to love your fellow believers. 
\v 2 Do not forget to be hospitable to needy travelers \f + \fr litotes \f*. You need to know that by being hospitable, some people have
entertained angels without knowing it. 
\v 3 Remember \add to help\add* those who are in prison \add because they are
Christians\add*, as though you were in prison with them. Remember those who are being mistreated {whom people are mistreating}
\add because they are believers. As you do that\add*, consider that you are also alive \f + \fr metonymy \f*,
\add and you could suffer as they do\add*. 
\s Hebrews 13:4-6 
\s Respect the marriage relationship, and avoid covetousness. 
\p
\v 4 You must ◄respect/keep sacred► the marriage relationship in every way, and you must keep sexual relations \f + \fr euphemism \f* pure,
because God will surely condemn those who act immorally and those who act adulterously.
\v 5 Live without constantly coveting money, and be content with the things you possess, remembering what
\add Moses\add* wrote \add that God\add* has said \add about supplying what you
need\add*, 
\q I will never leave you, 
\q I will never stop providing for you \f + \fr doublet \f*. 
\p
\v 6 So we can say confidently \add as the Psalmist said\add*, 
\q Since the Lord is the one who helps me, I will not be afraid! ◄People can do nothing to me
\add that will deprive me of God's blessings\add*./What can people do to me
\add that will deprive me of God's blessings\add*?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* 
\s Hebrews 13:7-9 
\s Remember the manner of life of your former spiritual leaders and imitate their faith; since Christ never changes, do not be
diverted to strange teachings. 
\p
\v 7 Your spiritual leaders used to tell you the message of God \add before they
died\add*. Remember how they conducted their lives. By considering ◄how they died/what resulted from how they lived►, imitate
how they believed \add in Christ/God\add*. 
\v 8 Jesus Christ \add is\add* the same now as he was previously, and he will be the same forever.
\v 9  \add So\add*, do not let yourselves be diverted {let anything divert you} so that you believe various teachings
\add that are contrary to God's truth\add*. It is good that God acts kindly toward us so that we may be strengthened
spiritually. \add Obeying rules about\add* various foods, rules that have not benefited those who obeyed them, will not benefit
us. 
\s Hebrews 13:10-14 
\s We must stop practicing Jewish sacrifices and rituals, and go to Jesus to be saved, since we do not have a city like
Jerusalem where we must offer sacrifices, but instead we wait for a future everlasting heavenly city.
\p
\v 10 We have \add Jesus\add* \f + \fr metonymy \f*. All those who continue to observe the Jewish rituals \f + \fr metonymy \f* of sacrifice have no right to
obtain the benefits of his sacrifice \f + \fr metaphor \f*. 
\v 11 After the high priest brings into the most holy place the blood of animals
\add that they have sacrificed to atone\add* for sins, the bodies of those animals are burned {they burn the bodies of those
animals} outside the camp. 
\v 12 Similarly, Jesus suffered \add and died\add* outside the gate
\add of Jerusalem\add* in order that he might make \add us\add*, his people, holy by
\add offering\add* his own blood \add as a sacrifice to atone for our
sins\add*. 
\p
\v 13 So, we must abandon \add performing Jewish\add* sacrifices and rituals \f + \fr metaphor \f*
\add in order to be saved\add*, and let us go to Jesus \add to be
saved\add*. As we do that, we must \add be willing to\add* let others reproach us just like people reproached him.
\v 14 Here on earth, we believers do not have a city \add such as Jerusalem where we
must\add* continually \add offer sacrifices\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f*. Instead, we are waiting for a future
\add heavenly\add* city \add that will last forever\add*. 
\s Hebrews 13:15 
\s Since Christ sacrificed himself for us, let our continual praise of God be our sacrifice.
\p
\v 15 With \add the help of\add* Jesus, we must continually praise God. That will be something we can sacrifice
\add to him\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f* \add instead of our sacrificing animals only at specific
times\add*. Specifically, we must say openly \f + \fr metonymy \f* \add that we have
trusted\add* in Christ \f + \fr metonymy \f*. 
\s Hebrews 13:16 
\s Continually do good deeds and share with others, because this too will be a sacrifice pleasing to God.
\p
\v 16 Be continually \f + \fr litotes \f* doing good deeds \add for others\add*, and be continually sharing
\add with others the things you have\add*, because doing things like that will
\add also\add* be \add as though you are offering\add* sacrifices that will please God.
\s Hebrews 13:17 
\s Obey and submit to your spiritual leaders. 
\p
\v 17 Obey your \add spiritual\add* leaders and do what they tell you, since they are the ones who are guarding your spiritual
welfare \f + \fr synecdoche \f*. \add Some day\add* they will have to stand before God so that he can say if he approves of what they have done.
Obey them in order that they can do the work of guarding you joyfully and not have to do it sadly, because if you cause them to
do it sadly, that will certainly not help you at all (OR, they will not be able to help you at all).
\s Hebrews 13:18-19 
\s Pray for me that God will quickly remove the things that hinder my coming to you.
\p
\v 18 Pray for me. I am certain that I have not done anything that displeases God. I have tried to act honorably
\add toward you\add* in every way. 
\v 19 I urge you earnestly to pray that \add God\add* will quickly remove the things that hinder my coming to you.
\s Hebrews 13:20-21 
\s May God equip you with everything good that you need, and may Christ be praised forever.
\p
\v 20 Jesus \add provides for us\add*, \add protects us, and guides us
as\add* a great shepherd does for his sheep \f + \fr metaphor \f*. And God, who gives us
\add inner\add* peace, raised our Lord Jesus from the dead. By doing that, God ratified his eternal covenant with us by the
blood \add that flowed from Christ when he died on the\add* cross.
\v 21 So I pray that God will equip you with everything good \add that you need in
order\add* that you may do the things that he desires. May he accomplish in us the things that he considers pleasing as a
result of Jesus Christ \add doing this for us\add*. May Jesus Christ be praised forever. ◄Amen!/May it be so!►
\s Hebrews 13:22 
\s Patiently consider what I have written in this short exhortation.
\p
\v 22 My fellow believers, since this is a short letter that I have written to you, I appeal to you that you patiently consider
\add what\add* I have \add just written you\add* to exhort you. 
\s Hebrews 13:23 
\s Since Timothy has been released from prison, he will accompany me when I go to see you.
\p
\v 23 I want you to know that our fellow believer Timothy has been released
{\add the authorities\add* have released our fellow believer Timothy}
\add from prison\add*. If he comes here soon, he will accompany me when I go to see you.
\s Hebrews 13:24 
\s Greet your spiritual leaders and all other believers; the believers who are from Italy send you their greetings.
\p
\v 24 Tell all your \add spiritual\add* leaders and all the \add other\add* fellow believers
\add in your city\add* that ◄I am thinking fondly about them/I am sending them my greetings►. The believers
\add in this area who have come\add* from Italy \add want you to know
they\add* are ◄thinking about you/sending you their greetings►. 
\s Hebrews 13:25 
\s May God act graciously to you all. 
\p
\v 25  \add I pray that\add* you will continue to experience God's acting kindly toward you all.
