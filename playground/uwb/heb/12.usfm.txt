\c 12  
\s Hebrews 12:1-2 
\s Since we know so many people with faith like that, we must put aside anything, especially sin, which hinders us, and we must
strive to achieve God's will and concentrate on Jesus. 
\p
\v 1 We \add know about\add* many people like that\add who showed they trusted in
God\add*. They are like a crowd of spectators \add who are cheering for us inside a
stadium\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f*. Knowing that, we must put away all the things that hinder us,
\add as a runner puts aside everything that would hinder him because they are
heavy\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f*. Especially we must put away sinful actions that
\add hinder us, as a runner\add* sets aside clothes he does not need, clothes that would entangle him \f + \fr metaphor \f*. Let us
\add wholeheartedly strive to achieve what God has planned for us, as
someone\add* in a race wholeheartedly runs the course that is before him \f + \fr metaphor \f*.
\v 2 And let us \add keep our minds on\add* Jesus, \add as a runner\add* keeps his eyes on
\add the goal\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f*. He is the one we should imitate concerning how he perfectly trusted
\add God. When he died on\add* the cross he endured it when he suffered greatly \f + \fr metonymy \f*, instead of
\add thinking about the things he would\add* rejoice about \add later\add*. He disregarded being disgraced by
\add dying that way\add*. He is now sitting at the place of highest honor \f + \fr metonymy \f* at the throne
\add where God rules\add*. 
\s Hebrews 12:3-6 
\s Do not become discouraged when you are suffering as you struggle against evil.
\p
\v 3  \add Jesus\add* patiently endured it when sinful people acted so hostilely against him. Compare yourselves with him so
that you do not give up \add trusting\add* God or become discouraged.
\v 4 While you have struggled against \add being tempted to\add* sin, you have not yet bled
\add and died because of resisting evil, as Jesus did\add*. 
\v 5 Do not forget \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* these words \add that Solomon spoke to his son, that are the same as
God\add* would exhort you as his children: 
\q My child, pay attention \f + \fr litotes \f* when the Lord is disciplining you,
\q and do not be discouraged when the Lord punishes you \f + \fr doublet \f*, 
\q
\v 6 because it is everyone whom he loves whom the Lord disciplines,
\q and he punishes everyone whom he accepts as his child. 
\s Hebrews 12:7-11 
\s Since our sufferings are to discipline us, if we have not experienced God's discipline we are not his true children. We
should accept God's discipline, because it is always to help us.
\p
\v 7 It is in order that God may discipline you that he requires you to endure the disagreeable things
\add that happen to you\add*. \add When God disciplines you\add* he is treating you as a father treats his children. All
fathers \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* discipline their children \f + \fr litotes \f*. 
\v 8 So, if you have not experienced God disciplining you just like he disciplines all his other children, you are
\add not true children of God\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f*. \add You are like\add* illegitimate children;
\add no father disciplines them\add*. 
\v 9 Furthermore, our natural fathers disciplined us \add when we were
young\add*, and we respected them for doing that. So ◄we should certainly more readily accept God our spiritual Father
disciplining us, with the result that we live eternally!/shouldn't we more readily accept
\add God\add*, our spiritual Father, \add disciplining us\add*, with the result that we live
\add eternally\add*?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f* 
\v 10 Our natural fathers disciplined us for a short time just like they considered right, but God always disciplines us to
help us. He does it so that we may be holy as he is. 
\v 11 During the time that God is disciplining us, that does not seem to be something about which we should rejoice. Instead,
it is something that pains us. But later it causes those who have learned from it to be peaceful and to
\add live\add* righteously. 
\s Hebrews 12:12-17 
\s Renew yourselves spiritually; go forward in your Christian life; try to live peacefully with everyone; seek to be holy;
guard against bitterness; do not be immoral; and do not refuse to listen to God.
\p
\v 12 So, \add instead of acting as though you were spiritually exhausted\add*, renew yourselves \f + \fr metaphor \f* spiritually.
\v 13 Go straight forward \add in your Christian life\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f*, in order that believers who are uncertain about their faith
\add will imitate you\add* and not ◄\add leave God's way/\add*become useless
\add to God\add*► \f + \fr metaphor \f*. Instead, they will be spiritually restored \f + \fr metaphor \f* as an injured and useless limb is restored.
\v 14 Try to live peacefully with all people. Seek to be holy, since no one will see the Lord if he is not holy.
\v 15 Beware that none of you stops \add trusting in\add* God, \add who has done kind things for us that we did not
deserve\add* (OR, Beware that you have never \add experienced\add* God kindly
\add saving you\add*). Be on guard lest any of you \add act evilly towards
others\add*, because that will \add grow like\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f* a root \add grows into a big
plant\add*, and the result \add of your\add* doing that will be that many believers will sin and become unacceptable to God.
\v 16 Do not let anyone be immoral, or be irreligious as Esau was. He exchanged the rights he had as a firstborn son for only
one meal. 
\v 17 You know that after he did that, he wanted to receive \add what his father would promise to give him
if\add* he blessed him. But \add his father\add* refused \add to do what he
requested\add*. And Esau found no way to change what he had done, even though he sought tearfully to do that.
\s Hebrews 12:18-24 
\s You have not experienced the terrifying things your ancestors did; you have come to Christ and benefited from his blood
flowing for you. 
\p
\v 18 In coming \add to God\add* you have not \add experienced things like what the Israeli people
experienced\add* at Sinai Mountain. \add They\add* approached \add a mountain that God told them
they\add* should not touch. \add They approached\add* a blazing fire, and it was gloomy and dark \f + \fr doublet \f*, and there was a
hurricane/cyclone. 
\v 19 They heard a trumpet sounding and they heard \add God\add* speak. The result was that those who heard it pleaded for him
not to speak to them like that again. 
\v 20 When \add God\add* commanded them saying, “If \add a person
or\add* even an animal touches this mountain, \add you\add* must
\add kill him/it by\add* throwing stones at him/it,” they were terrified.
\v 21 Truly, because Moses was terrified after seeing what happened
\add on the mountain\add*, he said, “I am trembling because I am very afraid!”
\v 22 Instead, \add it is as though\add* you have come to \add the presence of God in
heaven\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f*. \add That is like what your ancestors did when they came to
worship\add* God on Zion Hill, in Jerusalem, in the city of the all-powerful God. You have come (OR, you are coming) to where
there are countless angels, who are rejoicing as they have gathered together.
\v 23 You have joined all the believers \add who have privileges
like\add* firstborn sons, whose names \add God\add* has written down in heaven. You have come to God, who will judge everyone.
You have come to where the spirits of God's people are, people who lived righteously
\add before they died\add*, and who now have been made perfect \add in
heaven\add*. 
\v 24 You have come to Jesus, who arranged a new covenant \add between us and
God\add*. You have accepted \add what he accomplished when\add* his blood flowed
\add when he died on the cross. His doing that made it possible for God to forgive
us\add*. That is better than the blood of Abel, \add who just\add* wanted revenge because his brother Cain murdered him.
\s Hebrews 12:25-29 
\s We should be in awe before God, who will punish us if we reject him.
\p
\v 25 Beware that you do not refuse to listen to \add God\add* who is speaking to you. The Israelite people did not escape
\add God punishing them\add* when \add Moses\add* (OR, \add God\add*) warned them here on earth. So ◄we shall surely not escape
\add God punishing us\add* if we reject him when he warns us from heaven!/how shall we escape
\add God punishing us\add* if we reject him when he warns us from heaven?► \f + \fr rhetorical question \f*
\v 26 The earth shook \f + \fr personification \f* then when he spoke \f + \fr metonymy \f* \add at Sinai
Mountain\add*. But now he has promised, “I will shake the earth again, one more time, but I will shake heaven too.”
\v 27 The words “again, one more time” indicate that things \add on
earth\add* will be shaken {that \add he\add* will shake things \add on
earth\add*}, meaning that he will set aside all that \add he\add* has created, in order that the things
\add in heaven\add* that cannot be shaken {that nothing can shake} may remain forever.
\v 28 So, let us thank God that we are becoming members of a kingdom that nothing can shake. Let us worship/serve God in a way
that pleases him by being greatly in awe \f + \fr doublet \f* before him. 
\v 29 Remember that the God we \add worship/serve\add* is like a fire that burns up everything
\add that is impure\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f*!
