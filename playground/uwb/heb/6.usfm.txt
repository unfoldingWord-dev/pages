\s Hebrews 6:1-8 
\s If you believers later reject the message about Christ, God will reject you.
\p
\v 1 So, we\add (inc)\add* must not keep \add discussing\add* the elementary principles about Christ. Instead, we must proceed
\add to the teaching that will make us spiritually\add* mature \f + \fr metonymy \f*. We must not
\add be people who always need someone to teach them\add* the elementary
truths\add about Christ that are like\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f* a foundation. \add I am referring to the teaching that people who do
sinful\add* things, things that \add those who are spiritually\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f* dead do, must turn away from their sinful behavior.
\add I am referring to the teaching\add* that people must believe in God.
\v 2  \add I am referring to the teaching about what\add* various
\add Jewish and Christian\add* rituals for purifying people \add signify. I am referring to the teaching about how elders
enable people to receive spiritual gifts by\add* laying hands \add on
them\add* \f + \fr metonymy \f*. \add I am referring to the teaching that God will\add*
◄\add cause\add* those who have died to live again/raise people from the dead►. And
\add I am referring to the teaching that God\add* will judge \add some people and punish
them\add* eternally. 
\v 3  \add Instead of continuing to discuss these elementary truths\add*,
we\add (inc)\add* (OR, I) will \add go on to give people mature teaching\add*, if God allows it.
\v 4  \add I will explain why it is important to do that. Some\add* people have at one time fully understood
\add the message about Christ\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f*. They have experienced \add a relationship with Jesus
Christ\add* that God [EUP/MTY] gave \add to them\add*. They have received the Holy Spirit the same as
\add others have\add*. 
\v 5 They have experienced that God's message is good. And by what they have experienced
\add now\add*, they know how \add God will work\add* powerfully in the future. If those people reject
\add the message about Christ\add*, it will not be possible for anyone to persuade them to turn away from their sinful behavior
again! 
\v 6 What those \add believers who later renounce the message about Christ do is as
though\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f* they themselves are nailing the Son of God to a cross again! They are causing others to publicly despise
Christ. 
\v 7 Think about this: It is land on which rain has frequently fallen \f + \fr personification \f* and on which plants grow \f + \fr personification \f* that is useful for
the people who prepare the land that God has blessed. \add Similarly, it is those believers who have received many good things
from God and who do good deeds/things that please God, whom God will
bless\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f*. 
\v 8 But \add what will happen to believers who do deeds/things that do not please God will be like what happens to
land\add* on which \add only\add* thorns and thistles grow \f + \fr metaphor \f*.
\add Such land\add* is worthless. It has almost become land that God will curse, and eventually he will burn
\add its vegetation\add* \f + \fr metonymy \f*. 
\s Hebrews 6:9-12 
\s But God will not overlook all you have done for him. 
\p
\v 9 Although I am writing \add to you\add* like this as a \add warning\add*, I am certain concerning you whom I love that
\add you are doing\add* better than that. Specifically, I am certain that
\add you are doing\add* the things that are appropriate \add for those whom
God\add* has saved. 
\v 10 Since God always acts justly \f + \fr litotes \f*, he will not overlook all you have done
\add for him. He will also not overlook\add* \f + \fr metonymy \f* \add your showing that you
love\add* him by the way you helped your fellow believers and \add by the way you
still\add* help them. \add Instead, God will reward you for doing good
deeds\add*. 
\v 11 I strongly want each of you to diligently continue to fully expect to receive
\add what God has provided for you\add*, until you finally \add receive all that you have confidently expected to
receive\add*. 
\v 12 I do not want you to be lazy. \add Instead, I want\add* you to imitate those who by their patience and continuing to
trust in \add God\add* are receiving what he promised them. 
\s Hebrews 6:13-20 
\s Our confidence is in God because he promised to bless us, and he made an oath to confirm that he would do that.
\p
\v 13 When God promised to \add do things for\add* Abraham, he said that he would punish himself
\add if he did not do that\add*, because there was no one of greater importance to ask to punish him
\add if he did not do it\add*. 
\v 14 He said \add to Abraham\add*, “I will certainly bless you\add (sg)\add*, and I will certainly increase
\add the number of\add* your \add descendants\add* \f + \fr synecdoche \f*.” 
\v 15 As a result, after Abraham patiently waited \add for God to do what he
promised\add*, he obtained what \add God\add* promised him. 
\v 16  \add Keep in mind that when people promise something\add*, they ask a more important person to punish them if they do
not do what they promise. Furthermore, when people ask God to punish them
\add if they do not tell the truth\add*, that causes the people who are disputing to stop disputing.
\v 17 So, when God wanted to demonstrate very clearly ◄to us/to those people► who would receive what he had promised that he
would not change what he had purposed \add to do\add*, he solemnly guaranteed that he would declare himself guilty if he did
not do what he promised. 
\v 18 He did that to strongly encourage us as a result of our \add knowing\add* that
\add God has done\add* two things that cannot change. \add Namely, he promised to bless us, and he solemnly declared that he
would declare himself guilty if he did not bless us\add*. We \add know\add* that God, who did those things, cannot lie. We have
fled \add to him\add* in order that we might continue confidently to expect to receive what he promised us.
\v 19  \add Our confidently expecting\add* \f + \fr synecdoche \f* \add to receive what he has promised is
like\add* an anchor \f + \fr metaphor \f* that very firmly \f + \fr doublet \f* \add holds us fast. The one we confidently expect to help
us\add* \f + \fr synecdoche \f* \add is Jesus, who\add* goes into \add God's very presence, just like the high priests
went\add* behind the curtain into the innermost \add part of the tent in the barren
area\add* \f + \fr metaphor \f*. 
\v 20 Jesus went \add into God's presence\add* ahead of us\add (inc)\add* to
\add help\add* us when he became a high priest eternally in the way that Melchizedek was a high priest.
