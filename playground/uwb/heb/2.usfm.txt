\c 2  
\s Hebrews 2:1-4 
\s We will not escape God's punishment if we ignore such a great message of salvation.
\p
\v 1 So, \add since that is true\add*, we must pay very great attention to what we have heard
\add about God's Son\add*, in order that we do not drift away from it,
\add as a boat drifts off its course when people do not guide it\add* \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f*.
\v 2  \add God's laws that\add* were spoken by angels were valid, and God justly punished all who transgressed them and all who
disobeyed \\f + \\ft doublet \\f* them. 
\v 3 So, ◄we will certainly not escape \add God punishing us\add* if we ignore such a great
\add message about how God\add* \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* saves us!\f + \ft Or: how \f* can we escape
\add God punishing us\add* if we ignore such a great \add message about how
God\add* \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f* saves us?► \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* This \add new message\add* was first spoken by the Lord
\add Jesus\add* {The Lord \add Jesus\add* first spoke this \add message\add*}. Then it was confirmed to us by those who heard
\add what the Lord told them\add* {those who heard \add what the Lord told
them\add* confirmed it to us}. 
\v 4 God also confirmed to us \add that this message was true\add* by
\add enabling believers to do\add* many things that showed God's power, to do other miraculous things \\f + \\ft doublet \\f*, and
\add to do other things\add* by the gifts that the Holy Spirit distributed to them according to what
\add God\add* desired. 
\s Hebrews 2:5-9a 
\s God has determined that Christ, not angels or people, will rule everything.
\p
\v 5 God has not determined that the angels will rule over everything.
\add Instead, he has determined that Christ\add* will rule in the new world that
\add God\add* will \add create\add*. \add That is the new world\add* about which I am writing.
\v 6 Someone spoke to\add God about this\add* somewhere \add in the
Scriptures\add*, saying, 
\q ◄No one is worthy enough for you to think about him!\f + \ft Or: Who \f* is \add worthy
enough\add* for you to think about him?► \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* 
\q ◄No human is \add worthy enough\add* for you to care for him!\f + \ft Or: Is \f* any human
\add worthy enough\add* for you to care for him?► \\f + \\ft rhetorical question \\f* 
\q
\v 7  \add So it is surprising that\add* you have caused people to be for a little while inferior in rank to angels.
\q You have greatly honored \\f + \\ft doublet \\f* them \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f*, as \add kings are honored
with\add* a crown. 
\q
\v 8 You have put everything under their control \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f*. 
\p God has determined that people will rule over everything \\f + \\ft litotes \\f*. That
\add means that nothing will be omitted from their control\add*. But now, at this present time, we perceive that people do not
yet have authority over everything. 
\v 9 But we do know about Jesus, \add who truly has authority over
everything!\add* 
\s Hebrews 2:9b-13 
\s Jesus, the creator of everything, is the one who died for us, makes us holy, and proclaims us to be his brothers and
sisters. 
\p Jesus, for a little, while became inferior \add in rank\add* to angels in order to die on behalf of \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* everyone. He
became inferior when he suffered \add and\add* died, as God in his kindness
\add planned\add*. But now he has been greatly \add honored\add* \\f + \\ft doublet \\f*
\add by being\add* crowned \add as kings are\add*. 
\v 10 It was fitting that \add God\add* make\add Jesus\add* ◄perfect\f + \ft Or: all \f* that God intended him to be►. He was enabling many
people who would belong to him \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* to share his glory. God \add is the one
who\add* created all things, and \add he is the one\add* for whom all
things\add exist\add*. \add He perfected Jesus\add* by causing him to suffer
\add and die\add*. \add Jesus\add* is the one who enables \add God\add* to save people.
\v 11  \add Jesus\add*, the one who ◄makes people holy\f + \ft Or: sets \f* people apart for God►, and the ones who are ◄made holy\f + \ft Or: set \f* apart
for God► {whom he ◄makes holy\f + \ft Or: sets \f* apart \add for God\add*►}, all belong to God's family.
\add As a result, Christ\add* gladly \\f + \\ft litotes \\f* proclaims them to be \add like\add* his own
brothers\add and sisters\add*. 
\v 12  \add The Psalmist wrote what Christ said to God about us becoming\add* his brothers, in these words,
\q I will proclaim to my brothers how awesome you are \f + \ft (OR, what you
◄\add are like\f + \ft Or: have \f* done\add*►) \f* \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f*. 
\q I will sing praise to you in the midst of the congregation! 
\p
\v 13 And a prophet wrote \add in\add* another \add Scripture passage what Christ said about
God\add*, 
\q I will trust him. 
\p And in another \add Scripture passage, Christ said about those who are like
his\add* children, 
\q I and the ones that God has given me are here. 
\s Hebrews 2:14-18 
\s It is Jesus, not angels, who became a human to help us as our high priest.
\p
\v 14 So, since those \add whom God calls his\add* children are all human beings \\f + \\ft metonymy \\f*, Jesus also became a human being
\add just like them\add*. The devil has the power to cause people
\add to be afraid\add* to die, but Christ became human in order that by his dying he might make the devil powerless.
\v 15  \add Jesus did that\add* to free all of us who are like slaves \\f + \\ft metaphor \\f* all the time we live, because we are
\add forced to\add* be afraid to die. 
\v 16 Because \add Jesus became a human being\add*, it is not angels that he wants to help. No, it is we who trust God as
Abraham did whom he wants to help. 
\v 17 So, \add since he came to help humans, not angels\add*, he had to be made exactly like
\add us whom he calls\add* his own brothers \add and sisters\add*. He wants to be a high priest who
\add acts\add* mercifully \add to all people\add* and who acts faithfully in God's matters, so that people who had sinned would
no longer be guilty. 
\v 18  \add Specifically\add*, he is able to help those\f + \ft Or: us \f* who are
tempted\add to sin\add*. He can do that because he suffered, and he was also tempted
\add to sin like we are tempted to sin\add*.
