It was the middle of the night. The soldiers led Jesus to the house of the high priest to be questioned. Peter followed far behind. When Jesus was taken into the house, Peter stayed outside and warmed himself by a fire.

Inside the house, the Jewish leaders put Jesus on trial. They brought many witnesses who lied about him. However, their statements did not agree with each other, so they could not prove he was guilty. Jesus did not say anything.

Finally, the high priest looked directly at Jesus and said, “Tell us, are you the Messiah, the Son of the living God?”

Jesus said, “I am, and you will see me seated with God and coming in power from heaven.” The high priest tore his clothes in anger and shouted, “We do not need any more witnesses. You have heard him say that he is the Son of God. What is your judgment?”

They all answered, “He deserves to die!” Then they blindfolded him, spit on him, hit him, and mocked him.

Outside the house, a girl saw Peter and said, “You also were with Jesus!” Peter denied it. Later, another girl said the same thing, and Peter denied it again. Finally, the people said, “You were with Jesus because you both are from Galilee.”

Peter swore, saying, “May God curse me if I know this man!” Immediately, a rooster crowed, and Jesus turned and looked at Peter.

Peter went outside and cried bitterly. Meanwhile, when Judas, the betrayer, saw that Jesus had been condemned, he became full of sorrow and went away and killed himself.

Early the next morning, the Jewish leaders brought Jesus to the Roman governor, Pilate, hoping to have Jesus killed. Pilate asked him, “Are you the King of the Jews?”

Jesus answered, “You have said so, but my Kingdom is not an earthly kingdom. If it was, my servants would fight for me. But I have come to earth to tell the truth about God. Everyone who loves the truth listens to me.” Pilate said, “What is truth?”

After speaking with Jesus, Pilate went out to the crowd and said, “I find no guilt in this man.” But the Jewish leaders and the crowd shouted, “Crucify him!” Pilate replied, “He is not guilty.” But they shouted even louder. Then Pilate said a third time, “He is not guilty!”

But Pilate became afraid that a riot would start, so he handed Jesus over to them to be crucified. The soldiers whipped Jesus, put a royal robe and a crown made of thorns on him, and they mocked him, saying, “Look, the King of the Jews!”
