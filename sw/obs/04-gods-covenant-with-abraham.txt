====== 4. God’s Covenant with Abraham ======

Many years after the flood, there were again many people in the world, and they all spoke the same language. But the people did not obey God. Instead of having children and filling the earth, they gathered together and built a city.

They were very proud, and they did not care about what God said. They even began building a tall tower to reach heaven. God saw that if they all kept working together, they could do many evil things.

So He changed their language into many different languages and spread the people out all over the world. The city they had begun to build was called Babel, which means “confused.”

Hundreds of years later, God spoke to a man named Abram. God told him, “Leave your country and family and go to the land I will show you.”

So Abram obeyed. He took his wife, Sarai, and all his servants and herds of animals and went to the land God showed him, the land of Canaan. Abram lived there for many years. There God made a covenant with Abram. A covenant is an agreement between two parties.

God said, “Look all around you. All the land that you can see I will give to you and your descendants as an inheritance. I will bless you and make your name great.”

“I will make your descendants into a large nation, and I will be your God. I will bless those who bless you and curse those who curse you. All the people groups of the world will be blessed through you.” God also told Abram to circumcise all the men in his household as a sign of the covenant. Abram obeyed.

Abram believed God. God said that Abram was righteous through believing in God’s promise. But there was a problem. Abram and his wife were not able to have any children. So it seemed impossible that Abram could become the father of a large nation, but they waited in faith, believing what God had promised.

One day, Abram met Melchizedek, the priest of God Most High. Melchizedek blessed Abram and said, “May God Most High who owns heaven and earth bless Abram.” Then Abram gave Melchizedek a tenth of all he owned.
