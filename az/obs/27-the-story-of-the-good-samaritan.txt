Bu adam belə dedi: «“Allahın Rəbbi bütün qəlbinlə, bütün varlığınla, bütün gücünlə və bütün düşüncənlə sev” və “Qonşunu özün kimi sev”». İsa ona dedi: «Sən düz cavab verdin! Buna əməl et və yaşayacaqsan».

“The next person to walk down that road was a Samaritan. (Samaritans were the descendants of Jews and people from other nations. Samaritans and Jews hated each other.) When the Samaritan saw the man, he was filled with compassion. He cared for him and bandaged his wounds.”
