====== 1. Yaradılış ======


{{:en:obs:obs-01-01.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Bu hər bir şeyin necə yaranması barədədir. Tanrı kainatı və orada olan hər bir şeyi altı günə yaratdı. Başlanğıcda yer üzü qaranlıq və boş idi, heç bir görkəmi yox idi. Ancaq Tanrının Ruhu su üzərində gəzirdi.


This is how the beginning of everything happened. God created the universe and everything in it in six days. At first, the earth was dark and empty, and nothing had been formed in it. But God's Spirit was there over the water.

Sonra isə Tanrı danışaraq dedi; " Qoy işıq olsun!". Tanrı gördü ki, işıq yaxşıdır və onu "gündüz" adlandirdi. O gündüzu " qaranlıqdan ayırdı və qaranlığı "gecə" adlandırdı. Tanrı yaradılışın birinci günü işığı yaratdı.


Then God spoke and said, "Let there be light!" And there was light. God saw that the light was good and called it "day." He separated it from the darkness, which He called "night." God created the light on the first day of creation.

Yaradılışın ikinci günündə Tanrı danışdı və yer üzərində səma yaratdı.


On the second day of creation, God spoke and created the sky above the earth.

Üçüncü gündə, Tanrı danışaraq suyu qurudan ayırdı. O qurunu "yer " adlandırdı və suyu isə " dəniz" adlandırdı.


On the third day, God spoke and separated the water from the dry land. He called the dry land "earth," and He called the water "seas."

Sonra tanrı dedi; "Qoy yer üzü hər növ ağaclar və meyvələr hasil etsin". Və bu baş verdi. Tanrı gördü ki, yaratdığı hər şey yaxşıdır və O bütün bunlardan məmun oldu.


Then God said, "Let the earth produce all kinds of trees and plants." And that is what happened. God saw that what He had created was good, and He was pleased with it all.

Yaradılışın dördüncü günü, Tanrı danışaraq günəş, ay və ulduzları yaratdı. Tanrı bunları yaradaraq yer üzünə işıq verdi və gündüzlə gecənı, fəsillərlə illəri təyin etdi.


On the fourth day of creation, God spoke and made the sun, the moon, and the stars. God made them to give light to the earth and to mark day and night, seasons and years.

Beşinci gün, Tanrı suda üzən hər şeyi və bütün quşları yaratdı. Tanrı gördü ki, bunlar yaxşdır və O bunlara xeyir dua verdi.


On the fifth day, God created everything that swims in the water and all the birds. God saw that it was good, and He blessed them.

On the sixth day of creation, God said, "Let there be all kinds of land animals!" And it happened just like God said. Some were farm animals, some crawled on the ground, and some were wild. And God saw that it was good.


{{:en:obs:obs-01-09.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Then God said, "Let us make human beings in our image to be like us. They will have authority over the earth and all the animals."


{{:en:obs:obs-01-10.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


So God took some dirt, formed it into a man, and breathed life into him. This man's name was Adam. God planted a garden where Adam could live, and put him there to care for it.


{{:en:obs:obs-01-11.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


In the middle of the garden, God planted two special trees—the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. God told Adam that he could eat from any tree in the garden except from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. If he ate from this tree, he would die.


{{:en:obs:obs-01-12.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Then God said, "It is not good for man to be alone." But none of the animals could be Adam's helper.


{{:en:obs:obs-01-13.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


So God made Adam fall into a deep sleep. Then God took one of Adam's ribs and made it into a woman and brought her to him.


{{:en:obs:obs-01-14.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


When Adam saw her, he said, "At last! This one is like me! Let her be called 'Woman,' for she was made from Man." This is why a man leaves his father and mother and becomes one with his wife.


{{:en:obs:obs-01-15.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


God made man and woman in His own image, and He saw that it was very good. He blessed them and told them, "Have many children and grandchildren and fill the earth!" This all happened on the sixth day of creation.


{{:en:obs:obs-01-16.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


When the seventh day came, God had already finished His work. So God rested from all He had been doing. He blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on this day He rested from His work. This is how God created the universe and everything in it.
