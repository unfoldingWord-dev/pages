“Since the servant could not repay the debt, the king said, ‘Sell this man and his family as slaves to make payment on his debt.’”

“The servant fell on his knees before the king and said, ‘Please be patient with me, and I will pay everything back.’ The king felt pity for the servant and canceled all of his debt.”
