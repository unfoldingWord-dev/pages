Later that day, two of Jesus’ followers were going to a nearby town. As they walked, they talked about the death of Jesus and how the women said he was alive again. They wondered if Jesus really was the Messiah.

Jesus came up and started walking with them, but they did not recognize him. He asked what they were talking about, and they told him about all the terrible things that had happened during the last few days. They thought he was a stranger who had not heard about it.

Then Jesus explained to them what God’s Word says about the Messiah. He reminded them that the prophets said the Messiah would suffer and be killed, but would rise again on the third day. When they arrived at the town where they were going, it was almost night.

The two men invited Jesus to stay with them, so he did. Before they ate, Jesus picked up a loaf of bread, thanked God for it, then broke it. Suddenly, their eyes were opened, and they recognized that he was Jesus. At that moment, he disappeared.

The two men said to each other, “Our hearts were burning when he explained God’s Word to us!” Immediately, they returned to Jerusalem and told the disciples, “Jesus is alive! We have seen him!”

Suddenly, Jesus appeared! The disciples thought he was a ghost, but Jesus said, “Peace to you! Why are you afraid and doubting? Look at my hands and feet. Ghosts do not have bodies like I do.” To show he was not a ghost, he asked for a piece of cooked fish and ate it.

“I told you that everything written about me in God’s Word must be fulfilled,” Jesus said. Then he opened their minds so they could understand God’s Word. He said, “It was written long ago that the Messiah would suffer, die, and rise from the dead on the third day.”

“It was also written that repentance for forgiveness of sins would be proclaimed to all people groups, starting in Jerusalem. You are witnesses of these things.”

During the next forty days, Jesus appeared to his disciples and followers many times. Once, he even appeared to more than 500 people at the same time! He proved to his disciples in many ways that he was alive, and he taught them about the Kingdom of God.

At the end of the forty days, Jesus said to his disciples, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. So go, make disciples of all people groups by baptizing them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit and by teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you.”

“Remember, I will be with you always. Stay in Jerusalem until you receive power from above.” Then Jesus was taken up to heaven, and a cloud hid him from their sight. Jesus sat down at the right hand of God to rule over all things.
