Jesus did many miracles proving he is God. He walked on water, calmed storms, healed many sick people, drove out demons, raised the dead to life, and fed 5,000 people with five loaves of bread and two fish.


{{:en:obs:obs-49-03.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Jesus was also a great teacher. He taught that you need to love your neighbor the same way you love yourself.


{{:en:obs:obs-49-04.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


He also taught that you need to love God more than anything else, including your wealth.


{{:en:obs:obs-49-05.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Jesus taught that salvation is worth more than anything else in the world.


{{:en:obs:obs-49-06.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


He taught that not all people will receive him and be saved. Those who are not saved will be gathered at the end of the world and will burn forever in the fires of hell.


{{:en:obs:obs-49-07.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Jesus taught that God loves sinners very much. He is ready to forgive them and make them His children.


{{:en:obs:obs-49-08.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Jesus also taught that everyone in the world has sinned and is separated from God. Because of sin, everyone has become an enemy of God. God hates sin.


{{:en:obs:obs-49-09.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


But God loved the world so much that He gave His only son, Jesus, so that whoever believes in Him will not go to hell but will live with Him forever.

Because of your sin, you are guilty. You deserve death and God’s anger, but God poured out His anger on Jesus instead. When Jesus died on the cross, he received your punishment.


{{:en:obs:obs-49-11.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Jesus chose to die as a perfect, sinless sacrifice to take away your sins and the sins of the whole world. Because of Jesus, any sin can be forgiven, no matter what it is.


{{:en:obs:obs-49-12.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


No one can be saved by doing good things. Nothing you do can fix your relationship with God. Your sins can only be washed away if you believe that Jesus is the Son of God, and that he died and rose again to take away your sins.


{{:en:obs:obs-49-13.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Anyone who believes in Jesus and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be rejected. It does not matter if you are rich or poor, man or woman, old or young, or where you are from. God loves you and wants you to believe in Jesus so He can have a relationship with you.


{{:en:obs:obs-49-14.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Do you believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the only Son of God? Do you believe that you are a sinner and deserve God’s punishment? Do you believe that Jesus died on the cross to take away your sins? Jesus invites you to come to him, believe in him, and be baptized.


{{:en:obs:obs-49-15.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


If you believe this, you are a Christian! God has taken you out of Satan’s kingdom of darkness and put you into God’s Kingdom of light. All the old things are gone, because God makes all things new.


{{:en:obs:obs-49-16.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


If you are a Christian, your sins are forgiven because of what Jesus did. Now, when God looks at you, He does not see you as an enemy, but He sees you as a close friend.


{{:en:obs:obs-49-17.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


As a friend of God, you will want to follow Jesus’ teachings. Even though you are a Christian, you will still struggle with sin. But God says if you confess your sins, He is faithful and will forgive you and will give you strength to fight against sin.


{{:en:obs:obs-49-18.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


God tells you to pray, study His Word, worship Him with other Christians, and tell others what He has done for you. All of these things help you to grow in your relationship with Him.
