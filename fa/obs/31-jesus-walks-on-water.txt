بلافاصله پس از آن،عیسی به شاگردانش فرمود که سوار قایق شده،به آن طرف دریاچه بروند تا او بتواند مردم را روانه خانه و کاشانه شان کند و پس از آن به فراز تپه ای رفت و به دعا مشغول شد.عیسی در آنجا تا پاسی از شب ماند.

در ضمن،آنها فاصله زیادی تا خشکی داشتند.ایشان در خطر افتادند زیرا طوفان شروع به وزیدن گرفت و کشتی در میان امواج و باد به این طرف و آن طرف میرفت.

Jesus decided to go to them, so he walked on top of the water across the lake toward the boat!

The disciples were very afraid when they saw Jesus, because they thought they were seeing a ghost. Jesus knew that they were afraid, so he called out to them and said, “Do not be afraid. It is I!”

Then Peter said to Jesus, “Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water.” Jesus told Peter, “Come!”

So, Peter got out of the boat and started walking to Jesus on the surface of the water. But after a short distance, he turned his eyes away from Jesus and began to look at the strong wind and waves.

Then Peter became afraid and began to sink. He cried out, “Lord, save me!” Jesus reached out right away and grabbed him. Then he said to Peter, “O you of little faith, why did you doubt?”

When Peter and Jesus got into the boat, the wind immediately stopped. The disciples were amazed. They worshiped Jesus, saying to him, “Truly, you are the Son of God.”
