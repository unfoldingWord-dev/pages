فرشته خدا به زکریا گفت"همسر تو پسری خواهد زایید.تو نام او را یحیی خواهی گذاشت.او پیامبر بزرگی خواهد شد که قبل از مسیح موعود می آید."زکریا در پاسخ گفت"همسرم و من برای بچه دار شدن بسیار پیر هستیم!چطور ممکن است که این اتفاق بیفتد؟"

The angel answered, “I was sent by God to bring you this good news. Because you did not believe me, you will not be able to speak until the child is born.” Immediately, Zechariah was unable to speak. Then the angel left. Zechariah returned home, and his wife became pregnant.

The angel continued, “You are to name him Jesus. He will be the Messiah!” Mary replied, “How can this be, since I am a virgin?” The angel explained, “The Holy Spirit will come over you, and you will conceive. So your son will be called the Son of the Most High God.”

Not long after this, Mary went and visited Elizabeth. As soon as Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, Elizabeth’s baby jumped inside her. The women rejoiced together about what God had done for them. After visiting for three months, Mary returned home.

After Elizabeth gave birth to her baby boy, they named him John as the angel commanded. Then God allowed Zechariah to speak again. He said, “Praise God, because He has remembered His people! You, my son, will be called the prophet of the Most High God! You will prepare the way for the Messiah!”
