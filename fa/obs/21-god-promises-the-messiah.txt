Through the prophet Jeremiah, God promised that He would make a New Covenant, but not like God’s Covenant with Israel. In the New Covenant, God would write His law on the people’s hearts, the people would know God, they would be His people, and God would forgive their sins. The Messiah would start the New Covenant.

The coming Messiah would be a prophet, a priest, and a king. A prophet is a person who hears the words of God and then proclaims God’s words to the people. The coming Messiah would be the perfect prophet.

A priest is someone who makes sacrifices to God on behalf of the people to take away their sins. Priests also pray to God for the people. The coming Messiah would be the perfect high priest who would offer himself as a perfect sacrifice to God.

A king is someone who rules over a kingdom and judges the people. The coming Messiah would be the perfect king who would sit on the throne of his ancestor David, who would reign over the whole world forever, and who would judge honestly and make the right decision every time.

The prophets predicted the birth of the coming Messiah. Malachi foretold that a great prophet would come before the Messiah came. Isaiah prophesied that the Messiah would be born from a virgin. Micah said that he would be born in the town of Bethlehem.

The prophets also prophesied about the Messiah’s ministry. Isaiah said he would live in Galilee, comfort the broken-hearted, proclaim freedom to captives, and release to prisoners. He also predicted that the Messiah would heal sick people, including those who could not hear, see, speak, or walk.

Isaiah prophesied that the Messiah would be hated without reason and rejected. The Psalms foretold the Messiah’s that people would gamble for his clothes and he would be betrayed by a friend. (Psalms are Jewish worship songs in the Scriptures.) Zechariah foretold that the friend would be paid thirty pieces of silver for betraying him.

The prophets also told about how the Messiah would die. Isaiah prophesied that the Messiah would be spit on, mocked, and beaten. Then he would be pierced and hung on a tree where he would die.

The Messiah would be perfect, having no sin. He would die to receive the punishment for other people’s sin. His punishment would bring peace between God and people. For this reason, it pleased God to crush the Messiah.

Not only would the Messiah die, but the prophets foretold that God would raise him from the dead. Through the Messiah’s death and resurrection, God would complete His plan of salvation and start the New Covenant.

God showed the prophets many things about the coming Messiah, but the Messiah had not come yet. More than 400 years after the last of these prophecies was given, when the time was perfect, God sent the Messiah into the world.
