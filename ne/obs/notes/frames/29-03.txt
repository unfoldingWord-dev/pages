{{:en:obs:obs-29-03.jpg?nolink&640x360}}

“Since the **[[:en:key-terms:servant|servant]]** could not **pay the debt**, the **[[:en:key-terms:king|king]]** said, ‘Sell this man and his family as **[[:en:key-terms:servant|slaves]]** **to make payment on his debt**.’”


===== Translation Notes: =====

  * (Jesus continues the story.)
  * **pay the debt** - That is, “pay back the money he owed to the king.”
  * **to make payment on his debt** - This could be translated as, “and use the money received from selling them to pay part of what he owes me.”
