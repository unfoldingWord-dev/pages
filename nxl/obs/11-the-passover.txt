God warned Pharaoh that if he did not let the Israelites go, then he would kill all the firstborn males of both people and animals. When Pharaoh heard this he still refused to believe God.

God provided a way to save the firstborn of anyone who believed in him. Each family had to choose a perfect lamb or goat and kill it.

Then the Israelites needed to put some of its blood around the door of their house. They were to roast the meat and eat it quickly, along with bread that was made without yeast. They were to be ready to leave Egypt when they ate.

The Israelites did everything just as God had commanded them. In the middle of the night, God went throughout Egypt killing every firstborn son.

All the houses of the Israelites had blood around the doors, so God passed over those houses and everyone inside was safe. They were saved because of the lamb’s blood.

But the Egyptians did not believe God or obey his commands. So God did not pass over their houses. God killed every one of the Egyptians' firstborn sons and every firstborn of their animals as well.

Every Egyptian firstborn male died, from the firstborn of the prisoner in jail, to the firstborn of Pharaoh. There was much weeping in Egypt.

That same night, Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron and said, “Take the Israelites and leave Egypt immediately!” The Egyptian people also urged the Israelites to leave right away.
