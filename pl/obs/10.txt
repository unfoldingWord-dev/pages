Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh. They said, “This is what the God of Israel says, ‘Let my people go!’” Pharaoh laughed at them. Instead of letting the Israelites go free, he made their work even harder!

Pharaoh kept refusing to let the people go, so God sent ten plagues on Egypt. (A plague is a terrible disaster.) Through these plagues, God showed Pharaoh that He is more powerful than Pharaoh and all of Egypt’s gods.

God turned the Nile River into blood, but Pharaoh still would not let the Israelites go.

God sent frogs all over Egypt. Pharaoh begged Moses to take away the frogs. But after all the frogs died, Pharaoh hardened his heart and would not let the Israelites go.

So God sent a plague of gnats and then a plague of flies. Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron and told them they could leave if they stopped the plague. Moses prayed, and God removed all the flies from Egypt, but Pharaoh hardened his heart and would not let the people go.

Next God sent a sickness to kill all the farm animals that belonged to the Egyptians. Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he would not let the Israelites go.

Then God told Moses to throw ashes into the air in front of Pharaoh. When he did, painful skin sores appeared on the Egyptians, but not on the Israelites. God hardened Pharaoh's heart, and Pharaoh would not let the Israelites go free.

After that, God sent hail that destroyed the crops in Egypt and killed anybody who went outside. Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron and told them, “I have sinned. You may go.” So Moses prayed, and the hail stopped.

But Pharaoh sinned again and hardened his heart and would not let the Israelites go.

So God caused swarms of locusts to come over Egypt. These locusts ate what remained of the crops that the hail had not destroyed.

Then God sent darkness that lasted for three days. It was so dark that the Egyptians could not leave their houses. But where the Israelites lived, there was light.

Even after these nine plagues, Pharaoh still refused to let the Israelites go free. Since Pharaoh would not listen, there was one last plague that God planned to send. This would change Pharaoh’s mind.
