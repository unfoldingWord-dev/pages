Jesus sent his disciples to preach and teach. When they returned, they told Jesus what they had taught and done. Then Jesus invited them to come with him to a quiet place to rest for a while. So, they got into a boat and left.

But there were many people who saw Jesus and the disciples leave. They ran along the shore of the lake to get to the other side ahead of them. When Jesus and the disciples arrived, they were greeted by great crowds of people.

The crowd had over 5,000 men in it, not counting the women and children. Jesus felt great kindness towards the people. To Jesus, these people were like sheep without a shepherd. So he taught them and healed their sick.

As it got later in the evening, the disciples told Jesus, “It is late and there are no towns nearby. Send the people away so they can go get something to eat.”

But Jesus said to them, “You give them something to eat!” The disciples responded, “How can we do that? We only have five loaves of bread and two fish.”

Jesus called the crowd to him and told them to sit down in groups on the grass.

Then he took the five loaves of bread and the two fish, looked up to heaven, and blessed the food.

Jesus then started breaking the bread and fish. He gave the pieces to his disciples to give to the people. The disciples kept passing out the food, and it never ran out! All the people ate and were satisfied.

The disciples even picked up twelve baskets full of leftover food that had not been eaten. All the food came from the five loaves of bread and two fish.
