Jesus told many other stories about the Kingdom of God. He said, “The Kingdom of God is like a mustard seed that a man planted in his field. When it is a seed, it is the smallest seed of all.”

“But when it has grown, it is the largest of all garden plants, big enough that even the birds come and make nests in its branches.”

Jesus told another story, “The Kingdom of God is like yeast that a woman mixed into some bread dough until it spread all the way through.”

“The Kingdom of God is also like hidden treasure in a field, which a man found and then buried again. In his joy, he went and sold everything he had and bought that field.”

“The Kingdom of God is also like a pearl merchant who was looking for perfect pearls. When he found one of great price, he sold all that he had and bought it.”

Then Jesus told a story about people who trust in their own good deeds and despise other people. “Two men went up to the Temple to pray. One of them was a tax collector, and the other a religious leader.”

“The religious leader prayed like this, ‘Thank you God that I am not like other men—robbers, unjust men, adulterers, or even like that tax collector.’”

“‘I fast two times every week and I give you ten percent of everything I get.’”

“But the tax collector stood far away, did not even lift his eyes up to heaven, but beat his chest and prayed, ‘God, have mercy on me, a sinner.’”

Then Jesus said, “I tell you the truth, the tax collector went home forgiven, and not the religious leader. Everyone who is proud will be humbled, but whoever humbles himself will be lifted up.”
