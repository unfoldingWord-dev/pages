One day Peter said to Jesus, “Lord, how many times should I forgive my brother when he sins against me? Up to seven times?” Jesus said, “Not seven times, but seventy times seven!” By this, Jesus meant that we should always forgive. Jesus told this story.

“The Kingdom of God is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants. One of his servants owed a huge debt worth 200,000 years’ wages.”

“Since the servant could not repay the debt, the king said, ‘Sell this man and his family as slaves to make payment on his debt.’”

“The servant fell on his knees before the king and said, ‘Please be patient with me, and I will pay everything back.’ The king felt pity for the servant and canceled all of his debt.”

“The servant went out and found another servant who owed him a debt worth four months’ wages. The servant choked the man and said, ‘Pay me what you owe me!’”

“The man fell on his knees and said, ‘Please be patient with me, and I will pay everything back.’ But the servant refused and threw the man in prison until he could pay the debt.”

“Some other servants saw what had happened and were greatly disturbed. They went to the king and told him everything.”

“The king called the servant and said, ‘You wicked servant! I forgave your debt because you begged me. You should have done the same.’ In his anger the king threw the wicked servant into prison until he could pay back all of his debt.”

Then Jesus said, “This is what my heavenly Father will do to every one of you if you do not forgive your brother from your heart.”
