====== sacrifice ======


==== (sacrifice, offering) ====


===== Definition: =====


A sacrifice is an offering to God of something valuable as a form of worship.

    * The Israelites made several different kinds of sacrifices. These included sacrifices to ask God to forgive sin and sacrifices to thank him for blessings.
    * Most sacrifices involved killing an animal and offering it to God as a gift.

Animal sacrifices could never truly make a person clean from his sin. Only the sacrifice of Jesus, God's perfect, sinless Son, can cleanse people from sin.
 

===== Examples from the Bible stories: =====

  ***[03-14]** After Noah got off the boat, he built an altar and **sacrificed** some of each kind of animal which could be used for a **sacrifice**. God was happy with the **sacrifice** and blessed Noah and his family.
  ***[05-06]** "Take Isaac, your only son, and kill him as a **sacrifice** to me." Again Abraham obeyed God and prepared to **sacrifice** his son.
  ***[05-09]** God had provided the ram to be the **sacrifice** instead of Isaac.
  ***[13-09]** Anyone who disobeyed God's law could bring an animal to the Tent of Meeting as a **sacrifice** to God. A priest would kill the animal and burn it on the altar. The blood of the **sacrifice** covered the person's sin and made that person clean in God's sight.
  ***[17-06]** David wanted to build a temple where everybody could worship God and offer him **sacrifices**.
  ***[48-06]** Jesus is the Great High Priest. Jesus offered only one **sacrifice**, himself. This was the only **sacrifice** needed to take away the sin of the whole world.
