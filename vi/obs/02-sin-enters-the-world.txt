Adam và vợ người sống hanh phúc trong khu vườn xinh đẹp mà Chúa tạo dựng cho họ. Cả hai đều không mặc quần áo, nhưng họ không hề hỗ thẹn, vì tội lỗi chưa vào trong thế gian. Họ thường dạo chơi trong khu vườn và trò chuyện cùng Đức Chúa Trời.

Nhưng trong khu vườn có con rắn là loài xảo quyệt hơn cả. Nó hỏi người nữ rằng, "có thật Chúa cấm ngươi ăn những trái cây trong vườn?"

”Người nữ trả lời rằng:" Chúa nói với chúng tôi có thể ăn bất cứ trái cây nào trong vườn, ngoại trừ cây biết điều thiện và điều ác. Chúa bảo, 'nếu ngươi ăn hay đụng vào, thì sẽ chết.'

”Con rắn nói rằng:"Điều đó không thật! Chúa biết rằng khi ngươi ăn trái cây đó, ngươi sẽ giống như Chúa, biết được điều thiện và điều ác".

The woman saw that the fruit was beautiful and looked delicious. She also wanted to be wise, so she picked some of the fruit and ate it. Then she turned and gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it, too.

Suddenly, their eyes were opened, and they realized they were naked. They tried to cover their bodies by sewing leaves together to make clothes.

Then the man and his wife heard the sound of God walking through the garden. They both hid from God. Then God called to the man, “Where are you?” Adam replied, “I heard you walking in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked. So I hid.”

Then God asked, “Who told you that you were naked? Did you eat the fruit I told you not to eat?” The man answered, “You gave me this woman, and she gave me the fruit.” Then God asked the woman, “What have you done?” The woman replied, “The snake tricked me.”

God said to the snake, “You are cursed! You will slide on your belly and eat dirt. You and the woman will hate each other, and your children and her children will hate each other, too. The woman’s descendant will crush your head, and you will wound his heel.”

God then said to the woman, “I will make childbirth very painful for you. You will desire your husband, and he will rule over you.”

God said to the man, “You listened to your wife and disobeyed me. Now the ground is cursed, and you will need to work hard to grow food. Then you will die, and your body will return to dirt.” The man named his wife Eve, which means “life-giver,” because she would become the mother of all people. And God clothed Adam and Eve with animal skins.

Then God said, “Now that the human beings have become like us by knowing good and evil, they must not be allowed to eat the fruit of the tree of life and live forever.” So God sent Adam and Eve away from the beautiful garden. God placed large, powerful angels at the entrance to the garden to keep anyone from eating the fruit of the tree of life.
