Every **[[:vi:key-terms:egypt|Egyptian]]** firstborn male died, **from the firstborn of the prisoner in jail, to the firstborn of [[:vi:key-terms:pharaoh|Pharaoh]]**. Many people in **[[:vi:key-terms:egypt|Egypt]]** were crying and wailing because of their deep sadness.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **from the firstborn of the prisoner in jail, to the firstborn of Pharaoh**  - This is a way of saying that everyone's firstborn son diedâ€“from the son of the least important person to the son of the most important person, and everyone in between.
