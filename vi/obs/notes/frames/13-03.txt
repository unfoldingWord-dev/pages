  * **Three days later** - In other words, three days after they arrived at Mount Sinai and God first spoke to them.
  * **prepared themselves spiritually** - This refers to ceremonial cleansing in preparation to meet with God. This could be translated as, “got ready to meet with God” or, “prepared themselves to meet with God.”
  * **loud trumpet blast** - This could be translated as, “and a loud sound came from a horn” or, “and a horn was blown and it made a loud sound” or, “and they heard the loud sound of a horn blowing.” Trumpets were made out of ram's horns. They were used that day to call the people to gather at the mountain and meet with God.
  * **Only Moses was allowed to go up** - This could be translated as, “God permitted Moses to go up, but he did not permit anyone else to go up.”
