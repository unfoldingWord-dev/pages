I will send you to **[[:vi:key-terms:pharaoh|Pharaoh]]** so that you can **bring the [[:vi:key-terms:israel|Israelites]] out of their [[:vi:key-terms:servant|slavery]] in [[:vi:key-terms:egypt|Egypt]]**.

==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **suffering of my people**  - This could be translated as, “the very harsh treatment that my people are experiencing. Some languages might translate this as, “how the Egyptians are giving my people terrible pain.”
    * **my people**  - This refers to the Israelites. God had made a covenant with Abraham and his descendants that He would bless them and make them into a great nation. Through this covenant, the Israelites became God's own people.
    * **bring … out of their slavery in Egypt**  - This can be translated as, “set them free from being slaves in Egypt” or, “bring them out of Egypt where they are now slaves.”
