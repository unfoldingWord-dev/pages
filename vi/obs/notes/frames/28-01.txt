**One day**, a **rich young ruler**  **came up to [[:vi:key-terms/jesus|Jesus]]** and asked him, “**[[:vi:key-terms/good|Good]] [[:vi:key-terms/teacher|teacher]]**, what must I do **to have [[:vi:key-terms/eternal-life|eternal life]]**?” Jesus said to him, “**Why do you call me 'good'**? **There is only one who is good, and that is [[:vi:key-terms/god|God]]**. But if you want to have eternal life, **[[:vi:key-terms/obey|obey]]** **[[:vi:key-terms/gods-law|God's laws]]**.”


==== Translation Notes: ====


  * **One day**  - This phrase introduces an event that happened in the past, but does not state the specific time. Many languages have a similar way to begin telling a true story.
  * **rich young ruler**  - This man was already a rich and powerful political official, even though he was still young.
  * **came up to Jesus**  - That is, “approached Jesus.”
  * **Good teacher**  - That is, “righteous teacher.” He was not saying that Jesus was simply a skilled teacher.
  * **to have eternal life**  - That is, “to receive eternal life” or, “to live with God forever.” Also consider how “eternal life” was translated on **[[:vi:obs:notes:frames:27-01|[27-01]]]** and see the note about that there.
  * **Why do you call me 'good'**  - Jesus is not denying that he is God. Rather, he is asking if the ruler understands that Jesus is God.
  * **There is only one who is good, and that is God**  - Another way to say this would be, “The only one who is truly good is God” or, “God is the only one who is truly good.”
