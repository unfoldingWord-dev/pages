  * **guarding their flocks** - A “flock” is a group of sheep. The shepherds were caring for their sheep, and protecting them from harm or theft.
  * **a shining angel** - This could also be translated as, “an angel surrounded by a bright light.” The shining light would have seemed even brighter in contrast to the darkness of the night.
  * **they were terrified** - The appearance of the supernatural angel was extremely frightening.
  * **Do not be afraid** - This often means, “stop being afraid.” The shepherds were very afraid when they saw the angel so he was telling them they did not need to be afraid.
