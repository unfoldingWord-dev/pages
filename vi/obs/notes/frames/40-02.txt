The soldiers brought **[[:vi:key-terms/jesus|Jesus]]** to a place called “**the Skull**” and nailed his arms and feet to the **[[:vi:key-terms/cross|cross]]**. But Jesus said, “**[[:vi:key-terms/god-father|Father]]**, **[[:vi:key-terms/forgive|forgive]] them, because they do not know what they are doing**.” **[[:vi:key-terms/pilate|Pilate]]** commanded that they write, “**[[:vi:key-terms/king-of-jews|King of the Jews]]**” on a sign and put it on the cross above Jesus’ head.


==== Translation Notes: ====


  * **the Skull**  - A hill near Jerusalem with a white, rocky top that was shaped somewhat like the top of a skull.
  * **forgive them, because they do not know what they are doing**  - That is, “they do not understand the meaning of what they are doing, so please forgive them.” The soldiers thought Jesus was only a criminal who deserved to die. They did not understand that he was the Son of God.
