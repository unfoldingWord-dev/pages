Then **[[:vi:key-terms/god|God]]** allowed **[[:vi:key-terms/zechariah-nt|Zechariah]]** to speak again. Zechariah said, “**[[:vi:key-terms/praise|Praise]] God**, because he has remembered his people! You, my son, **will be called**  **the [[:vi:key-terms/prophet|prophet]]** of the **Most High God**  who will prepare the people to receive the **[[:vi:key-terms/messiah|Messiah]]**!”

==== Translation Notes: ====


  * **Elizabeth**  - See the note about Elizabeth on **[[:vi:obs:notes:frames:22-05|[22-04]]]**.
  * **Praise God**  - That is, “We should all praise God.”
  * **will be called**  - This is another way of saying, “will be” or, “will be known as.” John would actually be the Prophet of the Most High God.
  * **the prophet**  - That is, “the very important prophet.” John would be the prophet that the Old Testament prophets had predicted would come before the Messiah.
  * **Most High God**  - Another way to say this would be, “the God who is greater than everything” or, “the God who rules over everything.”
  * //A Bible story from//  - These references may be slightly different in some Bible translations.
