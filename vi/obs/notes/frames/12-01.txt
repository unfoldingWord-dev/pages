The **[[:vi:key-terms:israel|Israelites]]** were very happy to leave **[[:vi:key-terms:egypt|Egypt]]**. **They were no longer [[:vi:key-terms:servant|slaves]]**, and they were **going**  to the **[[:vi:key-terms:promised-land|Promised Land]]**! The **[[:vi:key-terms:egypt|Egyptians]]** gave the Israelites whatever they asked for, even gold and silver and other valuable things. Some people from other nations **[[:vi:key-terms:believe|believed]]** in **[[:vi:key-terms:god|God]]** and went along with the Israelites as they left Egypt.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **They were no longer slaves**  - This could be translated as, “They were not slaves anymore.”
    * **going**  – Some languages may use a more specific word like “traveling” since they would be going a long distance to the Promised Land.
    * **Promised Land**  - This is the land that God had promised that he would give to Abraham's descendants.
