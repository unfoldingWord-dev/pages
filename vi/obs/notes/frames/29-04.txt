  * (Jesus continues the story.)
  * **fell on his knees** - That is, “quickly knelt down on the ground.” This was a way to show his humility and his desire for the king to help him. Make sure it doesn't sound like he fell down accidentally.
  * **before the king** - This means, “in front of the king.”
  * **felt pity** - That is, “felt compassion for” or, “felt sorry for.” The king knew that the servant and his family would suffer greatly if they were sold into slavery.
  * **canceled all of his debt** - This can be translated as, “said that the servant did not need to pay back any of the money that he owed the king.”
