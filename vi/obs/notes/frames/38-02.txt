One of **[[:vi:key-terms/jesus|Jesus']]** **[[:vi:key-terms/disciple|disciples]]** was a man named **[[:vi:key-terms/judas|Judas]]**. Judas was **in charge of the [[:vi:key-terms/apostle|apostles']] moneybag**, but he **loved money**  and often stole money out of the bag. After Jesus and the disciples arrived in **[[:vi:key-terms/jerusalem|Jerusalem]]**, Judas went to the **[[:vi:key-terms/jewish-leaders|Jewish leaders]]** and offered to **[[:vi:key-terms/betray|betray]]** Jesus to them in exchange for money. He knew that the Jewish leaders denied that Jesus was the **[[:vi:key-terms/messiah|Messiah]]** and that they were plotting to kill him.


==== Translation Notes: ====


  * **in charge of the apostles’ moneybag**  - That is, “responsible to hold the apostles' money” or, “responsible to hold the bag that had the disciples' money in it and to distribute funds from it.”
  * **loved money**  – That is, “highly valued money” or, “wanted money.” Some languages would not use the same word that can be used for “loved people.”
