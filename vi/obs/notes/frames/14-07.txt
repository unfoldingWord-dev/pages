But the people did not listen to **[[:vi:key-terms:caleb|Caleb]]** and **[[:vi:key-terms:joshua|Joshua]]**. They became angry with **[[:vi:key-terms:moses|Moses]]** and **[[:vi:key-terms:aaron|Aaron]]** and said, “**Why did you bring us**  to **this horrible place**? We should have stayed in **[[:vi:key-terms:egypt|Egypt]] rather than be killed in battle and our wives and children made [[:vi:key-terms:servant|slaves]]**.” The people wanted to choose a different leader to take them back to Egypt.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **Why did you bring us**  – This is not a real question. It is a way that some languages use to say, “You should not have brought us.”
    * **this horrible place**  - They considered Canaan to be “horrible” because they thought it was so dangerous that they would all be killed.
    * **rather than be killed in battle and our wives and children made slaves**  - This could be translated as, “If we fight against the Canaanites, they will kill us men and force our wives and children to be their slaves.”
