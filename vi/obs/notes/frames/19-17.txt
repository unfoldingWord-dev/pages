===== Jeremiah Suffered for God [19-17] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-19-17.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Most of the time, the people did not **[[:vi:key-terms:obey|obey]]** **[[:vi:key-terms:god|God]]**. They often mistreated the **[[:vi:key-terms:prophet|prophets]]** and sometimes even killed them. Once, the prophet **[[:vi:key-terms:jeremiah|Jeremiah]]** was put into a **dry well**  and left there to die. He sank down into the mud that was in the bottom of the well, but then the **[[:vi:key-terms:king|king]] had [[:vi:key-terms:mercy|mercy]] on him**and ordered his servants to pull Jeremiah out of the well before he died.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **dry well**  - The well did not currently have any water in it, but it did still have mud in the bottom. This could be translated as, “empty well.”
    * **had mercy on him**  – This means he was kind to Jeremiah and helped him.
