{{:en:obs:obs-05-01.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Ten years after **[[:vi:key-terms:abraham|Abram]]** and **[[:vi:key-terms:sarah|Sarai]]** arrived in **[[:vi:key-terms:canaan|Canaan]]**, **they still did not have a child**. So Abram's wife, Sarai, said to him, “Since **[[:vi:key-terms:god|God]]** has not allowed me to have children and now I am too old to have children, here is my **[[:vi:key-terms:servant|servant]], [[:vi:key-terms:hagar|Hagar]]**. **Marry her also**  so she can **have a child for me**.”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **still did not have a child**  - Without a child, Abram had no descendants to become a great nation.
    * **Marry her also**  - Abram would take Hagar as a second wife, but Hagar would not have the full status of a wife as Sarai did. She was still Sarai's servant.
    * **have a child for me**  - Since Hagar was Sarai's servant, Sarai would be considered the mother of any children that Hagar bore.
