    * **both kingdoms**  - This refers to both the kingdoms of Israel and Judah.
    * **Empire**  - A country was called an “empire” when it was powerful enough to extend its authority over many other countries.
    * **took away**  - That is, “stole.” They stole these valuable things and carried them back to Assyria.
