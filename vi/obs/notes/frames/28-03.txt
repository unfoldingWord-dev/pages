  * **ever since I was a boy** - Another way to say this would be, “from the time I was a child until now.”
  * **What do I still need to do?** - That is, “What else do I need to do” or, “What do I need to do in addition to these?”
  * **loved him** - Jesus had compassion on him. Choose a word for love that is consistent with the kind of love God has for people.
