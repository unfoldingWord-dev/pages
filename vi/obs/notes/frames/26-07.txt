===== The Attempt to Kill Jesus [26-07] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-26-07.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


The people of **[[:vi:key-terms/nazareth|Nazareth]]** dragged **[[:vi:key-terms/jesus|Jesus]]** out of the **place of [[:vi:key-terms/worship|worship]]** and brought him to the edge of a cliff to throw him off of it in order to kill him. **But Jesus walked through the crowd**  and left the town of Nazareth.


==== Translation Notes: ====


  * **place of worship**  - That is, “the building where the Jewish people gathered to worship God.” This can also be translated as “worship building.” See how you translated it in **[[:vi:obs:notes:frames:26-02|[26-02]]]**.
  * **But Jesus walked through the crowd**  - “But” could be translated with a strong contrast word or phrase such as “But instead” or, “However” to show that the people were not able to do to Jesus what they had planned to do.
