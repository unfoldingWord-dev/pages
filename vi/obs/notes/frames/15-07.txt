{{:en:obs:obs-15-07.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


The **[[:vi:key-terms:israel|Israelites]]** were angry when they found out that the **[[:vi:key-terms:gibeon|Gibeonites]]** had deceived them, but they kept the **[[:vi:key-terms:peace|peace]]** treaty they had made with them because it was a **[[:vi:key-terms:promise|promise]]** before **[[:vi:key-terms:god|God]]**. Sometime later, the **[[:vi:key-terms:king|kings]]** of another people group in **[[:vi:key-terms:canaan|Canaan]]**, the **[[:vi:key-terms:amorite|Amorites]]**, heard that the Gibeonites had made a peace treaty with the Israelites, so they combined their armies into one large army and attacked **[[:vi:key-terms:gibeon|Gibeon]]**. The Gibeonites **sent a message to [[:vi:key-terms:joshua|Joshua]] asking for help**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **sent a message to Joshua asking for help**  - This could be translated as, “sent some of their people to tell Joshua that they needed the Israelites to help defend them against their enemies.”
