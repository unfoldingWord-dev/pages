The **[[:vi:key-terms/priest-high|high priest]]** asked Stephen, “**Are these things [[:vi:key-terms/true|true]]**?” Stephen replied by reminding them of many of the great things **[[:vi:key-terms/god|God]]** had done from the time of **[[:vi:key-terms/abraham|Abraham]]** to the time of **[[:vi:key-terms/jesus|Jesus]]**, and how God's people continually **[[:vi:key-terms/disobey|disobeyed]]** him. Then he said, “You stubborn and **[[:vi:key-terms/rebel|rebellious]]** people **always reject the [[:vi:key-terms/holy-spirit|Holy Spirit]]**, just as **your ancestors**  always rejected God and killed his **[[:vi:key-terms/prophet|prophets]]**. But you did something worse than they did! You killed the **[[:vi:key-terms/messiah|Messiah]]**!”
