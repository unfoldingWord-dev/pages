{{:en:obs:obs-48-09.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


When **[[:vi:key-terms/god|God]]****sent the last plague on [[:vi:key-terms/egypt|Egypt]]**, he told each **[[:vi:key-terms/israel|Israelite]]** family to kill **a perfect [[:vi:key-terms/lamb|lamb]]** and spread **its [[:vi:key-terms/blood|blood]]** on the tops and sides of their **door frames**. When God saw the blood, he **passed over**  their houses and did not kill their firstborn sons. This event is called the **[[:vi:key-terms/passover|Passover]]**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


  * **sent the last plague on Egypt**  – That is, “caused the final disaster to come on Egypt.” This was the tenth plague when God caused the firstborn sons of the Egyptians to die.
  * **a perfect lamb**  - That is, “a lamb without any defect.”
  * **its blood**  - That is, “the lamb's blood.”
  * **door frames**  – If door frames are not known, this could be translated as, “doors.”
  * **passed over**  - This could also be translated as, “passed by” or, “went by.” You may want to connect how this is translated with how “Passover” is translated.
