Then **[[:vi:key-terms/jesus|Jesus]]** asked the **law expert**, “What do you think? Which one of **the three men**  **was a neighbor**  to the man who was robbed and beaten?” He replied, “The one who was **[[:vi:key-terms/mercy|merciful]]** to him.” Jesus told him, “**You go and do the same**.”


//A Bible story from: Luke 10:25-37//


==== Translation Notes: ====


  * **law expert**  - That is, “an expert in the Jewish law.” See how you translated this term in **[[:vi:obs:notes:frames:27-01|[27-01]]]**.
  * **the three men**  - The three men were the priest, the Levite, and the Samaritan.
  * **neighbor**  - Jesus is using the word “neighbor” in a broader sense than in **[[:vi:obs:notes:frames:27-02|[27-02]]]**. “Neighbor” here refers to anyone that we meet who needs our help.
  * **was a neighbor**  - This can also be translated as, “behaved as a neighbor” or, “was a friend” or, “acted in a loving way”. See how you translated “neighbor” in **[[:vi:obs:notes:frames:27-02|[27-02]]]** and **[[:vi:obs:notes:frames:27-03|[27-03]]]**.
  * **You go and do**  – That is, “You, too, should go and do” or, “Now you must do.” Jesus was commanding the law expert to do as the Samaritan did.
  * **do the same**  – That is, “love others, even your enemies.” Make sure it does not sound like “the same” is only referring to helping a wounded man.
  * //A Bible story from//  - These references may be slightly different in some Bible translations.
