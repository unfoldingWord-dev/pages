    * **But despite all this**  - This could be translated as, “But even though God provided food, water, clothing, and everything that they needed.”
    * **Even so**  - This could be translated, “Even though the Israelites complained and grumbled against him.”
    * **God was still faithful to his promises**  - This could be translated, “God continued to do what he had told Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob he would do.” He provided their descendants with what they needed so they that could live and become a great nation and eventually own the land of Canaan.
