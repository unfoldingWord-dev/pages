==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **When Joshua was an old man**  – It may be clearer to say, “Many years later, when Joshua was an old man.” Joshua was over 100 years old at this time.
    * **remain faithful to God**  - In other words, they would be loyal to God. They would worship and serve only God; they would not worship or serve any other gods.
    * **follow his laws**  - This means that the people would obey the laws that God had given them already as part of the covenant.
    * //A Bible story from//  - These references may be slightly different in some Bible translations.
