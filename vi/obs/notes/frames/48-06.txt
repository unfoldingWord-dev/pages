===== The Great High Priest [48-06] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-48-06.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


For hundreds of years, **[[:vi:key-terms/priest|priests]]** continually offered **[[:vi:key-terms/sacrifice|sacrifices]]** to **[[:vi:key-terms/god|God]]** for people to show the punishment that they deserved for their **[[:vi:key-terms/sin|sins]]**. But those sacrifices could not take away their sin. **[[:vi:key-terms/jesus|Jesus]]** is the **[[:vi:key-terms/priest-high|Great High Priest]]**. Unlike other priests, **he offered himself**  as the only sacrifice that could take away the sin of all the people in the world. Jesus was the perfect high priest because he **took the [[:vi:key-terms/punish|punishment]]** for every sin that anyone has ever committed.


==== Translation Notes: ====


  * **he offered himself**  - This could also be translated as, “Jesus allowed himself to be killed.”
  * **took the punishment**  - That is, “received the punishment in his own body.”
