The two men invited **[[:vi:key-terms/jesus|Jesus]]** to stay with them, so he did. When they were ready to eat the evening meal, Jesus picked up a loaf of bread, thanked **[[:vi:key-terms/god|God]]** for it, and then broke it. Suddenly, they recognized that he was Jesus. But at that moment, **he disappeared from their sight**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


  * **he disappeared from their sight**  - This could also be translated as, “he was gone” or, “he was no longer there.”
