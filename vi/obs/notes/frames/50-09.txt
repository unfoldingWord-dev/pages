{{:en:obs:obs-50-09.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


“The weeds represent the people **who belong to the [[:vi:key-terms/evil|evil]] one**. The enemy who planted the weeds represents **the [[:vi:key-terms/satan|devil]]**. The harvest **represents the end of the world**, and **the harvesters**  represent **[[:vi:key-terms/god|God's]]** **[[:vi:key-terms/angel|angels]]**.”


==== Translation Notes: ====


  * **who belong to the evil one**  - That is, “who obey the evil one” or, “who are ruled by the evil one.”
  * **the evil one**  - This is another title for Satan. It could be translated as, “Satan,” but the title, “evil one” describes his character.
  * **the devil**  - This could also be translated as, “Satan.”
  * **represents the end of the world**  - That is, “represents what will happen to people at the end of the world.”
  * **the harvesters**  – This could also be translated as, “the men who harvest the ripe grain” or, “the workers who gather in the ripe grain.”
