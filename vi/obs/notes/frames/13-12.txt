==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **made a golden idol**  - Aaron took the things made of gold that the people had brought to him, melted them, combined them, and formed them into the shape of a calf.
    * **wildly worship**  - The people were sinning by worshiping the idol and also by doing sinful things as they worshiped it.
    * **listened to his prayer**  - God always hears prayer. In this situation, “listened” means that God agreed to do what Moses asked.
