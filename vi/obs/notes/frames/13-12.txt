  * **made a golden idol** - Aaron took the things made of gold that the people had brought to him, melted them, combined them, and formed them into the shape of a calf.
  * **wildly worship** - The people were sinning by worshiping the idol and also by doing sinful things as they worshiped it.
  * **listened to his prayer** - God always hears prayer. In this situation, “listened” means that God agreed to do what Moses asked.
