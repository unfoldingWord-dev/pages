  * **One day**  - This phrase introduces an event that happened in the past, but does not state the specific time. Many languages have a similar way to begin telling a true story.
  * **tax collectors**  â€“ Tax collectors were considered to be the worst of sinners because often they stole money from people by collecting a higher tax than the government required.
