They put **[[:vi:key-terms/paul|Paul]]** and **[[:vi:key-terms/silas|Silas]]** in the most secure part of the prison and even locked up their feet. Yet **in the middle of the night**, they were **singing songs of [[:vi:key-terms/praise|praise]] to [[:vi:key-terms/god|God]]**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


  * **in the middle of the night**  – This could be translated as, “very late at night” or, “very early in the morning.” This was when it was completely dark outside, when people would normally be asleep.
  * **singing songs of praise to God**  - This can also be translating as, “praising God by singing” or, “singing songs to praise God” or, “singing songs that gave praise to God.”
