{{:en:obs:obs-14-09.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


When the people heard this, they were sorry **they had [[:vi:key-terms:sin|sinned]]**. They took their weapons and went to attack the people of **[[:vi:key-terms:canaan|Canaan]]**. **[[:vi:key-terms:moses|Moses]] warned them not to go**because **[[:vi:key-terms:god|God]] was not with them**, **but they did not listen to him**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **they had sinned**  - It may be necessary to add, “they had sinned by disobeying God's command to conquer the peoples of Canaan.”
    * **Moses warned them not to go**  - This means that Moses told them not to go to fight against the Canaanites because they would be in danger if they did that.
    * **God was not with them**  – In other words, God would not be with them to help them. Because of the Israelites' disobedience, God withdrew from them his presence, protection, and power.
    * **but they did not listen to him**  - They did not obey Moses. They went to attack the Canaanites anyway.
