  * **God sent a plague** – This could be translated as, “God caused there to be a plague” or, “God caused a plague (of gnats) to come over the land of Egypt.”
  * **gnats** - These were tiny, biting insects flying in large swarms, annoying and landing on all the people and animals of Egypt.
  * **flies** - These were much bigger flying insects that were both annoying and destructive. There were so many of these flies that they covered everything, even filling the Egyptians' houses.
  * **hardened his heart** - See note in **[[:vi:obs:notes:frames:10-04|[10-04]]]**.
