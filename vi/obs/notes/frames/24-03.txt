When people heard **[[:vi:key-terms/john-baptist|John's]]** message, many of them **[[:vi:key-terms/repent|repented]] from their [[:vi:key-terms/sin|sins]]**, and John **[[:vi:key-terms/baptize|baptized]]** them. Many **[[:vi:key-terms/jewish-leaders|religious leaders]]** also came to be baptized by John, but they **did not repent**  or **confess their sins**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


  * **repented from their sins**  - This could also be translated as, “repented concerning their sins” or, “changed their minds about their sins” or, “turned away from their sins.”
  * **did not repent**  - That is, “did not turn away from their sins.”
  * **confess their sins**  - To confess is to acknowledge that something is true. These leaders did not want to acknowledge that they had sinned. This may be translated as, “confess that they had sinned.”
