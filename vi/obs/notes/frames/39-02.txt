  * **lied about him** - That is, “told lies about him” or, “falsely accused him of doing something wrong.”
  * **their statements did not agree with each other** - This could be translated as, “they said things about Jesus that were very different from each other” or, “the witnesses said things about Jesus that contradicted each other.”
  * **he was guilty of anything** - That is, “that he had done anything wrong.”
