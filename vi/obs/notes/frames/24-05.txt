===== Not the Messiah [24-05] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-24-05.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


Some **[[:vi:key-terms/jew|Jews]]** asked **[[:vi:key-terms/john-baptist|John]]** if he was the **[[:vi:key-terms/messiah|Messiah]]**. John replied, “I am not the Messiah, but there is someone coming after me. **He is so great**  that I am **not even worthy to untie his sandals**.”


==== Translation Notes: ====


  * **He is so great**  - This could be translated as, “He is so important.”
  * **not even worthy to untie his sandals**  - In other words, “compared to him, I am not important enough to do even the most menial task for him.” Untying sandals was a very low job, something a slave would do.
