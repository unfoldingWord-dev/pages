    * **ground is cursed**  - As punishment for Adam's disobedience, the earth would no longer be fruitful. Adam would have to work very hard to raise enough food to eat.

    * **mother of all people**  - This means that she would be the female ancestor of all people. Some languages say “she would be the grandmother of all people.”
