===== Phụ chú: =====

  * **he told them** - That is, “he told the men there.” He was probably not telling Mary and Martha to roll the stone away.
  * **Roll the stone away** - Some languages may prefer to say, “Roll the stone away from the opening of the tomb.”
  * **Martha** - Martha was the sister of Lazarus and Mary. See **[[:vi:obs:notes:frames:37-01|[37-01]]]**.
  * **He has been dead for four days** - This could also be translated as, “He died four days ago and his body is lying there.”
