{{:en:obs:obs-14-14.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


After the **[[:vi:key-terms:israel|Israelites]]** had wandered in the wilderness for forty years, all of them **who had [[:vi:key-terms:rebel|rebelled]] against [[:vi:key-terms:god|God]]** were dead. Then God led **the people**  to the edge of the **[[:vi:key-terms:promised-land|Promised Land]]** again. **[[:vi:key-terms:moses|Moses]]** was now very old, so God chose **[[:vi:key-terms:joshua|Joshua]]** to help him lead the people. God also **[[:vi:key-terms:promise|promised]]** Moses that **one day**, he would send **another [[:vi:key-terms:prophet|prophet]] like Moses**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **who had rebelled against God**  - This could be translated, “who had refused to obey God when he told them to go into the Promised Land.”
    * **the people**  - That is, the children of the generation that died.
    * **one day**  - This means, “some time in the future.”
    * **another prophet like Moses**  - Like Moses, this man would be an Israelite, he would speak God's words to the people, and he would lead the people.
