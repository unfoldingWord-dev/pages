===== Crossing the Jordan River [15-02] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-15-02.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


The **[[:vi:key-terms:israel|Israelites]]** had to cross the **[[:vi:key-terms:jordan-river|Jordan River]]** to enter into the **[[:vi:key-terms:promised-land|Promised Land]]**. **[[:vi:key-terms:god|God]]** told **[[:vi:key-terms:joshua|Joshua]]**, “**Have the [[:vi:key-terms:priest|priests]] go first**.” When the priests started to step into the Jordan River, **the water upstream stopped flowing**  so the Israelites could cross over to the other side of the river on dry ground.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **Have the priests go first**  – For some languages it may be helpful to add, “Have the priests go before the rest of the people to cross the river.”
    * **the water upstream stopped flowing**  — In some languages it may be helpful to add, “and the water in front of them flowed away downstream.”
