Then **[[:vi:key-terms:jesus|Jesus]]** told the **[[:vi:key-terms:disciple|disciples]]** to get into the boat and sail to the other side of the lake while **he dismissed the crowd**. After Jesus had sent the crowd away, he went up on a **mountainside** to **[[:vi:key-terms:pray|pray]]**. Jesus was there all alone, and he prayed until late at night.
