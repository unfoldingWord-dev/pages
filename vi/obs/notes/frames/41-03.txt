The day after **[[:vi:key-terms/jesus|Jesus]]** was buried was a **[[:vi:key-terms/sabbath|Sabbath]]** day, and **the [[:vi:key-terms/jew|Jews]] were not permitted**to go to a **[[:vi:key-terms/tomb|tomb]]** on that day. So very early on the morning after the Sabbath day, several women prepared to go to Jesus’ **[[:vi:key-terms/tomb|tomb]]** to put more **burial spices**  on his body.


==== Translation Notes: ====


  * **the Jews were not permitted**  – The Sabbath day rules did not permit a Jew to walk very far or to do any other kind of work.
  * **burial spices**  - This refers to sweet-smelling spices that were placed on a dead body to cover the bad smell. This can also be translated as, “sweet-smelling spices” or, “sweet-smelling oils” or, “sweet-smelling plants.”
