**[[:vi:key-terms/jesus|Jesus]]** also said, “A **[[:vi:key-terms/servant|servant]]** is **not greater than**  his **[[:vi:key-terms/lord|master]]**. Just as the authorities of this world have hated me, they will torture and kill you **because of me**. Although **in this world**  you will **[[:vi:key-terms/suffer|suffer]]**, be encouraged because I have defeated **[[:vi:key-terms/satan|Satan]]**, the one who rules this world. If you **remain [[:vi:key-terms/faithful|faithful]] to me****to the end**, then **God will [[:vi:key-terms/save|save]] you**!”


==== Translation Notes: ====


  * **not greater than**  - That is, “not more important than” or, in this case, “not treated better than.”
  * **because of me**  - That is, “because you obey me” or, “because you teach people about me” or, “because you belong to me.”
  * **in this world**  - This could also be translated as, “in this lifetime.”
  * **remain faithful to me**  - That is, “Keep obeying me.”
  * **to the end**  - That is, “to the end of your life.”
  * **will save you**  - This refers to spiritual salvation rather than physical deliverance from harm. It has already been stated that many believers will be killed or tortured.
