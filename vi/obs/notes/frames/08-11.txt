{{:en:obs:obs-08-11.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


So **[[:vi:key-terms:jacob|Jacob]]** sent **his older sons**  to **[[:vi:key-terms:egypt|Egypt]]** to buy food. The brothers **did not recognize [[:vi:key-terms:joseph|Joseph]]** when they stood before him to buy food. But Joseph recognized them.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **his older sons**  - These were Joseph's older brothers who had sold him into slavery.
    * **did not recognize Joseph**  - They did not know that the man was Joseph, because now Joseph was much older than when they last saw him, and he was dressed as an Egyptian ruler.
