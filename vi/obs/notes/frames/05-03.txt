{{:en:obs:obs-05-03.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


God said, “I am **[[:vi:key-terms:god|God]]** Almighty. I will make a **[[:vi:key-terms:covenant|covenant]]** with you.” Then **[[:vi:key-terms:abraham|Abram]]** bowed to the ground. God also told Abram, “You will be the **father of many nations**. I will give you and your **[[:vi:key-terms:descendant|descendants]]** the land of **[[:vi:key-terms:canaan|Canaan]]** as their possession and **I will be their God**  forever. You must **[[:vi:key-terms:circumcise|circumcise]]****every male in your family**.”


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **father of many nations**  - Abram would have many descendants, and they would have their own lands and rule themselves. They and others would remember that Abram was their ancestor and would honor him.
    * **I will be their God**  - Another way to say this is, “I will be the God that they will worship.”
    * **every male in your family**  - This could be translated as, “every boy and man in your family.” This included Abram's servants and his descendants.
