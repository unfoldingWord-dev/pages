==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **on behalf of**  - This may be translated as, “for the benefit of” or, “in the place of.”
    * **as a substitute for the punishment for their sins**  - God allowed people to bring animals to sacrifice for their sin as a reminder of the punishment that they deserved and their dependence on God to remove their sin. God accepted these sacrifices as a temporary covering for sin and did not punish the people for it.
    * **perfect high priest**  - Unlike the other high priests, the Messiah would never sin, and he would permanently take away all the sins of the people.
    * **offer himself**  – That is, “allow himself to be killed.”
    * **perfect sacrifice**  - That is, “a sacrifice that has no fault or imperfection.”
