===== Not All Will Be Saved [49-06] =====


{{:en:obs:obs-33-02.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**[[:vi:key-terms/jesus|Jesus]]** taught that some people will **[[:vi:key-terms/receive|receive]]** him and be **[[:vi:key-terms/save|saved]]**, but **others will not**. He said that some people are like good soil. They receive the **[[:vi:key-terms/good-news|good news]]** of Jesus and are saved. Other people are like the hard soil of a path, where the **seed of [[:vi:key-terms/word-of-god|God's word]]** does not enter and does not produce any harvest. Those people reject the message about Jesus and will not enter into **[[:vi:key-terms/kingdom-of-god|his kingdom]]**.


==== Translation Notes: ====


  * **others will not**  - That is, “other people will not receive him and therefore will not be saved.”
  * **seed of God's word**  - This can be translated as, “seed, which can be compared to God's word.” This phrase makes a comparison between seed and God's word.
