**When the time was near for [[:vi:key-terms/mary|Mary]] to give birth**, the **[[:vi:key-terms/rome|Roman]] government**told everyone to go **for a census**  to the town where their ancestors had lived. **[[:vi:key-terms/joseph-nt|Joseph]]** and Mary had to make a long journey from where they lived in **[[:vi:key-terms/nazareth|Nazareth]]** to **[[:vi:key-terms/bethlehem|Bethlehem]]** because their ancestor was **[[:vi:key-terms/david|David]]** whose hometown was Bethlehem.


==== Translation Notes: ====


  * **When the time was near for Mary to give birth**  - That is, “When it was near the end of Mary's pregnancy.”
  * **Roman government**  - Rome had conquered and ruled over Israel at this time.
  * **for a census**  - That is, “to be counted for the government record” or, “so that the government could write their names on a list” or, “to be counted by the government.” This census was probably made for the purpose of taxing the people.
