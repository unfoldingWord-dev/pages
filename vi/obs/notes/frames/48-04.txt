{{:en:obs:obs-48-04.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


**[[:vi:key-terms/god|God]]** **[[:vi:key-terms/promise|promised]]** that one of **[[:vi:key-terms/eve|Eve's]]** **[[:vi:key-terms/descendant|descendants]]** would **crush [[:vi:key-terms/satan|Satan's]] head**, and Satan would **wound his heel**. This meant that Satan would kill the **[[:vi:key-terms/messiah|Messiah]]**, but God would **[[:vi:key-terms/raise|raise]] him to [[:vi:key-terms/life|life]] again**, and then the Messiah will crush the power of Satan forever. Many years later, God revealed that **[[:vi:key-terms/jesus|Jesus]]** is the Messiah.


==== Translation Notes: ====


  * **crush Satan's head**  - This could also be translated as, “step on Satan's head and smash it down flat” or, “shatter Satan's head by stepping on it.” This is an image of a person stepping on the head of a snake. The head is completely crushed, and the snake is dead and therefore harmless.
  * **wound his heel**  - This is an image of a snake on the ground biting a person's foot. In this case, Satan would cause the Messiah to suffer, but would not destroy him.
  * **raise him to life again**  - That is, “make him alive again.”
