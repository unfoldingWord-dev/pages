==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **At last it was time for**  - “At last” means “finally” or, “after a long wait.” To make it clear what “time” refers to, you could say, “after they had wandered in the desert for 40 years, God finally permitted.”
    * **two spies to the Canaanite city of Jericho**  - This could be translated as, “two men to Jericho, a city in Canaan, to find out information about it.” Also see the notes for, “spy out the land” in **[[:vi:obs:notes:frames:14-04|[14-04]]]**.
    * **protected by strong walls**  - This could be translated as, “completely surrounded by thick, strong walls made of stone to protect it from their enemies.”
    * **escape**  – It is also possible to add, “escape from people in Jericho who wanted to harm them.”
    * **her family**  - Rahab asked for protection for her father, mother, brothers, and sisters. Use your word for family that includes these people.
