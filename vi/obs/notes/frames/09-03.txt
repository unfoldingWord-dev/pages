The **[[:vi:key-terms:egypt|Egyptians]]** forced the **[[:vi:key-terms:israel|Israelites]]** to build many buildings and even whole cities. The hard work made their lives **miserable**, but **[[:vi:key-terms:god|God]] [[:vi:key-terms:bless|blessed]] them**, and they had even more children.


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **miserable**  â€“ This means that they suffered terribly because of how harshly they were treated and how hard they were forced to work. They also felt very discouraged.
    * **God blessed them**  - God took care of them, helping them endure the severe treatment and even caused them to become more numerous by giving them children.
