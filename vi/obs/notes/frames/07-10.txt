==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **lived peacefully**  - This refers to the fact that Esau and Jacob were not angry at each other and did not fight with each other.
    * **buried him**  - This could mean that they dug a hole in the ground, placed Isaac's body in it, and covered the hole with dirt or stones. Or it could mean that they placed Isaac's body in a cave and covered the opening.
    * **covenant promises**  - These were the promises that God made in his covenant with Abraham.
    * **passed on from Isaac to Jacob**  - The promises went from Abraham to his son Isaac, and now to Isaac's son Jacob. Esau did not receive the promises. See also **[[:vi:obs:notes:frames:06-04|[06-04]]]**.
