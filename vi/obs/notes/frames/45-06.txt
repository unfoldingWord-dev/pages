{{:en:obs:obs-45-06.jpg?nolink&640x360}}


A young man named **[[:vi:key-terms/paul|Saul]]** agreed with the people who killed Stephen and **guarded their robes**  while they threw stones at him. That day, many people in **[[:vi:key-terms/jerusalem|Jerusalem]]** started **[[:vi:key-terms/persecute|persecuting]]** the followers of **[[:vi:key-terms/jesus|Jesus]]**, so the **[[:vi:key-terms/believer|believers]]** fled to other places. **But in spite of this**, they **[[:vi:key-terms/preach|preached]]** about Jesus everywhere they went.


==== Translation Notes: ====


  * **guarded their robes**  - This could be translated as, “watched over their coats.” He was probably making sure they didn't get stolen or damaged.
  * **But in spite of this**  – The Jewish leaders thought they could stop the spread of Jesus' teaching by persecuting his followers. Instead, this caused them to scatter and spread the message even more widely.
