**[[:vi:key-terms:moses|Moses]] was afraid and did not want to go**to **[[:vi:key-terms:pharaoh|Pharaoh]]** because he thought he could not speak well, so **[[:vi:key-terms:god|God]]** sent **Moses’ brother, [[:vi:key-terms:aaron|Aaron]]**, to help him. God warned Moses and Aaron that Pharaoh would be **stubborn**.


//A Bible story from: Exodus 1-4//


==== Translation Notes: ====


    * **was afraid and did not want to go**  - Moses knew that Pharaoh wanted to kill him, and he did not believe that he could do what God wanted him to do.
    * **Moses' brother, Aaron**  - Aaron was Moses's actual brother from his Israelite mother and father. Aaron would have been at least several years older than Moses.
    * **stubborn**  - This means the Pharaoh would refuse to obey God. You may also want to add, “stubborn and refuse to listen (or obey).”
    * //A Bible story from//  - These references may be slightly different in some Bible translations.
